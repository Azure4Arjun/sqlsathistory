## Title: Data Architectures in Azure for Analytics  Big Data
## Abstract:
### This session is a technical overview of data platform choices in Azure, with a focus on analytical and big data solutions. We will cover several reference architectures prevalent for cloud-based systems. Key criteria for selecting components of a multi-platform analytics architecture will be shared, such as: data latency, schema changes, data formats, data integration vs. data virtualization, scalability, and user tools/language support. Attendees of this session will become familiar with the most commonly used data services in Azure, including considerations for making sound decisions when designing a data architecture to support analytics and big data.
