## Speaker: Brad Marshall
## Title: Getting the warm "Fuzzies" with SSIS

# RESTful Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#7---Birmingham-2009)
Event Date: 30-05-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Development
## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: RESTful Data
## Abstract:
### REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.
