## Title: Yes! Making Performance Tuning Easier with Query Store
## Abstract:
### In our day-to-day struggles with performance issues we use built-in and third-party tools to discover and analyze what went wrong with a particular query or stored procedure and then we try to fix them. However, sometimes we wish that there would be a way to keep a good historical baseline for comparison.  Microsoft introduced query store in SQL Server 2016 to help with these challenges and answers some of the obvious performance questions. In this session, we will demonstrate how to use query store to characterize your workload and more easily find and fix some of the problem you may have with your unruly queries and gigantic store procedures.
