## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: Ten Things Power BI Can Do for Your Business
## Abstract:
### In the world of data, we spend much of our time talking about software, and for good reason: the modern wave of tools is dramatically superior to the tools of even five years ago. But there’s a related question that bears revisiting: WHAT should we be doing with those tools? While that may seem like an obvious question, the very existence of the revolutionary new tools makes now a great time to revisit the fundamentals of how we view our relationship with data. 

Spoiler alert: many of the obvious valuable things were prohibitively difficult to execute using previous tools – so much so that we’ve forgotten what we should be doing! The speaker (Rob Collie) has seen it all in the process of helping literally hundreds of organizations revolutionize their relationships with data, and in this thought-provoking and non-technical talk, he will share 10 recurring and valuable patterns observed within the past 2-3 years.
