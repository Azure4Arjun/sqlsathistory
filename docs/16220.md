## Title: Using PowerView and Hadoop to Unlock Hidden Market
## Abstract:
### A practical way to derive business value from big data is to microtarget customers, but where do you begin? In this session, we examine real data from one of the nation's largest cable TV providers and combine it with data from the 2010 census and other data sources. In addition, we demonstrate how to use Hadoop and the Microsoft BI stack with this integrated data to develop powerful analytics quickly and easily. We demystify the process of working with big data by showing you first how to gather and load the data into Hadoop, and then how to extract a subset of that data and apply data visualization to reveal insightful patterns that can be used to connect more effectively with customers.
