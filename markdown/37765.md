## Title: Securing data in Microsoft SQL Server - Part-1
## Abstract:
### My experience at many dozens of companies indicates that more than 90% of all database implementations don't follow some of the most fundamental best practices.  Learn to view security differently and how basic builtin features can be leveraged to make your systems both more maintainable and more secure.  Features covered include schema use and a detailed comparison between Ownership Chaining, Execute-As and Certificate Signing.
