## Title: Indexes: Under the Hood
## Abstract:
### Iâ€™m sure we all have heard that using indexes is one way to tackle and solve those troublesome resource-heavy queries. In this talk we will be going through how indexes improve and sometimes hinder query performance. We will also look at a few different types of indexes and some use cases where they play best in query optimization. Will also be covering how indexes are structured, read by SQL Server and index fragmentation.
