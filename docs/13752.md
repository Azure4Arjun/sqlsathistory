## Title: MicroORMs – Keeping Your DBA Happy
## Abstract:
### Developers like the reduced complexity and increased productivity that an ORM can bring while DBAs don't care for the data models that often result. Using an ORM with an existing data model is often a nightmare. But writing all of that data mapping code is such a pain! What if we could have a solution that gave us the best of both worlds and made the developers AND the DBAs happy? MicroORMs might be the answer. In this session, we’ll explore PetaPOCO, a MicroORM.
