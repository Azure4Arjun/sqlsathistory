## Title: Managing a Technical Team: Lessons Learned
## Abstract:
### I got promoted to management a couple of years ago, and despite what I previously believed, there were no fluffy pillows and bottles of champagne awaiting me.  My team liked me, but they didn't exactly stoop and bow when I entered the room.  I've spent the last year relearning everything I thought I knew about management, and what it means to be a manager of a technical team.  This session is intended for new managers, especially if you've come from a database (or other technical) background.
