## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

# Query Data Store
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#524---South-Florida-2016)
Event Date: 18-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sam Mesel
## Title: Query Data Store
## Abstract:
### Analyzing query performance can be tricky. It involves knowing several dynamic management views (DMVs) and accessing query plans that are still in the query cache. If you need to get performance metrics for a query which is no longer in the cache, or if your server is restarted it will be an impossible task.
Query Data Store is a new  feature that comes to help DBAs. By persisting query execution data over time, it allows reviewing of statements / plans / properties / statistics.
This session will show you how to enable and use QDS features, like: obtaining queries with plan changes over time; analyze queries by CPU / Memory / other counters; forcing a plan; and other gems.

## Title: SSIS Factory (Dobler Consulting)
## Abstract:
### Assume that you want to create packages to load 100's files (text or Excel) that you receive from vendors and structure of data in the files are different.  How long it can take? How about creating a simple tool for your manager who doesn't know anything about SSIS  to create packages for transferring data between servers?  You want to find out which package, among 100's of them  already running, update/insert a particular table . How long it will take to open each package and get the answer? 

We can automate all these process using C# (or Visual Basic) and SSIS SDK. Can it be more interesting if the conversion of those 2008 packages to 2012/2014 and deploy it to the new SSISDB using project deployment model can be automated too? If you are an SSIS expert with some knowledge of programming and like automation, you will have fun in this session.

## Speaker: Ben Galluzzo
## Title: Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTE) are a temporary result set used within an SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, that can be used in place of a subquery and can help simplify more complex queries such as when joining to the same result set multiple times.

We'll begin with an overview of how a Common Table Expression is constructed.  Then we'll build some queries using derived tables, and as the queries we build get more unwieldy, demonstrate how the query can be simplified by the use of a CTE.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Scaling for best performance: Partitioned views.
## Abstract:
### Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition.  Even though that is correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. 

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to imitate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining both partitioned views and table partitioning as well as inMemory tables to give us an ability to use double partition elimination based on two different keys as well as the ability to move hot spots data into inMemory OLTP.

# A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#524---South-Florida-2016)
Event Date: 18-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Shabnam Watson
## Title: A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
## Abstract:
### You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel, SQL Server Management Studio and other third party tools, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT
## Abstract:
### The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.

## Speaker: Richie Rump
## Title: Who's Afraid of Entity Framework?
## Abstract:
### Do any applications in your environment use SQL written not by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are it is using the Microsoft Entity Framework (EF).

EF and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is EF a technology that developers should even be using? This session reviews what EF is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how it works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by EF Finally, we'll review EF-generated T-SQL and give some tips on how to improve performance.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: SQL Server Disaster Recovery and High Availability Overview
## Abstract:
### When it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with SQL Server, there are a lot of options. Most business owners (and many DBAs) lump disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) together. And while they do share some pieces, they also call for different strategies. Should you use one or more of these options? And what criteria should you use to make the choice? It’s important that you understand the decision tree that can guide you to select the right option(s) for your organization and that you can clearly explain those choices to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated. This session will give you a high-level understanding of the options, their costs and complexities, and reasons for using each of them.

# Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#524---South-Florida-2016)
Event Date: 18-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sebastian Meine
## Title: Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.
