## Title: Rolling Database Snapshots
## Abstract:
### You want a recent version of your database to move reporting workload off production, using SQL 2005-2008R2 Enterprise but not yet using SQL 2012/2014? Consider rolling database snapshots. This approach works with or without database mirroring, to continuously provide a recent version of your database to support read-only and reporting workloads. This solution will be compared to other alternatives, a working demo presented, with shared source code.
