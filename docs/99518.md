## Title: Wait Wait Do Tell Me
## Abstract:
### Hurry up and wait, it happens to all of us, even SQL Server.  Why is SQL Server waiting?  What can we do about it?  These questions will be addressed as we define what a wait really is in SQL Server and some approaches to reduce the waiting.  This session, targeted at data professionals, managers, developers, and sysadmins, will also explore a few of the common SQL waits and specifically what we can do about them.
