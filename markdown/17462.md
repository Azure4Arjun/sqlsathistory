## Title: Database Design Disasters: Common Mistakes Found in the Wild
## Abstract:
### Not every system has a database architect available to design it. But what happens when a database is created and the proper care wasn't taken into designing it? This session will take a real-world look into my experiences with some database design choices. We'll take a deep look into these design choices including a detailed discussion on why they didn't work and what could have been done better. We may even take a peek into SQL Server internals. This session is primarily for data professionals that are new to database design.
