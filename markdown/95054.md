## Title: Advanced Power BI Modeling Techniques
## Abstract:
### Creating a Power BI data model is pretty easy, but sometimes we have to deal with more complex scenarios the require us to dig a little deeper. 

In this session we'll take your modeling skills to the next level as we explore a few advanced techniques that deal with displaying measures or KPIs in the rows of a table (as opposed to the columns), dynamic currency conversions and an alternate approach to role-playing dimensions.
