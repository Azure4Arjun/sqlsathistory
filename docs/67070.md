## Title: SQL Server ColumnStore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Come and learn how the SQL Server 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will have some insight into how CSI's have been updated in SQL Server 2014  2016, as well.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.
