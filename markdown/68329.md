## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
## Abstract:
### "If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers don’t do, it’s use transactions as often as we should.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.

1) Understand what transactions are and what they do.

2) Learn how to use transactions in combination with error handling to roll back changes on errors

3) Learn how transactions affect logging and locking.
