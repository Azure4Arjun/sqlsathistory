## Title: Overview of Security Investments in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### Join me for an overview of the most recent security investments for SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database in the areas of encryption, data filtering and data masking. I will showcase a real-life user scenario with examples and demos of Always Encrypted, Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking. The demos include a real working .NET application with source code for testing. This is based on the session and demos I co-presented with Microsoft at SQL Summit 2015 so if you missed Summit or the presentation and are interested in learning what Microsoft is doing in the area of security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB then this is the session for you.
