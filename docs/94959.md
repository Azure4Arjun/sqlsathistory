## Title: Power BI Performance Improvement
## Abstract:
### It is frustrating that a Power BI report is running very slow even if the actual Power BI dataset is small. Or some visuals run too long and just time out. It is important to be able to do performance tuning against your Power BI data model and your DAX query. 
This is a level 300 presentation which we will look at:
1). The analytical engine behind Power BI (called Vertipaq Engine), 
2). An overview of the query architecture of each DAX query,
3). How to optimize the query performance. 
This presentation is best for audience who has basic understanding Power BI, data modeling, and DAX.
