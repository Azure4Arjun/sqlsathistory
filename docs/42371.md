## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: Database Design Throwdown
## Abstract:
### Everyone agrees that great database performance starts with a great database design. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees which design options are best. Data architects and DBAs have debated database design best practices for decades. Systems built to handle current workloads are unable to maintain performance as workloads increase.

Attend this new and improved session and join the debate about the pros and cons of database design decisions. This debate includes topics such as logical design, datatypes, primary keys, indexes, refactoring, code-first generators, and even the cloud. Learn about the contentious issues that most affect your end users and how to avoid them.
