## Title: Database Projects
## Abstract:
### Learn about database projects.  Relieve yourself of deployment script nightmares.  Integrate the database with your application's nightly builds.  Link all of your database object changes to TFS tickets.  Deploy your database using DACPACs and guarantee that the database created in dev and tested in QA, is *the* database that ends up in production and other client facing environments.  You can even create unit tests!!!  Database projects are a powerful tool.  Attend this session and find out how they can help you!
