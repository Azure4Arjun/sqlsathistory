# Think like the Cardinality Estimator
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-962)
Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Taiob Ali
## Title: Think like the Cardinality Estimator
## Abstract:
### SQL Server uses a phase during query optimization, called cardinality estimation (CE). This process makes estimates bases on the statistics as to how many rows flow from one query plan iterator to the next.  Knowing how CE generates these numbers will enable you to write better TSQL code and, in turn, influence the type of physical operations during query execution.  Based on that estimated rows, the query processor decides how to access an object, which physical join to use, how to sort the data.  Do you know how the CE generates these numbers?  What happens when you have multiple predicates, range predicates, variable values that are “NOT KNOWN” to the optimizer, or you have predicate values increasing in ascending order? Do you know what will happen if your predicate is using a value that is outside of the histogram range?  

In this session, I will show you how CE estimates in all of these scenarios, and you will walk out better equipped to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query p

# Relational Design Critique
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-962)
Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Database Design  Architecture
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Relational Design Critique
## Abstract:
### The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Building Your First SQL Server Container Lab in Docker
## Abstract:
### A few years back, virtualization changed the way to work with SQL and infrastructure. Now, the next chapter is opening and it’s all about containers. Containers can make the DBA’s job of creating and deploying servers much easier freeing them up for other tasks such as performance tuning and security. 

In this session, we will go over the concepts of containers, their general capabilities, and then build, connect, and configure a SQL Server in a container for use as a private lab.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Becoming Ever More Intimate with your Indexes
## Abstract:
### Among the many critical and basic concepts to understand within SQL Server comes the concept of indexes. Indexes can be a significant asset or a scary detriment to your environment. During this session we will work through the basics of indexing within SQL Server and then explore some of the more interesting misconceptions I have encountered. 

Do you know how useful your indexes are? Do you know if your indexes might be a bit piggy? Do you know the impact of the indexes on your execution plans? These are just a few of the many questions that I will cover throughout the session as we move quickly through this important topic.

Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Steve Jones
## Title: Adopting a Compliant Database DevOps Process
## Abstract:
### DevOps is transforming software development, with many organizations and individuals adopting lean development practices, implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and performing on-demand deployments to their production environments. However, the database is largely ignored and seen as a bottleneck for a DevOps software development process. We will discuss the challenges of database development and deployment and examine why many developers find the database to be an impediment. We examine the risks of sensitive data in the development process and how you can ensure that data security concerns do not get in the way of the need for speed and agility. We’ll look at how you can adopt a Compliant Database DevOps approach that removes the database bottleneck while ensuring compliance with regulations governing the use of data within your organization such as GDPR, HIPPA or SOX.  We’ll discuss the techniques used to include the data

# Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-962)
Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
## Abstract:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad relational database design (whether they know what the term "normalized" means or not.) Normalization is a key to great relational designs, but there is so much more to be considered. A normalized database that suffers from poor naming, too many or too few indexes, terrible interfaces, and so on can derail your design's value to the user.  In this session I will present primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Data Virtualization with PolyBase
## Abstract:
### PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.

Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Optimizing Backup Performance Using Data Science Techniques
## Abstract:
### One of the most important tasks for a database administrator is taking (and testing!) backups.  As databases get larger and larger, the amount of time it takes to perform a backup can grow as well, to the point where your backups take longer than your available backup window.  There are several settings we can use to optimize backup performance, such as buffer counts, maximum transfer size, and the number of files, but trying every combination of settings on a single production-sized database could take weeks or even months.  In this talk, we will apply data science techniques to the problem of backup settings optimization and look at different models for approaching the problem and analyzing data.  Some statistics background would be helpful, but is not required; the big requirement is a desire to speed up backups.

Event Date: 25-04-2020 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Internals  Performance
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: An In-depth Look Inside SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.
