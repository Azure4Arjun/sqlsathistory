## Title: Why I won't hire you and what you can do about it!
## Abstract:
### As a hiring manager, I see the same mistakes over and over again. In this session we'll talk about common mistakes in resumes, interviews, social media and how you can avoid them. We'll also discuss lost opportunities and how not to miss them. This information applies to both internal and external candidates.
