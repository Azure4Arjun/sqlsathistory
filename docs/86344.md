## Title: Processing Analysis Services Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### For large in-memory Analysis Services Tabular models, the design of table partitions and the scheduled refresh/processing operations has significant implications for query performance, resource utilization, processing duration, and database availability. This session will review the tabular model's processing operation types, design decisions such as parallelism and transactions, and provide examples of Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) scripts and PowerShell scripts used to support the processing of Tabular models. Additionally, common Azure and on-premises job automation and orchestration tools used in the processing of Tabular models will be demonstrated including Azure Automation, SQL Server Agent, and SSIS.
