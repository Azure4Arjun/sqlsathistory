## Speaker: Rodrigo Cabello
## Title: Predictive Maintenance for airplane turbines with IoT, bringing deep learning to the edge.
## Abstract:
### We will present an end to end solution for aeroplane turbine predictive maintenance in the edge
Moreover, the session will cover the following points:
- Introduction to predictive maintenance
- How to use Deep Learning and RNN to solve predictive maintenance problems
- Machine Learning workflow for the solution proposed. We will provide all the details of our model's implementation and the technology used: Databricks, Python and Tensorflow
o Data Pre-processing and Feature selection
      â€¢Normalization
o Model selection
o Training  Testing
o Evaluation Metrics
o Deployment of the model using a lightweight version of Tensorflow: TFLite. This provides the tools needed to deploy a lightweight model in the edge without compromising its accuracy.
- Development of different IoT edge modules and how to deploy them in a RaspberryPi
     o Sensor engine module
     o Predictive module for ARM32 Arch
- How to send telemetry to the Cloud
- Analytics  BI: Data Visualization with PowerBI
