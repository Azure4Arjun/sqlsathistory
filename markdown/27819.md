## Title: When Cluster and Virtualization Aren't Enough: How to Create an Application Availability Framework
## Abstract:
### Join us for a talk on how to create an application availability framework for any SQL Server implementation. Clustering and virtualization solved some of the issues around high availability, but then these "infrastructure-up" approaches raised new challenges, including rigid configuration rules and restrictions, expensive software stacks, and complex operational models. In this webinar, we'll show you how you can focus on what matters most- your applications. Whether or not your environment already uses virtualization or clustering, this webinar will show you how to create an application availability framework that provides heterogeneous instance mobility from anything to anything, anywhere - truly physical, virtual, OS,  SQL Server version agnostic. Ready for a new approach to assured availability? Attend this talk to learn how.
