## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data masking is likely to become a new legal requirement.  Don't let this catch your organization unaware and flat-footed!

For decades, IT has been negligent, using production data during software development and testing, exposing sensitive data to those not authorized to access it.  That decades-old practice must end.

Data masking is the solution for providing non-production environments (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) with realistic but artificial data for development and testing, while reducing the surface area of risk for breaching data.

The alternative, generating test data, incurs classic problems of engineering bias as well as blindness to true-to-life data scenarios which arise in the "wild".

Masking real production data retains realistic data conditions and distributions while merely obfuscating real data.

Masking is important, and sophisticated software packages are available today, but the field is new enough that there is lots of room for improvement in all of them.
