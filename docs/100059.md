## Title: Aggregations in Power BI: How to unlock the power of big datasets
## Abstract:
### Aggregations are one of the most important optimization methods for managing big datasets in Power
BI. Combined with Direct Query storage mode, they allow big datasets to be analyzed efficiently by
answering high level analytical queries quickly from memory while sending more detailed queries back
to the source database.
In this session, you will learn about the concept of aggregations, different table storage modes in Power
BI, how to set up aggregation tables and configure them to improve query performance. You will also
learn how to use DAX Studio to determine if the aggregations are being used.
Prerequisite: Basic knowledge of data modeling in Power BI Desktop.
