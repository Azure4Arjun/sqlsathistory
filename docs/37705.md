## Speaker: Michael Phipps
## Title: Debugging For Fun and Profit
## Abstract:
### Bugs. Ugh. Who likes 'em? NOBODY. 
But they are a fact of life. Everyone makes mistakes. Tracking them down is part of our lives as developers. This session will fill your tool kit with methods, ideas and techniques for finding and crushing bugs. 

This presentation is (mostly) not .Net and Visual Studio specific and would be a great fit for developers who work in any language.
