## Title: Using Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flows to load Data Vault
## Abstract:
### Data Flow as a data transformation engine has been introduced to the Microsoft Azure Data Factory (ADF) last year as a private feature preview. This privacy restriction has been lifted during the last Microsoft Build conference in 2019 and Data Flow feature has become a public preview component of the ADF.

There are many different use-case scenarios that can be covered by Data Flows, considering that Data Flows in SQL Integration Service (SSIS) projects are still playing a big role to fulfill Extracting-Loading-Transforming (ETL) patterns for your data.

In this session, I will share my experience of populating a Data Vault repository by using Data Flows in Azure Data Factory.
