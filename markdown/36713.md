## Title: Approaches to database Unit Testing
## Abstract:
### Database testing can be challenging, for a number of reasons that will be touched on in this session. 

We will discuss the motivations for unit testing, as well as some of the particular challenges involved in testing database code and integrating this testing into the software development process.

Over the years, a number of tools and approaches have been developed to address these difficulties, and we will draw comparisons between some of these in order to highlight the questions you need to consider in choosing a testing approach for your own projects.
