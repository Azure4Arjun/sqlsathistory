## Title: Building a data connector for Power BI
## Abstract:
### Do you want to access data from a REST API with Power BI? Willing to know more about data connectors and the Power Query M language? Welcome on board! This session will show you, with a real use-case, what’s a data connector and how to build it. Starting with the definition of a function, going through authorization and finally packaging the whole is a nice journey that we’ll follow during the next 60 minutes.
