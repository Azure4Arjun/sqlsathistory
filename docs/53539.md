Event Date: 10-12-2016 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Size Maters Not
## Abstract:
### What changes when either the workload or the database grows. Thomas designed build and operated the infrastructure of some of the most demanding workloads ever run on SQL Server. In this session he will share what needed to be done different and what surprising findings he made.
 
He will cover topics including but not limited to: handling a lot of transactions per second, managing large databases and tables with a lot of rows , inserting a lot of new data and updating a lot from many places at once, and managing many SQL Server instances.
 
The goal of the session is to show that SQL Server can scale and that when used correctly has no problem doing so.
