## Title: Infrastructure level In Memory Computing
## Abstract:
### I/O performance and operational ease of use are key requirements for SQL Server deployments. While virtualization has delivered operational ease of use it has done so at the expense of I/O performance. This has resulted in excessive database tuning or expensive and disruptive infrastructure changes to alleviate the I/O bottlenecks. Database level In-Memory Computing while promising brings with it a slew of challenges including application rewrites. 

What if one could guarantee In-Memory performance for SQL Server without any of the challenges that contemporary approaches incur? In this  presentation Bala Narasimhan will introduce 'Infrastructure level In Memory Computing' as a bullet proof way of providing RAM performance for SQL Server without any side effects, any application rewrites or changes to infrastructure.
