## Speaker: Joe Webb
## Title: Professional Development
## Abstract:
### Imagine trying to steer a car blindfolded. How about shooting a jump shot without being able to see the goal. It's not easy, is it? Yet, that's exactly what your team is doing if you are not providing clear and effective feedback about their work and behavior. 

In this session, you'll learn how to provide effective feedback to your peers and direct reports. You'll learn how to deliver feedback that encourages the behavior that you'd like to see repeated and provides recommended changes for behavior that is subpar or not acceptable. You'll also lean how to customize your feedback based on different personality types.
