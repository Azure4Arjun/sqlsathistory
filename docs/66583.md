## Speaker: Rory Bolle
## Title: What is a Database?
## Abstract:
### What is a database actually? What does SQL give you out of the box? How is data actually stored? What is a page, what is a log, what does 'Hardening to disk' actually mean? Are there only 4 commands in a database?

This session is designed to give a respectful nod to all the things you "Get for free" when working on a Database.
