Event Date: 06-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 384AB
## Speaker: Zach Mattson
## Title: A Powershell Driven Life
## Abstract:
### Why are we here?  I have no idea, but I do know Powershell can probably help make it easier.  This session will be entirely demos hitting on a variety of different areas in the SQL Server stack.  Using plenty of SQL Server Management Objects(SMO), we will cover a variety of tasks for the data professional on both sides (OLTP / OLAP) of the house including working with SSAS, SQL Server , writing tests and automation.  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.  A Powerpoint free presentation.
