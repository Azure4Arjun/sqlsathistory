## Speaker: David Bermingham
## Title: Everything you were afraid to ask about cluster quorums, explained
## Abstract:
### In this deep dive Cluster MVP Dave Bermingham will take a look at cluster quorum options and how they have evolved over the years. Starting with Disk only quorums and ending with Cloud Witness, by the end of this session you should understand this most commonly misunderstood cluster concept and be ready to tackle your next AlwaysOn Availability Groups deployment or AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instance implementation. Multisite and SANLess clusters will be discussed as well as the implications of Dynamic Quorum and Dynamic Witness.
