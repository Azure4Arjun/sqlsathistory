## Speaker: Alexander Nykolaiszyn
## Title: A Matter of Time... In SSAS
## Abstract:
### Ever as yourself what time of day it is? Like what time of day does our support desk get the most cases? What are my average sales per hour? When do I need to add more staff, or even perhaps am I over staffed? There are many situations in which being able to slice your data by time of day would be valuable. In this session we will review how to setup a time key and time dimension, configure it in an OLAP cube, and discuss implementing in a tablular model.
