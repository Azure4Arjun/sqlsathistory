## Title: Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
## Abstract:
### You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used. 

PreReqs: This session only requires you to have a basic knowledge of SQL Server configuration and an interest in protecting the data in your database.

Goal 1: Learn what is exposed when using the default, unprotected connections to SQL Server
Goal 2: Learn how to configure SQL Serve to use an SSL certificate t
