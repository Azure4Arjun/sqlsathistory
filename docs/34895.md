## Title: Getting to Step 1: Automatic Installation of Big Data, Cloud, Web and HPC Cluster 
## Abstract:
### Abstract: Every major big data, cloud and HPC application vendors's documentation says the same thing: "First install a cluster..." It turns out "first install a cluster," or Step 0, is a harder problem than most people expect or consider at the beginning of a big data or cloud project. Getting a consistently configured OS and applications on sometimes heterogeneous hardware can be a tedious long drawn out affair, even with Devops tools. StackIQ Rocks is based on the HPC Open Source Rocks project. It has been adapted to deploy large scale big data systems as it does for large scale HPC systems. Stackiq Rocks enables a fast efficient deployment of the entire or partial big data or cloud stack of software for RedHat variants.
