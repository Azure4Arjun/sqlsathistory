## Title: Predicting demonic possession using AzureML
## Abstract:
### Performing exorcisms is a very difficult and time-consuming process. It isn’t always directly clear whether a person is truly possessed by an evil spirit or if we are dealing with a false-positive. What if we can accurately predict if someone is actually possessed before we start the exorcism? This can help us avoid spending valuable resources, like holy water, and avoids possible lawsuits if it turns out an exorcism wasn’t necessary.
In this very special session, created specifically for the six-hundredth-and-sixty-six edition of SQLSaturday, we will use the power of Azure Machine Learning to find out if we can predict demonic possession and bring the worlds of data science and exorcisms closer together!
We will go through all the steps for building a reliably machine learning model together. From analyzing the data to optimizing the model to increase the prediction accuracy. The end result? A machine learning prediction model that will help identify possible possession victims!
