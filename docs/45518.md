## Speaker: Sean Werick
## Title: Tired of looking for query performance optimizations?  Try the Query Store!
## Abstract:
### This session will discuss the fantastic new capabilities of Query Store with SQL Server 2016.  It will illustrate what it is, why we want it, how we would use it, and how it is BETTER than any other available performance tuning tools.  This session will walk through enabling this feature, leveraging its capabilities, and modifying some of the available options.  If attendees walk away with nothing else from this session, remember the LIVE Query Statistics (or Execution Plan).  This is a game changer and will greatly impact any on-demand query optimization.
