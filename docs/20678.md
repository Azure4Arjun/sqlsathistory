## Speaker: Mike Diehl
## Title: Coupling and Cohesion Patterns and Anti-Patterns in SQL and ETL development
## Abstract:
### Frequently I encounter SQL servers and databases in enterprises with huge interdependency issues, such as linked servers, cross-database views and stored procedures, and complicated ETL packages. In this session I will show the most grievous bad practices, what sorts of problems and constrictions they cause, and how they can be re-written to achieve much looser coupling across all data in an enterprise. Any DBA or developer that uses more than two part table or view names in their queries or stored procedures should attend!
