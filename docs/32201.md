## Title: Data to Dashboards:Back to Basics 
## Abstract:
### Is Business Intelligence a critical strategy within your organization?  Companies that have a depth of analytic support, that use it across their entire organization, and value the insights they gain from their analytic solutions—these are companies far more likely to be high corporate performers.  And as such, availability of analytics across the enterprise, and the USE of those analytics—this can drive competitive differentiation for an organization.  In this session, we will move past the technology and discuss the value of focusing on some very basic, but very critical components to be considered when developing your Business Intelligence strategy.
