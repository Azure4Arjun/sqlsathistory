#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA I
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Manage SQL Server 2012 with PowerShell and Core
## Abstract:
### Windows Server 2008 introduced Server Core, the operating system without the Graphical User Interface. SQL Server 2012 is the first version of SQL Server to support Server Core. To gain the maximum efficiency from your servers you want to make use of Server Core and with PowerShell you can effectively manage SQL Server in that environment. This session will demonstrate how to manage SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server Core and provide scripts to help you perform the common tasks you need to perform on that platform.

## Speaker: Bill Wolff
## Title: SharePoint Integration with SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### SharePoint is a collaboration, document management, and solution delivery platform built on .NET, SQL Server, and Active Directory. This talk explains how SharePoint uses SQL Server to store content, configuration, and logging data. For databases that are not native to SharePoint, Business Connectivity Services provides a seamless forms over data experience. SharePoint is used extensively for Business Intelligence where it becomes the user interface for Reporting Services, PowerPivot, and Performance Point. We will also look at how SQL Server 2012 affects the SharePoint ecosystem.

# What's Buried in the Plan Cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: What's Buried in the Plan Cache?
## Abstract:
### Creating a query plan can be a time consuming and expensive process. To avoid repeating these potentially costly steps unnecessarily, SQL Server stores its query plans, in the plan cache where they can be reused as needed.
 
In this session, we’ll look at how the plan cache is organized, what plans are saved, when plans are reused and when they are recreated, methods for observing the contents of the plan cache, and finally, methods for manipulating plan reuse and recreation.

# Working with Server Side Traces
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA\Dev
## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: Working with Server Side Traces
## Abstract:
### You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.

# Thwarting Database Defects
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Dennis Lloyd Jr
## Title: Thwarting Database Defects
## Abstract:
### It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them. This presentation introduces tSQLt, a framework for automated database unit testing. You’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain.

# DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA I
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous
## Abstract:
### There are many DBCC statements at the disposal of Database Administrators and Developers. Some are used for the greater good; others can wreak havoc in your system. The majority of these commands are informational, but if you’re not careful you can introduce chaos or at worst, lose data you may never find again. In this session we will explore DBCC commands that are useful for the DBA and developer, and cover when to use them and how. Expect demonstrations that provide a practical application of these commands - both documented and not - that database professionals can utilize quickly and easily.

# You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#121-Philadelphia-2012)
Event Date: 09-06-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA\Dev
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query. If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

## Title: Avoiding "Monkey At The Monitor" By Delegating
## Abstract:
### As a DBA there is a lot of simple, step-by-step work that has to be completed on a daily basis. And while it's obviously a necessary part of our job, it's not fun and it takes away from time we could spend doing more important, less urgent work. One attractive option is delegating work to others, thus allowing the DBA to focus on more attractive / important tasks. But how do we do so without compromising security or best practices? Using the tips and tricks presented in this session, you'll be able to spread your workload to junior personnel while still maintaining a sound security / audit model.

## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine. To use the new Vertipaq engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to query the data, create calculations, measures, and KPI’s.This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded). We will import data from a SQL Server relational database into a tabular model project and create relationships between the tables. We will use DAX to create and manage calculations, measures, and Key Performance Indicators
