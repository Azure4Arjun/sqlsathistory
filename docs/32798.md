## Title: Shortest Path Problem at DisneyLand
## Abstract:
### We have all been on a vacation.  Our thoughts sometimes are to get to the rides quickly so that we can hit each one and get through the park without missing anything.  

This talk will be on given a list of points (Attractions) and their pairwise distances, the task is to find a shortest possible tour that visits each point (Attractions) exactly once. We will be discussing Dkjkstra's routing algorithm to solve the problem using T-SQL.
