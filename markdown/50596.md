## Title: The HA Blueprint for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server allow applications to achieve high availability (HA) like never before, thanks to synchronous replication technology in AlwaysOn. This capability enables applications to use more resources on more servers, which can significantly improve scalability, performance, and resiliency. But to gain the full value of the SQL Server architecture, you are required to make code modifications at the application or database layers.  Deploying database load balancing software is an elegant way to gain enterprise-grade HA without code changes. In this SQL Saturday talk, ScaleArc will provide a blueprint for achieving HA with SQL Server.
