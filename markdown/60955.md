## Title: Are you down with MPP? - Part 2 - SQL Based Solutions
## Abstract:
### Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures allow the use of large numbers of processors (or computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously.  MPP architectures can help with the processing and aggregation of large volumes of data with varying shapes, but can be complicated and costly to deploy and maintain.  We'll explore using the Microsoft Azure cloud as a platform for quickly creating cost-effective MPP solutions.  We will use Microsoft Azure to deploy and process data with a SQL based MMP architecture (Azure SQL Data Warehouse).  The pros and cons of SQL based MPP will be discussed, as well as when a company might choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering over an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution.  This talk will be packed full of demos and real-world learnings.
