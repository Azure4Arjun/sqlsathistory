## Title: A Database Designer's Favorite Features in SQL Server: Security, Privacy, and More
## Abstract:
### With the perfect storm of new compliance legislation and greater coverage of data breaches, data protection becomes a higher priority for organizations.  In this session, Karen will be discussing the SQL Server features from a database designers point of view, including:
- Dynamic Data Masking
- Always Encrypted
- Row Level Security
- Azure services
- Deprecated Features
- Data Type Selection

We'll look at the features, why you should consider them, where they work, where they don't, who needs to be involved in using them, and what changes, if any, need to be made to applications or tools that you use with SQL Server.
