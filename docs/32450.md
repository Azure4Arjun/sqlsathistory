## Title: Service Broker...What's That  How Do I Use It?
## Abstract:
### Have you heard of Service Broker? Do you know what it is? How about how to use it? This session will answer these questions and more. Service Broker is arguably one of the least known and used features of SQL Server. We'll explore Service Broker and learn what it is and how it works. We'll walk through the setup and configuration along with demonstrating its use. You'll leave this session with a better understanding of Service Broker, its use and implementation, along with ideas of how you can implement it in your own environments.
