## Speaker: Iain Elder
## Title: Web Scraping with Python - scraping the web, without the sting
## Abstract:
### Need to download data from a website without an API? Scrape it!
 
Web scraping is a technique for collecting information from websites, especially in ways not intended by the publisher.
 
Many business have web scraping in their data strategy to open up new business opportunities and remain competitive. It is something that we can all use to make existing data acquisition tasks easier and make new goals possible.

Python is well suited to the task of web data acquisition. Thanks to its simple, clean syntax and interactive shell, it is easy and fun to learn. It is accessible to Business Intelligence professionals with an SQL background.

Scrapy provides an infrastructure for writing scraping programs called spiders. It allows you to achieve more with shorter, more declarative code. It can be used for small and large scraping projects.

In our demo we will study the anatomy of a spider, then use it pull data from a website into Microsoft SQL Server for further analysis.

## Title: Business Analytics 101 Jumpstart using Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Business analytics platforms have always been tools built for statisticians and data scientists. However, these tools are increasingly being directed at business analysts, and Gartner's rankings on its well-known "completeness of vision" and "ability to execute" axes now ride as much on "ease of use" as they do on offering advanced analytical algorithms.
How does this change in landscape affect businesses? Are you new to the world of business analytics? Are you taking over an existing analytics program, or starting one from scratch? This session will help you to understand how to craft a strategy, provision the right  business analytical capabilities, and move towards actionable results. We’ll identify common pitfalls to avoid as you start or reinvigorate your business analytics program. In particular, we’ll explore how companies are using self-service and data discovery techniques to deliver more agile analytics using Azure Machine Learning.

# Better Data Visualisation for CRM and ERP

### Come and learn best practices for designing charts to help people understand their business data effortlessly.
Need to create charts and dashboards for people to get insight from their complex data and make better business decisions? This session will show you what to do, and more importantly why. Understand the way our brains are wired and take advantage of our ability to process some types of visual data far more easily than others. You will learn some great tips for better visualisation, and common pitfalls to avoid, rather than the technical ins-and-outs of how to achieve this with a specific piece of software. The main focus will be on charts and dashboards for CRM or ERP systems, but the approaches are just as valid using Excel, PowerPivot, SSRS or big analytics products from any data source.

# The European Economic Crisis and the Euro-A Data Tale
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#388---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2015)
Event Date: 13-06-2015 - Session time: 16:45:00 - Track: Business Analytics Track
## Speaker: Carmel Gunn
## Title: The European Economic Crisis and the Euro-A Data Tale
## Abstract:
### Investigative exploration of data is very often ad-hoc in nature. We might need to interact with many types and soures of data. The Questions we need to ask, and the data we might need to answer them are not set in stone, and as a result following traditional modelling is not always an option. Rather, we follow the data, to an unknown end.

In this session, we take the European Economic Crisis, and the Euro, and see what publically available data can do to give us insights into one of the largest currencies in the world.

# Customising the Excel Ribbon
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#388---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2015)

## Speaker: Bob Phillips
## Title: Customising the Excel Ribbon
## Abstract:
### All applications need some method for the user to interact with. Excel built-in functionality is accessed via the Ribbon, and Excel provides the capability to customise the Ribbon to organise it to your preference. More interestingly, it is possible to create your own Ribbon tabs that can interact with your applications.

This session will briefly show how to add items to the QAT and personalise the existing Ribbon, and then we will develop a Ribbon to manage a number of VBA macros, demonstrating dynamic Ribbon capabilities such as changing the image, and adding/removing items to/from dropdowns and dynamic menus. It will also show how to develop this code for 32 and 64 bit environments, and protect the ribbon from context loss.

## Speaker: Gary Short - C# MVP
## Title: Troll Hunting on the Internet
## Abstract:
### The phenomenon of anonymous cyber bullies trolling individuals, as a pack, has increased over the years. One of the things that makes this appealing for the trolls is that they feel that they can act with impunity due to the anonymity provided by many social networks.
In this presentation we'll walk through the development of a theoretical application to identify these trolls, and the multiple accounts they hold, via computational lingustics, before using predictive analytics to suggest likely locations for their homes and places of work/education.
By removing the anonymity of the Internet we can drive these trolls off of social media.
