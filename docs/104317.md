## Title: Datacenter and/or Cloud - When to Use One, the Other, or Both
## Abstract:
### As with all other items in your toolbox the datacenter (local or in the cloud) needs to be used correctly. 

This session will show the various types and sizes of workloads, show you how to categorize them, look at the requirements of your SLA (Service Level Agreement), and find the right location (cloud, datacenter, hybrid) for the data. To wrap things up, we look at ways to validate that the SLA can be fulfilled and how to estimate and compare the costs.
