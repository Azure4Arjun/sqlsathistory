## Title: Apply the Power of Azure Data Lake Analytics to Your BI Landscape [DE]
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA) is a new service from Microsoft for Analytics on Big Data Workload. U-SQL as a query language offers extraordinary query and transformation power by combining C# and SQL together. Nice! But: How do you integrate this service into your existing BI workload? 

In this session you will learn how to integrate relational databases (SQL Azure DB, Azure DWH, or SQL Server) by federation with ADLA, how to trigger jobs from on-prem systems like SSIS, and how to orchestrate the service via Azure Data Factory. Through live demos you will see that this service gives you great computing power for your BI landscape and integration is not that difficult.
