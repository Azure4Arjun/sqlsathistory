## Title: Eliminating the CRUD with Entity Framework Core
## Abstract:
### Developers need to insert and query data stored in databases, but never want to enter the land of building SQL stored procedures for everything. I want to give an approach to CRUD without caring about the underlying database container. We're .NET Developers, we like to write structures in a way that makes sense to us. In this case, Entity Framework Core is a brilliant option that layers on top of MySQL, Postgres SQL, and MS SQL, to name a few.
