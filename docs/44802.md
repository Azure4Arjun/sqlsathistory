## Title: Be a Role Model for Women in Tech through Blogging
## Abstract:
### Have you wanted to start giving back to our amazing SQL Community through writing, but are not sure how to start? Do you want to start blogging, but are anxious about criticisms? Are you unsure what to write about? I’ll walk through how to find topics to start writing about. I’ll go over tools to help you blog, and websites that you can start blogging about. We’ll discuss why it’s import to be a woman blogger, and I’ll share with you my experience over the last three years as a woman blogger in our community. Role models are needed for women in tech. They need to know that they are wanted in the community and that they have a voice. Be that role model through blogging.
