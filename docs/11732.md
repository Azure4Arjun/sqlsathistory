## Title: Optimizing your BI Semantic Model for Power View
## Abstract:
### Power View is the new ad-hoc data visualization tool coming in SQL Server 2012. Power View runs on a Business Intelligence Semantic Model created in either PowerPivot for Excel, or in Visual Studio 2010 for publishing to SQL Server Analysis Services. In this session we will go through the complete process for creating several (BISM) models from scratch, and working up in complexity using the Data Analysis Expresssion Language (DAX) to provide a functional and usable experience for your end-users that will use Power View.
