## Title: Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### You have been working with SQL Server for several years and you feel quite comfortable with most of the available features. Even you have a checklist for installation/configuration of SQL Server to be compliant with corporate standards. However, somewhere on the back of the head you have a feeling that there is something more that can be done to secure your SQL Server. If you are willing to see how small reconfiguration can lead to compromise of your SQL Server join this session. There will be demos on live system showing how to leverage misconfiguration and how to prevent them from happening in the future. After the session you will have a set of checks that can be implemented on your system.
