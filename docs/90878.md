## Title: Backing up to Azure BLOB Storage
## Abstract:
### As a DBA, you know the importance of having off-site database backups (in case of disaster in your data centers). Historically, the logistics for off-site database backups have been complex and expensive. Backing up to the cloud brought simplification and an economical option. In this session, we will introduce the functionality that is built-in to SQL Server for backing a database up to the Azure Cloud ("Backup to URL"). We will discuss some concepts around Azure BLOB storage, explain the process of configuring backups, and then discuss troubleshooting issues with Backup to URL.
