## Title: Protecting Distributed and Legacy SQL-based Applications
## Abstract:
### Encryptionizer for SQL Server is a cost-effective alternative to upgrading to SQL Enterprise for TDE. Encryptionizer works with all versions and editions of SQL Server from Express to Enterprise.  It is deployed by a simple point-and-click interface.
However, what if you are, say, a commercial developer or device manufacturer with hundreds or even thousands of customers who need to come into compliance? You obviously don't want to do a point-and-click deployment on each one. This session will show how you can use Encryptionizer's script-based deployment to install on one or ten thousand machines (even Legacy machines) with no programming and no user interaction.
