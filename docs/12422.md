## Speaker: David McMahon
## Title: SharePoint HA and DR
## Abstract:
### When it comes to SharePoint High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are often merged and confused. In this session we'll take a look at the various HA tools that are available to you  when configuring a SharePoint Farm. We'll look at this from a SQL perspective and from a SharePoint perspective and consider what the implications are when applying patches and deploying customisations to a SharePoint Farm for HA and DR. We'll consider some HA and DR scenarios for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 and take a look at the use of SQL Always On as it relates to SharePoint.
