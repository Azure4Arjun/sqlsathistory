## Title: Whatâ€™s new in DAX 2015
## Abstract:
### Power BI Designer is the first tool that introduced new features in DAX, which will be available in future versions of Analysis Services and Power Pivot for Excel. In this session, you will see the new DAX functions introduced in 2015. You will learn new aggregation and statistical functions, new ways to filter and manipulate tables, and new optimized techniques to query data with a table expression. These new functions, plus updates in DAX syntax, makes DAX easier to read and improve its performance, too.
