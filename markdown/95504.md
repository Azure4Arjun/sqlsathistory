## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Developing Your First Presentation
## Abstract:
### Ever considered giving a presentation of your own? Pondered how your favorite speakers got their start? Contemplated whether you could ever do that too, but were not sure where to begin?

In this session I will show you how to get started. We will go over how to develop your idea, create session content, and share my favorite tips  tricks. 

You will leave armed with a wealth of resources (and hopefully some inspiration) to venture forth and develop your first presentation.
