## Title: Life of a Lead DBA - How to explain to your boss 'what you do'
## Abstract:
### When you are a lead Database Administrator, you can almost be guaranteed that your boss will not know more about databases then you do.  

It will be your job to explain to your boss (customers, clients, etc.) what it takes to operate and maintain a well-running database environment.  You have to justify why there is work and spending necessary for *reactive* support and maintenance.  No organization can stand still, so you will also need to demonstrate the need for *proactive* work: research, training and planning for new architecture.  By doing so, you can demonstrate the value you are adding as a Lead DBA.

In this session, you will see some frameworks and templates for explaining your responsibilities to your boss.   Get some ideas reporting your workload in business terms, and presenting your database environment and concepts to non-technical audiences.
