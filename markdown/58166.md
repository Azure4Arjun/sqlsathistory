## Speaker: Erik Svensen
## Title: Power Query - Don't be afraid of the advanced editor
## Abstract:
### There is no reason to be afraid of the advanced editor in Power Query - you can do a lot more in here than the user interface exposes.

I will guide you through different examples of hidden functions and variables you can use in your data extraction and transformations using Power Query, and you will learn how to make your queries dynamic and flexible and even include error handling if something you didnt expect happen actually do.

You will leave the session with a good understanding of how powerful the language of Power Query actually is and how you can use it in your toolbelt.

The learnings can be used both in Power BI Desktop and Excel.
