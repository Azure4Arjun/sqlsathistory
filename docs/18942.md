## Title: Fundamentals of MDX
## Abstract:
### Cubes and Excel go together like peanut butter and jelly. However, some questions cannot be answered by browsing a cube. Multidimensional Expressions, or MDX, unlock the full potential of your multidimensional data. Learning MDX requires a clear understanding of some fundamental concepts. Change your mental model, and advance past the MDX learning curve.
