## Title: A Closer Look at Distributed Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduces a new way of deploying an availability group: Distributed Availability Groups. This new form of an AG allows you to span different underlying Windows Server Cluster topologies which can enable both disaster recovery and migration scenarios. This session will cover how Distributed Availability Groups work, how you need to think about them in a possible deployment scenario, as well as show a demo of one in action.
