# An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2017
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#897---Cape-Town-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.

## Speaker: Arohan Naidoo
## Title: Get your head start on IoT with Azure IoT Hub and stream Analytics to Power Bi
## Abstract:
### This session will focusing on providing a  SQL/BI developer with the basics to rapidly getting started working with data generated from Internet of Things(IoT) devices using  Windows 10 IoT core running on a Raspberry Pi as an IoT source collect data and send data to Azure IoT hub. Some of the aspects that will be looked at is getting the development environment setup, getting Windows 10 IoT core running on a Raspberry Pi , connecting IoT device to Azure and the challenges faced, then we will move on to getting an app running that sends data to IoT hub and visualizing this data in Power BI

# Web Scraping
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#897---Cape-Town-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Orange 
## Speaker: Andrew Collier
## Title: Web Scraping
## Abstract:
### Often the data you want is available somewhere on the internet. It might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across many pages (possibly hundreds or thousands of pages!). But you want those data consolidated locally in a convenient format.

What would Ragnar do? He'd go out, grab the data and bring it home.

The contemporary Internet Viking uses Web Scraping to systematically extract information from web pages. This is the battle plan:

- Sharpening the Axe: Understanding of the structure of an HTML document.
- Preparing the Longships: Using the DOM to select elements.
- Doing Battle: Manual scraping.
- Stashing the Treasure: Storing data.
- The Journey Home: Automated scraping with Scrapy.
- Triumphant Return: Driving a browser using Selenium.

By the end of the tutorial you'll be ready to pillage and plunder large swathes of the internet.

Come along and make Ragnar proud.

This tutorial will be suitable for Vikings with low to moderate levels of Python experience.

### So you've built a flashy new Data Warehouse and deployed it to production. 

Great now what?

Nobody wants to be involved with a project that is constantly failing and difficult to support.
This session will take a look at some design considerations and tips to ensure that your mart runs with minimal intervention and is easy to support.

The tools discussed and used in the examples will be SSIS and SQL server but many of the points discussed are valid for all tools.

Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Orange 
## Speaker: James McGillivray
## Title: Design Strategies and Advanced Data Visualization: The Ingredients for a Delicious Data Story
## Abstract:
### You’re comfortable with picking the right visualization for a specific data set, and making it look good. You know the basics of design and can craft a report that is pleasing on the eye. Now it’s time to take your data presentation skills to the next level.

In this session, we will learn how to design for accessibility, allowing more people to benefit from our work. We’ll learn the difference between designing for users to explore information, and for users to consume insights. This will lead us into the basics of constructing a data story. From choosing the relevant data points, to removing all unnecessary distractions and constructing a cohesive narrative.

Every data story is unique, but the techniques for effective data presentation are universal. Improve your reports, dashboards, and slide decks by learning the art and science of quality data visualization.

This session will help you understand why choosing the correct data type for your data is so important.  It affects data quality, storage and performance.  It can even produce incorrect query results.

## Title: Functions - the good, the bad and the really, really ugly.
## Abstract:
### Scalar functions have a bad reputation in SQL Server, and for good reason. In this presentation I’m going to show the problems that scalar functions cause, in terms of performance and why they’re so hard to see in many cases.

I’ll show you how to replace simple scalar functions with an in-line table-valued function that performs far better. We’ll also look at the improvements to functions in sql server 2019.

# Learn from the Product Group - Azure SQL DB: Hyperscale
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#897---Cape-Town-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Alain Dormehl
## Title: Learn from the Product Group - Azure SQL DB: Hyperscale
## Abstract:
### This session will be presented by the Microsoft Azure SQL Database Product Group and will cover a deep dive into the architecture for Azure SQL Database Hyperscale. 

The database-as-a-service paradigm in the cloud (DBaaS) is becoming increasingly popular. Organizations adopt this paradigm because they expect higher security, higher availability, and lower and more flexible cost with high performance. It has become clear, however, that these expectations
cannot be met in the cloud with the traditional, monolithic database architecture. This paper presents a novel DBaaS architecture, called Hyperscale.  This session will cover the key ideas and features
of Hyperscale, as well as comparing it to traditional deployment options.

## Speaker: Jean-Pierre Voogt
## Title: Working with data in Python for Beginners
## Abstract:
### Data Science is the latest Data Buzz word, but what does this mean for us the Analysts and Developers. Well, this is just another opportunity to grow and learn a new skill. The great thing about the era we live in is that information is everywhere but can be a little overwhelming for someone who is just starting off in a new field or wants to learn a new skill.

In this session, we will use Python in an easy to understand layout by using Notebooks as our Interface and pandas as our data manipulation library in Python. This session is for everyone that is just starting off in Python. We will learn how to import/export data into Python as well as manipulate and analyse data. Finally, we will look at how to bring this back into our SQL Server world.
