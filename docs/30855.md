## Title: I have been converted. Will you?
## Abstract:
### I am a database developer/dba like you and love using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) just like you.  But, since using the Visual Studio Database Edition tools, I am now a convert.  Visual Studio 2010 is the most recent released version of the database toolset and continues to greatly improve things providing database developers with the great tools that other developers have had for years.  We will cover deploying databases from VS 2010, Configuration Manager, handling Reference data, Pre  Post Deployment scripts, and touch on refactoring.   Come be converted =).
