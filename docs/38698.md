## Title: Deep Dive into In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)
## Abstract:
### For those who already have a basic understanding of Hekaton this session takes a deeper look; the session focus will be: Row Chains and MVCC, Hash and Range index internals and when and how to use. We will cover how to diagnose and deal with issues (through DMVâ€™s and Perfmon). Hekaton basics are assumed.
