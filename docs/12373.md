## Title: T-SQL: Simple Changes That Go a Long Way
## Abstract:
### Writing TSQL that performs well requires knowledge beyond proper syntax, sometimes it requires more than just knowing TSQL, and sometimes it takes a bit of rework and ingenuity. There are simple things that you will learn in this session that will improve the performance of your queries. Learn about indexing techniques and reading execution plans to see if the optimizer is using the index. Performance isn't everything though. There are small things you can do to make your TSQL more maintainable too. We will dive into a few TSQL tricks with Common Table Expressions, Table-Valued Parameters, and COALESCE.
