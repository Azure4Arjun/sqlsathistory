## Title: Real-time analytics with Azure Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### In today's fast-paced world, businesses require up to the minute information to support critical decisions. Traditional business intelligence solutions, however, are not able to keep up with this demand and a new approach is required. Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time event processing engine capable of analysing millions of events every second. During the session, you will learn key concepts needed when working with streaming data in Azure before stepping through an end-to-end streaming data demonstration integrating Azure Event Hubs and Power BI.
