## Title: A Look At SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### A deep-dive into what is sure to become a very critical feature of SQL Server 2016. We'll walk through some use-cases for the technology, and discuss why this kind of technology is needed - and how it can make a DBA's life easier - including making some regulatory compliance easier. We'll then walk though a typical implementation scenario live, and walk though a few demos and practical examples.
