## Title: Making Life Easy With PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Do you like making things easy for yourself? Are you a database professional who has yet to feel comfortable with PowerShell? Then this session is for you. 
In this demo heavy session I will go over how a DBA can use PowerShell to make life easier when dealing with common, and not so common, issues and tasks. I will show you real world examples of how PowerShell and SQL Server work together, like peanut butter and jelly, to help you solve problems. We'll go on a magical journey from brief overview and simple scripts to advanced functions and modules. Leveraging the power of PowerShell we'll iterate over instances, audit servers, migrate instances, manipulate SSRS subscriptions and much more.
