## Title: SQL Server 2016 SP1 ROCKS!!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 SP1 is probably one of the top 3 announcements for SQL Server ... EVER!! Many previously Enterprise Edition only features were opened up to lower SKUs, including SQL Express! Memory usage scenarios changed DRASTICALLY too! This session will be a medium-to-high-level overview of these absolutely incredible changes.  If you are like most entities and NOT on SQL Server Enterprise Edition you WILL want to be on SQL Server 2016 SP1 after hearing this talk!
