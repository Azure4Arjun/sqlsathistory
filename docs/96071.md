## Title: Docker for data amateur
## Abstract:
### Even tough it's nothing new, Docker is a thing nowadays. I've decided to check containers out as well and learn how they can help me. Although I'm a BI consultant and not really using Docker and containers in the current projects, I've already found them to be very helpful on my daily basis learning and other activities. If you are also passionate about data and still experimenting with SQL Server and/or Python and/or any other technology, please join the session and see how Docker can change your life. 
I will show you my journey, my thoughts and my findings regarding the usage of SQL Server and Python together with Docker. And there will be a lot, a lot of demos.
