## Speaker: Michael Sexton
## Title: An Introduction to Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### The “Gold” record.  The “master maintainable list”.  

There is so much data in so many systems that businesses may have no way of telling which record is accurate and up to date.  Even if a given record is accurate, how do we correct the inaccurate records in other systems?  The dissonance between these systems costs businesses time and money and can lead to poor customer relations.

Master Data Services (MDS) provides tools to get all of your databases singing from the same sheet of music.  This hour will include an overview of key master data management concepts, an introduction to MDS and how that fits in a data quality strategy and demonstrations integrating MDS systems using SSIS.
