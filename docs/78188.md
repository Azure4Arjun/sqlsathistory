## Title: SQLOpsStudio Vs SSMS - There can be only one
## Abstract:
### SQLOpsStudio is the new kid in town for the data professional. Is it a replacement for good old SSMS? 
In this session we will take you on a journey of comparing SSMS and SQLOpsStudio so that you can understand the ins and outs of both these tools, making it easier to know what each brings to the table. In this demo heavy session we not only hear about the differences but we match them up against each other to better learn what each can do.
