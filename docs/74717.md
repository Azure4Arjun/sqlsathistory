## Title: Automation and best practices for ADFv2
## Abstract:
### A lot of new functionality and features have been introduced with Azure Data Factory. Using regular SSIS packages you have great flexibility using BIML.

As part of this session we will be looking into the automation functionality for ADFv2 and how you get started with data extraction and best practices using PowerShell for automation.

We will as well look into how this fits perfectly with Azure Logic apps for automation.
