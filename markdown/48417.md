## Speaker: Lynsey Gwin
## Title: User Experience: Empathy for our users (and teammates)
## Abstract:
### At the core of User Experience is Empathy. The ability to be empathetic to your end user can be deceptively challenging. Just because something works does not always mean it is the best and easiest functionality to serve to your audience. In this session, we will review some common areas of practice in the User Experience process to get into the mind of your target user and make design and development decisions based on empathy. As an added bonus, we will also discuss how to achieve empathy for the product team around you in order to build the best possible solution for your client together.
