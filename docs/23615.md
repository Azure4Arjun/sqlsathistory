## Title: Automating SQL Server Administration
## Abstract:
### This session will describe some time-tested techniques that we employ here at the University of Iowa to automate the administration of our 100+ SQL Server instances. I will describe the creation of a DBA utility database, the proper setup and configuration of SQL Server Agent features (operators, database mail, jobs and alerts), and the creation of SQL Server Agent jobs that perform maintenance tasks requiring little human intervention. I will also explain how to create a SQL Server central management server to manage multiple instances from a single SSMS query window.
