## Title: Transaction Log Internals and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll go through the internals of SQL Server transaction log, its logical and physical architecture and the internal processes of transaction logging. You'll see how poorly managed transaction log can negatively impact the overall performance of database server.
We examine the common issues such as full transaction log, how to get rid of multiple log files and shrink the log file, and solve the log fragmentation problem. Also we take a glance at new features of SQL Server 2014 for transaction log management.
