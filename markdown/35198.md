## Speaker: Jim Blizzard
## Title: Intro to VSTS DB
## Abstract:
### In this session we’ll take a lap around Visual Studio Team System for DB Pros to see how it can help you sleep better at night. Ever make a bunch of changes to your database then lose track of what you’ve changed?     Frustrated with trying to come up with consistent, “meaningful” test data to test your applications? Wish you could unit test your database?  Ever forget to make a backup copy of your stored procedure before you made that one line change (that happens to crash the system)? Tired of feeling like you’re not part of the team? Come see how VSTS DB can solve your problems!
