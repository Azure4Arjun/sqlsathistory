## Title: Is your Flight on Time? – Power BI Dashboard
## Abstract:
### It’s easy to find useful data on the Internet, model the data and construct a BI Dashboard using Power BI Desktop.  The application used in this session shows on-time performance of domestic flights.
Using government data this is available, you can answer these questions:
1.	Which airlines have the best on-time performance?
2.	Which flights between airports are regularly on-time?
3.	What day of the week or month is best to fly to get there on time?
4.	Which airline has the most cancelations?
This session covers how to build, model, and deploy a Power BI Dashboard to PowerBI.com that reads flight data and displays aircraft flights on-time performance.  The session also shows how to use Power Query to get data from the web.  
Finally, see the Dashboard in action and also how to use QA, a natural-language search technology.  Also, see Quick “Data” Insights, which uses Cortana Analytics in the background to show additional insights and analysis using the existing data model.
