## Title: Revealing the many Azure ML development and release processes
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning in Azure ML incorporates a number of different products which can be used to to create and implement a Machine Learning solution. Which product do you want to use, when? Which is the appropriate tool for integrating with SQL Server or data in Azure? 
AML Studio, Workspace and Pipelines are different products which you can use to create or deploy a solution and they all start with AML. Understanding the differences between these products provides the information needed to be able to architect the appropriate solution in your environment. These session demos show how to create an end-to-end AML workflow to prepare data, create ML models, deploy models, and use data contained within SQL Server by integrating a number of tools including Databricks, Python, and Jupyter notebooks. Learn why you want to use AML Workspace for ML development collaboration, scaling, and management.
