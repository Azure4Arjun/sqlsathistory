## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Free Tools to Expand Your SQL Knowledge
## Abstract:
### Do you work by yourself each day and wonder what other SQL Server DBA's are doing?  

Have you ever come across a question and wished that you could ask a Microsoft employee or MVP but didn't know how?

Do you read SQL Server Magazine every month and find yourself thinking, there must be more information out there?  

Do you hear people talk about tweets and blogs and wonder what they're talking about, or stick your nose in the air and think - "that's not important"?

Let me show you how useful the various online knowledge and social networking tools can be to the beginner as well as to the expert DBA.
