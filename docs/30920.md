## Title: Load-balancing architectures for Online Reporting 
## Abstract:
### We will describe some of the different architectures (focusing on the db side) that Microsoft Adserving has used to Load Balance ever growing user reporting loads, data refreshes, and database maintenance across multiple reporting servers.  The focus will be on the DB side, with minor context given to the web and middle tier pieces necessary for each system to work.  Note that this is reporting in the sense of generating end user reports (not using SSRS).
