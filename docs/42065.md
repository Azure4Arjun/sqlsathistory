## Title: The Art and the Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server Solution
## Abstract:
### When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way youâ€™ll hear best practices, tips, and real world advice for features like Availability Groups, clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will make you the hero of your next mission critical deployment.
