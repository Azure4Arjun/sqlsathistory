## Title: Upgrading SQL Server - Prepare for Success!
## Abstract:
### It's (past) time to upgrade your SQL Server(s)! Where do you start? What version should you pick? How do you migrate? What about the downtime? ARGH!

Come to this session and take the stress out of your SQL Server upgrade project. In this session, we'll walk through all you need to think about and do before, during, and after your upgrade for success.  We'll answer your upgrade questions, but you'll also leave with the right questions to ask everyone else as you prepare for a successful SQL Server upgrade project.

We'll talk about successful upgrade checklists, best practices, why roulette is better than in-place upgrades, and how to minimize the strain on your users and teams during the upgrade. You'll leave with a working start on your upgrade checklist and plans, too!

Come on! Ditch those SQL Server 2008, 2012, and 2014 instances! Also, yes, we'll chat about the cloud some, too.
