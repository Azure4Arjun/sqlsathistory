## Title: Collecting Baseline Metrics
## Abstract:
### How do you know when your server is on fire?  Without a set known-good measurements to compare against to look at you donâ€™t.  This session will show you how to capture a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance. The session will help you decide what and when to capture data and where to store it. Then we will walk through different tools and scripts to use.  Then walk you through a scenario of using that data to identify a problem.
