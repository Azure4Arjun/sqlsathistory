## Title: Diagnosing performance problems on Azure SQL
## Abstract:
### Dynamic Management Views, wait sats, executions statistics, Extended Events. Those are the tools you use on SQL Server on-prem to diagnose long running queries and server weaknesses. You use more or less the same tools on Azure SQL, but there are differences: permissions, database-specific views, XEvents ring buffer reading. In this session, we will address specific queries and views, and diagnosis steps specific to Azure SQL.
