## Title: SQL Server 2016 - Temporal Data Tables (System-Versioned)
## Abstract:
### There are many new features in SQL Server 2016, but the one we will focus on in this session:
•	Temporal Database Tables
One of the many new features in SQL server 2016 is the built-in support for temporal data tables. This is a feature that many developers have been urging to have as a “out of the box feature” – and therefore many have developed their own ways of implementing the capability to store information about how data looked in a certain period of time.
What is a Temporal Data Table?
The concept of a temporal data table is that the table will hold information about a records value in any point in time – thus meaning that we easily can read from the table and get values that are not current, but merely a historical view of the record.
There will be many demo's and script will be shown and shared.
