## Abstract:
### Take a look in the future of SQL Server and experience the new T-SQL features in SQL Server 11 (code named Denali). This session is a deep dive into the new OFFSET option for paging, error handling improvements with THROW, sequences, enhancements to EXECUTE for results sets, and new features to describe query and procedures result sets and parameters. You will see practical code demos describing the use cases for these T-SQL extensions.
