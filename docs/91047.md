## Title: The intelligent Firing Range (Building Server-less python applications)
## Abstract:
### How to build an automatic score calculator for a nerf gun firing range using various Microsoft technologies. 
In this session we will explore how to implement an end to end solution to detect nerf darts fired at a target, the challenges involved and how to overcome them.   
The technologies involved will  range from Power Apps for user interaction and orchestration, Azure SQL DB for information storage, Azure Storage for file storage, Azure functions to ensure automation and provide a server-less environment for the python script and, last but not least, PowerBI to display the results. 
At the end of the session you'll have an understanding of how to set up these different technologies to work together seamlessly.
