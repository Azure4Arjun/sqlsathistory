## Title: SQL Server Filesystem
## Abstract:
### As part of the SQL Server OS, SQL Server has its own file system built on top of the Windows NTFS.  Understanding how the SQL Server filesystem works and how it interacts with NTFS and storage is critical to SQL Server performance.  This presentation will start with a  brief review of NTFS and then go into depth on the SQL Server filesystem.  It should help you understand:
•         Why is fragmentation bad for performance?
•         Why should I allocate more than one file in a filegroup?
•         Why should I not rely on autogrow to size my SQL files?
•         Why is autoshrink a very bad thing?
•         What should my NTFS allocation unit size be set to?
•         How many files should tempdb have?

All this and more!
