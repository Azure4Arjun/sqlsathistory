## Title: The Flash-Enhanced Database [Sponsored]
## Abstract:
### Imagine if storage I/O latency was no longer an inhibiter to database performance, growth, maintenance, and opportunity. Consider a world where the storage administrator no longer had to tell you, “No!” Pure Storage will share how they are making this dream a reality for DBAs everywhere. Welcome to a world where reports are faster, maintenance gets to complete, and database recovery is instant.
