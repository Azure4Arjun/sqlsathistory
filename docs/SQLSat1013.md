## Speaker: Patrick Gallucci
## Title: Build a Complete Azure Data Platform in 1 Hour
## Abstract:
### Migrating Data and Analytic workloads to Azure gives organizations the ability to innovate faster with the Azure Data Platform. To unlock the potential, it typically takes months to architect, engineer, and deploy a Modern Data and Analytics Platform in Azure. Even with a prescriptive approach for cloud adoption, many organizations are not equipped to take on the full scope of responsibility required to leverage the all-up capabilities they have acquired as a result of the project.
Patrick Gallucci will share a service delivery approach that helps organizations move large and small data platforms to Azure. He will show you how to leverage proven cloud adoption methodologies, tools, resources, and best practices to enable your organization to simplify and accelerate their move to the cloud.

## Title: Handle Data with Care
## Abstract:
### Security, privacy, data leaks, industrial espionage are terms we hear on a daily basis.

Before answering this question for yourself, check out the link entitled "World's Biggest Data Breaches  Hacks":
https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/
Data Breaches figures are generally measured in the tens and hundreds of millions of records. However, the other side of the medal from the Hall of Fame is that it is unprotected data from databases that have reached the "deep web". What happens next, hypothetically, can have very serious consequences. 
Is everything just so black? Learn about it on this session.
