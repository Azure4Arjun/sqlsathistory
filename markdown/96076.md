## Title: How to Query the Tabular Data Model using DAX
## Abstract:
### Have you implemented Power BI in your work to build powerful dashboards and want to encapsulate complex business logic? Do you struggle writing MDX queries in the multidimensional model? If your answer is yes, then join me in this DAX presentation to see how to create measures that make use of the DAX language. I will go over the DAX (Data Expression Language), powerful functions such as SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(), HASONFILTER(), CALCULATE(), USERELATIONSHIP(), RELATED(), FILTER(), ALL() and many more. I will go over the use of variables to make your DAX expression self-documenting and create additional columns in the dimension Date table that slicers or parameters can use to detect the years/months with actual data in Fact Tables.
