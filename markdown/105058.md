## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Breaking the fourth wall to connect with your audiences
## Abstract:
### Creating a presentation isn’t easy and neither is attending a presentation. Reading a thousand slides in dozens of presentations over a few days at a conference can make the most enthusiastic audience member glaze over. Presenters need to find ways to be interesting. To connect with their audiences. To help audiences stay engaged and grasp the key things being taught. This session will help you the presenter understand the different types of audience connection, so that you can help them use different parts of their brains and stay with you. You'll learn to move away from PowerPoint and into powerful points instead.
