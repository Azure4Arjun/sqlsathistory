## Title: Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere. Doing it Right!
## Abstract:
### For most DBAs virtualization is no longer a matter of "If" but "When". This means it is critical for DBAs to understand how this technology works and how we can ensure we get the most performance and scalability out of it. In this session we will look at some of the best practices and gotchas when Designing Standalone and Highly Available SQL deployments in a vSphere environment.  We'll also cover how to troubleshoot performance issues when they arise.
