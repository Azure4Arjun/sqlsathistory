## Title: Presentation WOW!
## Abstract:
### So you open up PowerPoint, create your slides and get ready to present. Sure, you know exactly how to do this - you've done it a lot of times in the past - but thereâ€™s more.  Leveraging on the experiences learned from presenting at worldwide conferences such as SQL PASS Community Summit, TechEd, DevTeach and the likes, this session will look at what needs to be considered when creating powerful presentations that shine.
