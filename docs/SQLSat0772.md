Event Date: 27-10-2018 - Session time: 17:00:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: William Durkin
## Title: PowerShell for the DBA: Why I love my inner pig-dog [EN]
## Abstract:
### DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring  a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?

In this session we will learn to embrace the power in PowerShell to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.

Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of PowerShell expertise and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!

## Speaker: Christoph Seck
## Title: Connecting SQL and Blockchain: The Azure Blockchain Workbench [EN]
## Abstract:
### Getting a PoC for a Blockchain project running is hard enough. Connecting Blockchain data to classical databases, making them available to analytics or standard applications is worse (ever queried LevelDB?).
Microsofts  new "Azure Blockchain Workbench" let you do this in hours, not months. 
We will see how to
- Deploy a Blockchain on Azure in a breeze
- Generate templates for smart contracts
- Connect them to IoT devices
- Interact with the contracts via a simple UI
- Get all the data into a "real" database automatically

## Title: Let’s build SSIS packages with Biml – live [EN]
## Abstract:
### You have heard about Biml? Maybe even seen a session about it before but still have doubts, how easy you can make something useful out of it? In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos! Everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we’re going to end up with a complete solution over the course of this session, to prove that it is not just easy to adapt existing Biml code but also to start from scratch and still be successful very quick!

Let’s see, how that goes…

## Title: The joy of analytics - Let's paint a Data Warehouse into the cloud [EN]
## Abstract:
### There are a lot of possibilities get insights out of your data, and since years we are doing this with "old-fashioned" techniques in our "classical" data warehouse environments. But the world is changing, and so its data.
Where the data years ago was always structured, the growth of different data types now seems to be infinite. We are struggling with saving data with changing schemas and getting insights of new data types like social media, video, and pictures.

In this whiteboard session, I would like to talk with you about modern ways to store, analyze and visualize data. We will draw a Modern Data Warehouse and have a look at the ways to get more insights out of your data and why the cloud could help us.

Come and join my session and draw a Modern Data Warehouse together.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server [EN]
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2016 introduced the most important change to query tuning in ages, the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works in Azure, SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. You will learn how Query Store changes the methods you use to troubleshoot and tune query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server databases.

## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: Becoming a hipster DBA, a guide to Github and CI/CD for Admins [EN]
## Abstract:
### The use of securing your code in source control and testing it automatically with a continuous integration tool is not something developers need to be convinced of. But DBAs have traditionally not used any of these techniques. It's also not that straight forward for them. Checking the outcome of a typical DBA script usually involves the need for infrastructure to be available in a certain state and tests that check the changes made to that infrastructure. This session will combine an introduction level talk about Git(hub) and Continuous Integration with the complexity of Infrastructure testing aimed ad DBAs.

## Speaker: Tobias Koprowski
## Title: Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners [EN]
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released SQL Azure more than eight years ago - that's enough time for testing. So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (aka production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for back up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually (sic!) restoring data. 

In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionalities, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure DB and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012/2014/2016/2017. We will look for topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Speaker: Tillmann Eitelberg
## Title: Embrace and Extend: First-Class Activity and 3rd Party Ecosystem for SSIS in ADF
## Abstract:
### This session focuses on the deeper integration of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the broad extensibility of Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS IR – dedicated ADF servers for lifting  shifting SSIS packages – and extend it with custom/3rd party components. Preserving your skillsets, you can then use the familiar SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)/SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to design/deploy/configure/execute/monitor your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. Next, we will guide you to trigger/schedule SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combine/chain them with other activities, allowing you to inject/splice built-in tasks/data transformations in your ETL/ELT workflows, automatically provision Azure-SSIS IR on demand/just in time, etc. And finally, you will learn about the licensing model for ISVs to develop paid components/extensions.
