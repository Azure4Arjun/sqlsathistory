## Title: Anatomy of the DAX Query Plan
## Abstract:
### When queries against your tabular model run slowly, you need deeper insight into the problem to come up with the correct solution. Your first step should be to review the DAX query plan, but what exactly are you looking for? In this session you’ll learn how to access the query plan and what types of information the logical and physical plans contain. You’ll also learn which elements in the query plan are most important in your troubleshooting process and, just importantly, what type of information you cannot glean from the query plan.
