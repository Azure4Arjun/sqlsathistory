## Speaker: Chris Smith
## Title: A Better Way to Run MsSql (aka Can You Believe This is Even Possible?!?!)
## Abstract:
### Ten years ago, if you said that we would someday run Sql Server not only on Linux, but on Linux ON WINDOWS, you'd have been laughed out of the room. Here in 2020, though, not only is it possible, but it's faster and easier than installing Sql Server the old-fashioned way!

In this talk, we'll discuss:
1. The basics how to run Docker containers locally on Windows 10.
2. How to get Sql Server for Linux running on it.
3. How to connect to it locally for your development needs.
