## Title: Real-time Data Warehousing for rapid BI Analysis
## Abstract:
### Having BI measures available in real-time is a challenging endeavor that requires putting together a dependable architecture with many moving parts. In this demo-rich session we will explore database and ETL architectures that let you reliably move data from your application databases across the enterprise in real-time to your data warehouse. You will see how to use the many features provided by SQL Server such as Replication, Change Data Capture, SSIS, and other techniques to extract, transform, and load data fast and dependably. The development of an actual real-time system during the session from beginning-to-end will be shown, that by its conclusion will populate a star schema with actual data. We will also discuss and walk through alternative real-time architectures such as data virtualization. Finally, we will see how to create cubes and reports to present data with a minimum amount of latency.
