## Speaker: Ryan Wade
## Title: Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?
## Abstract:
### R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the quot;Wickham stackquot; which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may encounter.
