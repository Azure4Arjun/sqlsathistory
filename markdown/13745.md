## Title: SQL Server and Networking High Availability/Disaster Recovery Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Do you think you can handle Failover Clustering and Availability Groups? Think again. Your job description as a SQL Server DBA has just changed. In this demo-centric session, youâ€™ll see how networking aspects such as Active Directory and DNS play very important roles when implementing a SQL Server high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) solution. You will want to be confident enough to have a conversation with your Domain Administrator to make sure your SQL Server databases meet their recovery objectives and service level agreements.
