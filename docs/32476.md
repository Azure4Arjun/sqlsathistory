## Title: Virtualization and Consolidation best practices
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn from one of the largest deployments of Microsoft SQL Server with over 5000 servers. Join the experts from Dell Services to learn how, when, and what to do when faced with the question “what is the best virtualization solution to save money on database infrastructure?” Virtualization is knocking on every ones door, including DBAs. Recent economic challenges have forced us all to do more with less. 
You will learn how we managed our internal consolidation efforts. We will cover the best practices for configuring the database engine, Analysis Services and Reporting Services. We also touch on the best practices on virtualization, consolidation and achieving up to 100 to 1 reduction in SQL Servers.
