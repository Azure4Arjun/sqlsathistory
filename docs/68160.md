## Title: Power BI Administration and Governance
## Abstract:
### Power BI is an incredible tool and as more companies and individuals adapt this new technology it is time to turn our focus from report development to Administration. Noone really wants to discuss Administration but it's important to understand the security risks and how to mitigate those risks through proper administration. In this session, we will discuss an overview of Power BI Administration as it relates to security and governance.
