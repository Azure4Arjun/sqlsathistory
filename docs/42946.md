## Title: Source Control practices for your BI World
## Abstract:
### Source Control is a critical part of any development effort. For small shop developers tools like TFS can be overwhelming especially for developers that come from organizations with little to no source control experience.  Let's talk about practices and ways to implement source control for SSIS, SSRS and Database Projects in both multi-developer and multi-tiered environments.  We will cover when and how to branch, merge and shelve and discuss ideas around process for deployment and continuous integration.
