## Title:  Database design with performance in mind
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest benefits of SQL Server is simplicity. Developer creates a database, write a few T-SQL statements and everything is up and running.. until the system grows up and starts to introduce performance problems. And infinite loop begins: Refactor -> Deploy -> Refactor -> Deploy ->.. In a few years developer has gray hairs and ton of experience. 

The purpose of this session is sharing this experience helping to avoid some of the typical issues for the systems working under heavy load. The session gives the overview of how SQL Server stores data, what criteria Query Optimizer uses choosing the index, how data is locking - essential knowledge when you expect system to handle thousands transactions per second.
