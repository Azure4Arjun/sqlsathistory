# SQLSaturday #437 - Boston - BI Edition 2015
Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 13:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Kevin Goff
## Title: T-SQL for Application Developers - Attendees chose
## Abstract:
### That's right, attendees choose! I'll show 30 possible topics on the screen, and the attendees vote on which topics I'll cover. Everything from isolation levels to ranking...everything from GUIDs to table-valued functions....everything from querying temporal data to instances where subqueries are necessary....everything from update triggers to reading execution plans. The good news is that you'll walk away with 30 code samples, even though we'll only cover a portion of them in the presentation. This has always been a very popular session.
