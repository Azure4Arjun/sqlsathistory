## Title: Maximizing SSIS Package Performance
## Abstract:
### So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.
