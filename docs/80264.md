## Title: The freedom to choose. Selecting the correct SQL Server flavor for you
## Abstract:
### In the past, choosing the right SQL Server meant that you basically only needed to choose the correct edition. Then came the question whether you going to have it virtualized or not.
Nowadays, while virtualized or not is almost always answered “virtualized”, there are much more questions to answer before you can finalize your decision: where will the database be hosted, will it be on-premise or in the cloud, on windows or on Linux, do I want to create the database engine myself or use a managed database and many more. Join this session to get an overall view of all options available including Azure DB, APS, RDS, Azure IASS, Azure managed instances, hybrid solutions and more. We will talk about the considerations for choosing any of the options and discuss the relative benefits of each.
