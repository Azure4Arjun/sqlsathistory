## Title: What is DevOps?
## Abstract:
### We believe if you are in a competitive market, the companies that have a DevOps culture will have the best chance of succeeding.  But what is a DevOps Culture?
 
DevOps is one of those terms that has transcended its initial use.
You still see people talk about being DevOps Engineer or do DevOps for SQL, but you also hear about a company being a DevOps company, having a DevOps Culture. What does it all mean?
In this talk we will discuss and probably argue what DevOps is and isn't. I'll put forward what we consider a DevOps culture, what are the core elements, who does what and importantly what breaks it.
 
You will gain an understanding of why companies with such a culture can get solutions to market quicker and can respond to changes better than their competition.
