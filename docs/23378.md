## Title: Building Hybrid BI Solutions with Power BI
## Abstract:
### As organizations look to lower infrastructure costs and increase worker productivity, two industry trends have emerged: the shift to the cloud and self-service. How will these trends change the way we build BI solutions, without compromising on security, manageability and governance? Join this session and find out!

We will explore the following questions: What is Power BI? What do you need to run Power BI? How does Power BI differ to traditional BI? Where does Power BI fit in a broader enterprise BI strategy? And, finally, how can on-premises data sources be used in cloud-based Power BI solutions?

In addition to answering these questions, we will build a Power BI solution from scratch using both on-premises and cloud-based data sources. We will use Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map, before deploying the solution to a Power BI site in the cloud, and interacting with it using Q  A, the new natural language query technology.
