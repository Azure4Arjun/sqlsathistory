## Title: Why Should I Use Stored Procedures?
## Abstract:
### With the proliferation of ORM Tools like Linq To SQL, NHibernate, there has been a move to no longer use stored procedures for Data Access, I personally disagree.  This will be a professional and polite open discussion starting with why I believe stored procedures are the best way to access data in SQL Server.  Alternate view points welcome.
