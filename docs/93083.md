## Title: SQL Access to SaaS/Cloud Data through PolyBase and Linked Servers
## Abstract:
### Data virtualization technologies enable modern organizations to operate across disparate data sets without the need to consolidate data storage through warehousing and ETL processes. Technologies like PolyBase and SQL Server Linked Servers bring this capability to SQL Server, enabling users to query external data like any other table in SQL Server. 
 
In this talk, we will discuss the virtualization features of SQL Server 2019 PolyBase and the distributed querying enabled by SQL Linked Servers and examine how we can issue Transact-SQL queries that connect data across SQL Server and SaaS/Cloud or NoSQL data sources.
