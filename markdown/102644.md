## Title: Charlie and the Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory is your golden ticket to moving and transforming data in Azure!  On your tour of the factory you'll learn all the basics - Pipelines, Datasets, Connections and Triggers.  Taking a closer look at pipelines, you'll see how to use a variety of activities, set up variables and parameters, and view debugging output.  Next you'll learn how to monitor your pipelines and how using templates can improve your Data Factory experience.  Finally you'll get to see the data mapping capabilities of Data Flows.  By the end of your tour, you'll be saying that Azure Data Factory is Scrumdiddlyumptious!
