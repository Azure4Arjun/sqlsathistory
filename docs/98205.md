## Title: T-SQL Tools: Using JSON as a Data Source
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look into different methods focusing on effective use of T-SQL to ingest JSON data and explore ways to bridge the gap between structured and semi-structured data.

We will look at the benefits of a loosely defined schema and how to transform the data to work in a relational model.
