## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### "I've got a locking problem", "I need to get rid of blocking," and "deadlocks are normal behavior" are all things heard way too many times.  

In this session targeted at the accidental or new DBA, we will walk through each of these items, what they are, what their causes are, which of them are normal behavior and which are not, and some common causes of deadlocks and excessive blocking.
