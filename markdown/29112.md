## Title: The Business End of Data Modeling
## Abstract:
### This presentation is about what to expect before you start database design and what to do if you don't get it.  We, as SQL Server Database professionals, apply technology solutions to meet business needs.  The problem is that sometimes we're expected to meet business needs that aren't well defined, or not defined at all.  Attendees will learn about the requirements side of data modeling and how it prepares a database developer to design and build the right solution.  Then, the presentation will cover typical scenarios where critical business definition elements are missing and what the database professional can do make up for the missing requirements pieces and produce a successful result.
