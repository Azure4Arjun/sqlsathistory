## Title: SQL Server 2016 - New Feature Preview
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is here. Curious what all the hype is about?

We#39;ll take a stroll down memory lane to remind us how far we#39;ve come and then explore some of the brand new features.

Time travel with Temporal Tables. Watch the gears turn with Live Query Statistics. Go shopping in the Query Store. And impress your developer friends with some freshly minted JSON.

Maybe we#39;ll even figure out how to bottle up that new version smell.
