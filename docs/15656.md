## Speaker: James Skipwith
## Title: Database Partitioning - Part I
## Abstract:
### In Session One:  - Just what is database partitioning?  - Do I even need it?  - So what can be done in Standard edition?  Knowledge is power and after these sessions those big tables won’t be so scary anymore. They can be tamed and will soon be purring like a kitten. It’s never all pain-free sailing partitioning large live tables but, armed with the correct knowledge, you can start planning and implementing your partitioning. Sweet.
