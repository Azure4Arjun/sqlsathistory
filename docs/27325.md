## Title: Instant Scale, High Avail.  Performance for SQL
## Abstract:
### Achieving scale-out quickly and easily for MS SQL Server environments can be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Other areas that are difficult or costly to achieve for SQL Server environments include transparent caching of Read queries, as well as instrumentation and Analytics of all SQL queries in *real-time*.  In this session, you will learn how ScaleArc has developed SQL Server infrastructure software that achieves instant scale-out, caching, load balancing, firewall/filtering and higher availabilityâ€¦without any changes or modifications to existing applications or SQL Server databases.  For those interested in migrating to SQL Server 2012, we will also discuss how ScaleArc can assist and add-value in a 2012 migration.
