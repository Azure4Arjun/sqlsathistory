## Title: Writing MDX in Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Writing MDX can be a little intimidating and so most people that have to create an SSRS report against a cube will use the Query Designer. However, there are advantages to being able to write and craft your own MDX.

This session will walk the audience through writing MDX in Reporting Services versus using the Query Designer. During the session we will point out the good and the bad of each approach.
