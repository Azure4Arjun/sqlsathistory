## Title: 5 Critical Considerations When Moving to the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Migrating an existing on-premises SQL Server application to the cloud can be a daunting task that consists of many complicated steps. In this session, we will focus on what is perhaps the MOST important step of the process – those that lead up to the actual move to the cloud. 
We will dive deep into the most critical considerations for moving your data and databases into the cloud, whether you use Microsoft Azure, Amazon, or another cloud provider.
We will cover:
•	The importance of cleansing your data before a major migration
•	Fully documenting your data sources and metadata
•	Choosing from many different tools and techniques to actually move data
•	How to test data for fidelity
•	How to maintain parallel systems during transitional phases
We'll also share demos and overviews of native features within SQL Server that enable you to move data, as well as show powerful tools from the SentryOne product set that can make data migrations painless!
