## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Agile Ops at Billions of Transactions a Day Without Losing Your M
## Abstract:
### Every time a human touches a computer, they can damage it”. We’re all human, we all touch computers, and we all have stories to back up that statement. What about dozens of people touching thousands of busy 24x7 clusters, instances, databases, and AGs? Defined processes help, but how do you keep them from bogging down critical fix-it-now work and still prevent damage? Grab lunch and join some Salesforce DBAs as we discuss scaling ITIL, DevOps, and coding your way to an easier life.
