## Speaker: Geoff Hiten
## Title: Bad SQL
## Abstract:
### How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.

## Speaker: Jana Sattainathan
## Title: Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
## Abstract:
### Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle.  The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning.  It is simple, efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.

# Processing Flat Files with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#46---Raleigh-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
## Abstract:
### When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Patterns for SSIS Configuration and Deployment
## Abstract:
### Some of the most common issues encountered with SSIS are related to configuring and deploying the packages in different environments. There are a number of options for how to configure your package, and more options for how to deploy them. When you combine the available options, the possibilities can be overwhelming. During this session, we will discuss several patterns for handling configurations and deployment in SSIS. Specifically, we’ll cover two patterns for configurations – a simple pattern that can be applied to most scenarios, and a more complex pattern that provides a great deal of flexibility. We’ll also cover two methods of deploying the packages that leverage the configuration patterns.
