## Title: Benchmarking: The Forgotten Role of Performance
## Abstract:
### As DBAâ€™s in the SQL Server world become increasingly concerned with performance management of the SQL Servers, the interesting item that appears to be forgotten by most is the underlying performance characteristics of the hardware, the database and lastly the SQL Code that is been run against the server. If the hard disk system can only write at 200mb per second than the I/O issue that the DBA is confronting maybe hardware related and not the queries that are been run against the database.
