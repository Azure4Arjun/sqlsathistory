## Title: A SQL table, CSV file, and an Excel spreadsheet walk into a bar chart...figuratively speaking.
## Abstract:
### "Get Data"; "Power Query"; "M Functional Language".  No matter what you call it, Power Query is a game changer for business analysts who may require access to a variety of data sources for data analysis and reporting.  Business users of Excel that have long used VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables to analyze data now have a frontend tool that can do much of the dirty work to ease the pain of connecting to different data sources and of transforming data prior to performing data analysis.
