## Title: Custom maps in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Let’s go beyond the standard visuals available in Power BI for making maps. In this session we won’t talk about Bing or ArcGIS services. We want to explore all the available features for creating custom maps without having to rely on existing ones. 
Do you know what is a shapefile? Do you know how to create your own choropleth and import it into Power BI? 
What else? R support into Power BI opened the doors to the huge number of packages for spatial data analysis and statistical calculations included in the environment. 
Do you want to draw multi-layered interactive maps? Want to geocode your data with direct calls? With R in Power BI, now you can. 
Last but least, we will able to discover Synoptic Panel, an awesome component that connects areas in a custom image with attributes in the data model and draws the data on a map. There are endless possibilities; the only limit is your imagination!
