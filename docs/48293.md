## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Becoming the Data Platform Engineer of Tomorrow
## Abstract:
### You're a DBA/Dev/BI Professional (delete as appropriate), what will your role be like in five years time? In this session we will talk about how the industry has changed over the last couple of years and hypothesize on where it is going and the type of work we might be doing and technologies that we will be dealing with.

Will the traditional developer, BI and DBA roles that we know so well today be the same, or will we need to diversify and look at expanding into other areas to stay ahead of the curve?
