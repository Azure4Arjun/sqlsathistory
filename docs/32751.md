## Title: Programming with FileStreams
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced the FileStream object.  This allowed developers to resolve an age long dilemma of storing large binary files in the database or accessing them on the file system.  SS08 provides the best of both worlds while allowing applications to access the data readily through the FileStream object via Transact SQL or File I/O.
