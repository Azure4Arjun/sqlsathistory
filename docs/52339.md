## Title: Machine Learning  with SQL Server 2016 R Services
## Abstract:
### Microsoft recently launched SQL Server 2016, which, in addition to many other great features, offers in-database advanced analytics with R Services, allowing users to combine the power of SQL Server and Microsoft R Server (or Open Source R), without data leaving the database.

With SQL Server R Services, users can develop analytic models in a local R IDE and it has it's own template as well for support different industry needs.
