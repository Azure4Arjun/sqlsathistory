## Title: SSIS 2012: A Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog
## Abstract:
### New in SQL Server 2012, the SSIS catalog provides a rich set of built-in tools for capturing/reporting package logging, statistics, and other interesting things all within a few keystrokes or mouse clicks.  This session will focus on the internals of this new catalog and how to use it.  You will learn how to extend and query the metadata captured by the package execution process and how to navigate your way around the built-in reports.
