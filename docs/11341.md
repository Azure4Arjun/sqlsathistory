## Title: SQL Server Replication in Practice
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Replication is an important tool that Iâ€™ve implemented many times for reliable data movement to support Business Intelligence architectures. This includes using replication to create databases that are used as sources for data warehouses, reporting systems, operational data stores, and historical audit trails.  The key concepts to consider when setting up replication will be covered, including replication type, table selection, filters, indexing, and more.  Live demonstrations will show how to implement transactional replication for high performance in a real-time environment.
