## Speaker: Gary Lock
## Title: Quick and Dirty Push Datasets with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of different data sources.  Once you have published your data to the Power BI service, you can use an on-premises gateway to refresh your datasets up to every 15 minutes.  Power BI can also connect live to large cubes that are a result of very complex ETL and calculations.  Some of these cubes may only be refreshed daily or weekly.  For real-time streaming of data, you can use Azure Stream Analytics or the Power BI REST API.  

Have you heard of Power BI push datasets?  With push datasets, data is pushed into the Power BI service.  Since it is stored there, you can use all of Power BI's report building features with it.

In this session, I walk through the different options for real-time streaming in Power BI.  I will demonstrate setting up a push dataset and show you a very easy way to push data to Power BI using PowerShell.  I will also demonstrate a Power BI push dataset connected to a Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision app.

# APPLY Yourself
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#755-South-Florida-2018)
Event Date: 09-06-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DevOps
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Speaker: Frank Quintana
## Title: Data Science, and the changing Role of Data professionals; Data-Information-Knowledge and Wisdom
## Abstract:
### Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually teaches at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? Which skills do we need?

## Title: So You think You can Speak?
## Abstract:
### If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at a SQL Saturday or a Summit , remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.
If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Microsoft Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is here! 
"Do You Think You can Speak" is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL, Business Intelligence, Power BI, or otherwise, that is informative, useful, and entertaining.
