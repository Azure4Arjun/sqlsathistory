# Dynamic Partitioning Cubes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence - Business Track
## Speaker: Brian Boenk
## Title: Dynamic Partitioning Cubes
## Abstract:
### In every project on Business Intelligence there comes a time when the code needs to be deplyed to the production environment.
No more development, no more manual work.
But what about the partitions on the cube? Do we really need to tell and learn the DBA how to handle that on a periodic plan?
The answer is simple: No!

# Migrating to PDW? Lessons from the Field 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Applied
## Speaker: James Rowland Jones
## Title: Migrating to PDW? Lessons from the Field 
## Abstract:
### Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) isn't SQL Server - it's different. It's bigger than that. It's a massively parallel-processing, distributed-database platform that leverages SQL Server as part of its architecture. But it has so much more to offer...

 In this 1-hour session, you will learn how to "embrace the change" and accelerate your migration to the data warehouse storage engine for the Microsoft Data Platform. This session will be packed with advice and recommendations from actual customer deployments and real-world experiences. Get on board the PDW train, and transform your data warehouse with the Microsoft Big Data Analytics Appliance!

# Autogenerating a process data warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence – Technical Track
## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: Autogenerating a process data warehouse
## Abstract:
### In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you how Rehfeld has overcome this difficult problem using an autogenerated datawarehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can autogenerate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos.

# Partitioning as a design pattern
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence - Business Track
## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: Partitioning as a design pattern
## Abstract:
### How do you design a data warehouse for the handling of management information in seven subject areas for all 98 municipalities in Denmark? Especially when there exists up to five different IT systems per field, and that the municipalities can use the systems differently. Add to this a requirement to change the business rules for each municipality, and the ability to report on one municipality, while data for another municipality is updated.

The talk is relevant for DBA's, (BI) developers and BI architects.

## Speaker: Neil Hambly
## Title: MDS and DQS - Beyond the TLAs to Data Quality
## Abstract:
### Many three-letter acronyms (TLAs) adorn our database world. This session focuses on two recent additions – MDS (Master Data Services) and DQS (Data Quality Services) – explaining what the new features are and exploring how to leverage them to improve your data quality. 

High data quality is fundamental to any business analytics system. In this session, we’ll begin with an overview of data quality and the latest Microsoft tools available, and then demonstrate MDS and DQS and how to use them together for continuously improving data quality. We’ll also look at how to integrate them into your existing data-quality strategies. Data quality is everyone’s responsibility – but we can still lead the way forward. Join this session to see how.

# Automate your SSIS development with BIML
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence – Technical Track
## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: Automate your SSIS development with BIML
## Abstract:
### Ever tried to import a file with the Import/Export wizard?
Or created a bunch of SSIS packages to process a data warehouse load?
Then you know how much work it is to specify the metadata correctly just to create a package that actually works.
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a descriptive language which looks at your metadata and just created the packages for you?
This is what BIML is all about. 
In this session I explain what BIML is, how it works and I'll show you how you can generate your packages and quickly respond to changes.
You can expect a demo rich session with lots of notes from the field and practical examples.
This is not just for BI developers, DBA's or SQL dev's who need to import or export data occasionally will learn some quick and easy tricks as well.

# SQOOP - Taking relational data to Hadoop and back again
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#281---Edinburgh---BI-Edition-2014)

## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: SQOOP - Taking relational data to Hadoop and back again
## Abstract:
### SQOOP or SQL to Hadoop is a tool in the Hadoop ecosystem that lets you take your "SQL" data and put it into Hadoop or vice versa.  The use cases are numerous.  You can have Hadoop perform the heavy lifting using Map Reduce and then use SQOOP to take the results and put them in "SQL".  You can have Hadoop act as your Data Warehouse and use SQOOP to do your daily loads from your relational DB into Hadoop.
SQOOP is a command line tool but don't let that put you off.  
This session will look at SQOOP and the plethora of options available to you on the command line.  If you want to learn about SQOOP then this is the session for you.
