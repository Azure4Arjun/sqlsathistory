#### [Back to calendar](#nr-714)
Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: PreCon (Friday)
## Speaker: Eugene Meidinger
## Title: Power BI Implementation: A Guide to the Other 90%
## Abstract:
### When learning about Power BI, the part you learn first is all the powerful visuals. But like an iceberg, that's just the 10% everyone sees. If you are asking yourself "what's next?", this training will teach your the other 90%.

In the first half of the day, we will focus on data manipulation. Often times, the hardest part of making a report is shaping the data. We will cover applied database theory, data cleansing with PowerQuery and data modelling with DAX. We'll show you what each tool is good at and when to use it. We'll also cover some internals so you understand at a deeper level how these tools really work.

The second half of the day is all about deployment and administration. Do you have a data governance plan in place? We'll show how to access your on-premises data with data gateways. We'll cover options for securing and protecting your data, including row-level security and auditing. Finally, we'll go over the ways you can share and distribute these reports.

# XML and JSON deep dive
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-714)
Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: PreCon (Friday)
## Speaker: Alex Grinberg
## Title: XML and JSON deep dive
## Abstract:
### In the modern world of information technology, keeping data stored and manipulated reliably
and efficiently is one of the top priorities. Within the last decade, SQL Server has evolved into a
sophisticated Enterprise RDBMS tool, and it is still growing by providing more functionalities to store
and manipulate data reliably. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is one of the technologies that SQL
Server implements not only for data manipulation but also for internal usage, such as Execution Plans,
Extended Events, DDL trigger Eventdata() function, and behind-the- scenes construction for SQL Server
Business Intelligence Tools (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS). XML skills often appear in SQL Server DBA job
requirements because the ability to work with XML allow the DBA to be faster and more efficient when
solving different types of problems.

# Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-714)
Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

# Statistics and Cardinality – How they work together
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-714)
Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Statistics and Cardinality – How they work together
## Abstract:
### Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and the new cardinality estimator can have.

## Speaker: James Serra
## Title: Big data architectures and the data lake
## Abstract:
### With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!

Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Technical Vendor Session
## Speaker: Jerod Johnson
## Title: REST Easy - Instant APIs for Your Database
## Abstract:
### SQL Server provides database technology built with industry-leading performance, top-notch security and compliance, mission-critical availability, and a consistent experience across platforms and devices.

 API-driven data consumption platforms and services highlight the need for RESTful access to SQL server data. The existing options for REST access to SQL Server data or using web development frameworks to convert relational data to JSON objects soak up time, resources, and energy on software development and maintenance that enterprises could be using to drive business.

With the CData API Server, users can rapidly create RESTful APIs for SQL Server data using a point-and-click interface. API Server includes everything needed to create, run, manage, and secure APIs for your SQL Server data. In this talk, we will walk through creating an OData API for SQL Server data and demonstrate connectivity using modern web development frameworks.

## Speaker: Walter Shields
## Title: Remember what it’s like to be a Beginner?
## Abstract:
### As an educator, I have seen such a wide demographic of people being attracted to databases and SQL. Wanting to understand how it all works and eager to learn this technology. From students majoring in computer science, business, and marketing to working professionals like developers, business analyst, marketing analyst and business managers. 

This is the new crop of beginners I see every day that are attracted to you and what you do as a professional in database technology! 

The thing is, as attractive as we are; to someone who wishes to enter this field; the actual steps they must take to become part of this profession can seem daunting. 

In this session, I will walk us down memory lane back to the place we all started, as a beginner. I will raise your awareness of just how influential you already are and how you can use that influence to help those starting on their journey to understanding databases and SQL.

## Speaker: Tracy Boggiano
## Title: Collecting Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or whether or not a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? The answer is baseline metrics.

Only if you have baseline performance information can you answer these questions and form a plan to address the issues at hand. In this session, we will be discussing several open source tools you can combine into an inexpensive baselining system you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions.

Attendees in this session will learn how to collect important metric data, what data to collect, and how to interpret that data and develop a plan of action to address any issues.

Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Extending DevOps to SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition. Unfortunately, the database is commonly considered a bottleneck. Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver. Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Speaker: Brian Carrig
## Title: Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.

Event Date: 21-04-2018 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Zachary Fanelle
## Title: Self Service Business Intelligence: Model for High Efficiency
## Abstract:
### The goal of business intelligence is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Historically, the long-standing model for this process was completely IT owned. Business users had issues with the speed of delivery with this approach, along with the lack of flexibility. The self-service business intelligence model is a methodology that addresses these problems, and gives the end users more freedom with their data.

In this discussion, Zack Fanelle will be covering the intricacies of why the self-service business model drives high levels of efficiency and productivity. This requires a new approach to collaboration with the business and IT. In addition, he will be covering technical examples of what the model would look like in 2018 and how to take advantage of it using modern products.

## Title: SQL Automation – In the Cloud, On-Premise, and Hybrid
## Abstract:
### They’re all SQL jobs, but some of your critical jobs run on local SQL Servers, while others run on Azure SQL. Still others execute across both environments. Will you maintain separate SQL Agents or other schedulers to automate these jobs? Or, will you will leverage a centralized solution? JAMS gives you complete control over every aspect of your SQL jobs – their source, their schedule, their history, their status – regardless of environment.

In this working session, we will walk through defining, executing, monitoring, and logging SQL jobs with JAMS. Then, we’ll show you how to leverage one centralized automation solution to manage all your SQL jobs, and combine them into powerful business workflows that span on-premise, cloud, and hybrid instances.
