## Speaker: Susan Schneider
## Title: From Non-Technical to Fully Employed Technical:  The Road Less Traveled.
## Abstract:
### My technical path started at a SQL Saturday event in Jacksonville in 2010.  Today I am Microsoft Certified and working full time as a Business Intelligence Report Developer.  Sometimes it’s hard to envision the finished product of your labors when you’re in the middle of the construction mess.  And it’s hard not to become frustrated when you can’t instantly learn all the great technical stuff out there.  Well, you’re heard that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your technical studies.  Building a solid technical foundation takes time and a ‘no quit’ attitude.  If there was another way to do it, I would have found it by now!  
Three foundation bricks for your technical base:
1.	How to learn/improve T-SQL on your own?  The Best and the Cheapest Way to Learn T-SQL
2.	The Importance of the Technical Community in the learning process
3.	Finding a Mentor and being a good mentee!
