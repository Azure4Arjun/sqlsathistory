## Title: Analyze and map spatial data with SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### With the widespread availability of location and spatial data to both consumers and corporations
(such as smartphone GPS data), there is a need to manage and analyze all this data as well.
SQL Server 2008 introduces new standards-based spatial data types and associated functionality
to the relational engine. Spatial data can be stored in the cloud using SQL Azure.
And SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services allows spatial data to be visualized as Maps.

In this session, we'll explore both the SQL spatial data types and SSRS maps,
using demos to show this functionality in action. We'll also cover enhancements to 
spatial functionality in the forthcoming "Denali" version of SQL Server.
