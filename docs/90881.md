## Title: GDPR - The Buck Stops Here
## Abstract:
### The General Data Protection Regulations went into effect in the EU in 2014, giving the rest of the world till May 2018 to become compliant. Comprehending the intricate facets of this complex law of EU personal data, what it covers and the demands to change how many of us have managed our data is the center of this talk. Encryption and masking is only a very small part of the DBA and developer's role in being compliant and saving the business from huge fines that could make or break a company.
