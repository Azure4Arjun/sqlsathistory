## Title: Management Data Warehouse and Data Collector
## Abstract:
### If you've ever had to answer "why was the database server was slow at 3 AM?", then you'll want to learn about the Management Data Warehouse feature in SQL Server. If you're already familiar with Server-side Tracing and Data Collector, then you'll also want to add the Management Data Warehouse to your toolkit. 

This session will cover installing and configuring the Management Data Warehouse feature in SQL Server, along with some customizations that can be added with additional Data Collector sets and custom SSRS Reports.
