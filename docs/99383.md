## Title: Loading your Data Vault with Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flows
## Abstract:
### Mapping Data Flows feature of Azure Data Factory is now generally available since October 2019.

There are many different use-case scenarios that can be covered by Data Flows, considering that Data Flows in SQL Integration Service (SSIS) projects are still playing a big role in fulfilling Extracting-Loading-Transforming (ETL) patterns for your data.

In this session, I will share my experience of populating a Data Vault repository with the help of Mapping Data Flows in Azure Data Factory.
