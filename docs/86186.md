## Title: Introduction to Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Aure Data Lake is an umbrella term consisting of multiple Azure services, most notably Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Data Lake Analytics. As the name implies, these services are built for big data processing purposes. During this session, you will gain the understanding of the use cases you should consider using these in particular. I will introduce both Data Lake Store and Data Lake Analytics, and how they have been built under the hood. In addition, I will do a couple of demos to show you how you actually can get started with them.
