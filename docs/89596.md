## Title: Setup and Configure a SQL Server with Powershell DSC
## Abstract:
### In this session, I'll show you how Powershell Desired State Configuration might help you to install and configure a Standalone SQL Server. In a second step, I'll show you how you can extend that one SQL Server with another installation and roll out AlwaysOn AvailabilityGroups also with Powershell DSC (and some dbatools cmdlets).

Why you might need this and why to think about such a scenario... I'll tell you in this session!
