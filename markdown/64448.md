## Title: Getting started with Powershell for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Do you spend your day running the same routine tasks?  Does it irk you when you do the same thing more than once?  I (sadly) still have to answer yes to one of those questions.  However, whilst I do still carry out some of the same routine tasks, learning Powershell has enabled me to automate the majority.
The potential for automation that Powershell brings, can have a huge impact on regaining precious time for a busy DBA.  The ability to create a codebase of cmdlets that sits outside your SQL Server instances allows you to introduce easy frameworks for standardisation, inventory collection and access to external processes that would be clunky in SSIS or require using the dreaded xp_cmdshell.
In this presentation, Iâ€™m going to demonstrate some of the features I use to make my life easier, from the basics of creating a Powershell profile and how different objects and inbuilt cmdlets work, to creating my own cmdlets and modules.
