## Title: From SQL to DAX â€“ another way of extract data
## Abstract:
### Summary: This presentation is to provide BI consultants and SQL developers with different DAX and tabular modeling solutions which can be replacements of SQL querying and high resource consuming ETL processes.
Abstract:
Many of us are coming from knowing SQL before they have been introduced with DAX or many of us know how to use tabular model through reporting tool but do not know they can use DAX as query language against a tabular model. 
Thus, I am glad to provide this presentation focusing on three areas:
1. How to use DAX as a query language to select columns (columns from multiple tables and from value); Group Data; Filter Data; Join Tables; Build customized calculations/measures 
2. How to use tracing tools to monitor the performance difference between SQL solution and DAX solution;
3. Use  a real life example to demonstrate how to DAX and tabular modeling  (Row Contexts vs. Filter Contexts+Bridge Table+Inactive relationship+extended table) to replace high resource ETL Processes
