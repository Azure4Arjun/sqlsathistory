## Title: Measuring BI Adoption: Dog Food Is Good For You
## Abstract:
### The most elegant solution in the world is a waste of money  effort if your users don't actually use it. Just deploying to Prod isn't enough. And simply asking your users if they like it (of if they'll sign off on UAT) isn't sufficient. Come on! We're data-people! We need proof! Proactively capturing usage information is a great way to measure user adoption  prove to your users  management that your solution is delivering a return on their investment. Or if things are bad, understand who's using it  who's not to help target your marketing  training efforts  enhancement cycles.

This session will focus on how to eat our own dog food  measure the performance of our BI solutions.  We'll focus on gathering usage stats for solutions across the core MSBI Stack (Relational DB, SSIS, SSRS, SSAS).  We'll use out-of-the-box log data, server-side traces  DMVs to capture these data points.  Then we'll look at ways to present this data back to stakeholders in scorecard format.
