## Title: Understanding SQL Server 2014's In-Memory OLTP Table Technology
## Abstract:
### Microsoft's new In-Memory OLTP Tables ("Hekaton") promise to seriously change the performance of database solutions that you can design and implement or refactor. In this session, we will examine this new technology's architecture and internals, new T-SQL syntax, and various use cases. We'll then discuss how it affects your SQL Server environment, including performance considerations, troubleshooting, administration, and high-availability design considerations.
