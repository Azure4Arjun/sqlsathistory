## Title: Getting Started with Databases on Amazon Web Services
## Abstract:
### Are you looking to understand what IaaS or PaaS really mean? Perhaps you are not sure of virtual, high available relational or NoSQL databases. Get started with the basics of managed services and platforms for running databases on AWS. Hear how to use managed relational databases such as MS SQL Server with minimal administration. Also discover other cloud options such as managed NoSQL or scaling your own instances with resizable elastic compute cloud. Take home an introduction from in-memory cache to petabyte-scale data warehouse databases in the Amazon cloud.
