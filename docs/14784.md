## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Execution Plans: What Can You Do With Them?
## Abstract:
### There’s just so much to do to get your systems to run in an optimal fashion, but where do you start. This session will walk you through an extensive checklist of things you can do to better manage your servers, databases and code. We’ll start with server configurations and what you can do with them. We’ll then move through standard administrative tasks that will help with performance. Then it’s off to the intricacies of database design and how that can affect performance. We’ll finish up with T-SQL and where it can hurt or help your systems. All examples in the session will use readily available tools that are a standard part of SQL Server. Get your own systems to run faster with the information you’ll receive.
