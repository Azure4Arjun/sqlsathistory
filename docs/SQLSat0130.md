## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

Event Date: 28-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 5. DBA
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Deep Dive into Indexes (Part 1)
## Abstract:
### No system ever performs well even on the most powerful hardware unless the database is efficiently indexed. But what does "efficient indexing" mean? Database Professionals impress customers by use of magic buzzwords such as “Indexing strategies” and “Performance tuning” and happily contribute to the myth about complexity of the subject. But with all complexity involved it’s not Rocket Science – the key point is to understand how SQL Server works with indexes and look at them from SQL Server standpoint.  This session dives into the internals of SQL Server and covers various topics such as index physical structure, how and when indexes are used, how to design efficient indexing strategy and perform the index tuning of the system.

## Speaker: James McAuliffe
## Title: It’s In There Somewhere!
## Abstract:
### Focus: FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search In SQL 2012
It’s like having the biggest junk drawer EVER.  That’s often what our “Document Repositories” become.  You know you have that golden nugget of information that you’re searching for, and it’s in there somewhere, but you can’t find it. This session explores a new feature of SQL 2012 called Statistical Semantic Search. It's like having a closet organizer on staff at all times.  While full-text search lets you query the words in a document, semantic search lets you query the meaning of the document. New scenarios we will look into will include automatic tag extraction, related content discovery, and hierarchical navigation across similar content.

# Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#130-Jacksonville-2012)

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
## Abstract:
### So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy. But now you have new requirements that require more advanced data warehouse approaches, like late arriving dimensions, bridge tables, parent child dimensions, and Type 3 or Type 6 slowly changing dimensions (SCD). How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.

## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Hello, My Name Is DAX
## Abstract:
### For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by jusst connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without develo9pment access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.

## Speaker: Troy Gallant
## Title: Indexing your Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.

## Speaker: Thomas LaRock
## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.
