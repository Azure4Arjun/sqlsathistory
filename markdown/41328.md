## Title: SQL Server 2016, New Features  Enhancements
## Abstract:
### SQL Sever 2016 is just around the corner and with it come some great new features and enhancements to existing capabilities, in this session we will look at some of these and understand how they might make us change the way that we look at designing and implementing SQL Server solutions. We will focus on the SQL Server engine, covering topics including Operational Analytics, Temporal  Stretch Tables and Always Encrypted. And we will be having a look at some of the old favorites, including enhancements to In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)  AlwaysOn Availability Groups.

By the end of this session you will have a jump-start on getting ready for the next version of SQL Server, whether you are an application developer, DBA or Business Intelligence developer.
