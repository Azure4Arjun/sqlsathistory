## Title: Azure SQL Data Warehouse for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### The power of cloud storage and compute power has made data warehousing possible for businesses of all sizes. What was once a large capital expenditure and multi-year implementation can now be deployed and ready to use within minutes and allow any organization to collect, query and discover insights from their structured data sources. 

With a full T-SQL interface and compatibility with the rest of the Microsoft data stack, Azure Data Warehouse can fit transparently into your business data strategy and leverage already existing and familiar development and management skills.
 
In this session we will look at the main concepts of the Azure SQL Data Warehouse service, how it's different than SQL Server and the advantages it provides to an on-premises solution.
