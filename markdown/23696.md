## Title: Documenting SSIS packages using XQuery
## Abstract:
### You have been given responsibility over an SSIS package.  One of the first things that you want to discover is where the data is coming from and what operations happen between the source and the target.  In this session you will learn some XQuery that you can use to trace the flow of data from different sources to SQL Server.  You will identify the Derived Column operations that alter the data from the source. You will see how to load XML from a file to query it.
