## Title: Scaling SQL Server for Large Datamarts
## Abstract:
### One of the roles of Business Intelligence for Retailers is to determine buying patterns based on customer demographics.  This type of analysis though can quickly create very large cubes above 600 Gigabytes and often between 1 to 4 Terabytes.   Based on real world experience with two major retailers, this talk will discuss key design tips and best practices for building these large cubes so the data can be accessed in a timely manner.  Key topics covered include vertical and horizontal partitioning, necessary key parameters, and custom aggregations.
