## Title: Unleashing SSIS with expressions, configurable properties, and parameters
## Abstract:
###  Have you struggled to build SSIS packages?  You are starting to get the hang of it, but many things more than basic data movement remain a frustrating challenge.  The SSIS expression language is an incredible source of power within SSIS but a profound challenge to many.  Another area of power and flexibility in SSIS is its very broadly scoped configurability.  This presentation will walk through the basics of the SSIS expression language including the whys and wherefores of a few expression peculiarities.  Then we will review how you can use those expressions to configure so many of the properties in SSIS that you might barely recognize what your package can do when you are finished.  Finally we will review input parameters and how to further influence the behavior of your packages at run time.  Download includes slide deck, expression samples, and some packages.
