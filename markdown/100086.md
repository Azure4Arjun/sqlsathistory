## Title: Azure Synapse Analytics against Google BigQuery and Snowflake. What are the main differentiators?
## Abstract:
### Data Warehousing has been traditionally deployed via on-prem MPP solutions, and due to cloud modernization, and datacenter reduction footprint initiatives, organizations are looking out to establish a relationship with a cloud solution that can help them get off the traditional storage and compute licensing scheme, to easily scale their workloads without spending millions in newly acquired hardware, and to reduce their database administration operational tasks. 
Azure Synapse Analytics, Google BigQuery and Snowflake Provide a path to migrate workloads into the cloud and allows an efficient resource utilization for both compute and storage. That is at least, what the marketing says as it has a tacit disclaimer around it. 
Azure Synapse Analytics offers scalability, pay-as-you-go compute solutions, with data contained within the database boundaries. 
The presentation shows a side by side comparison, with pros and cons of each platform and debunks some of the myths that have surfaced.
