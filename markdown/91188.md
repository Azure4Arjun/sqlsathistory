## Title: Temporal Tables:  Creation, Use, and Optimizing
## Abstract:
### With SQL 2016, Microsoft introduced Temporal tables.  In this session we will learn what a Temporal table is, and discuss uses in current environments.  We will learn how to create the tables, query the data from the tables for different scenarios, and optimize them for query performance allowing simplicity for the consumers of the data.
