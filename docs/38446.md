## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Thinking Outside of the In-Memory Box
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP comes with a large set of limitations that prevents its widespread adoption and often makes refactoring and migration of existing systems cost ineffective. This session discusses two set of topics:
1.	How to address and workaround some of In-Memory OLTP limitations, such as 8,060-byte maximum row size, missing support for unique and foreign key constraints and different indexing behavior.  
2.	How you can benefit from In-Memory OLTP objects even when system migration is cost ineffective.
