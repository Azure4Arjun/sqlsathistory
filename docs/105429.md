## Title: SQL Server on the Edge (Is it time for Pie?)
## Abstract:
### In May 2019 at the annual Build Conference Microsoft announced a new database offering, called Azure SQL Database Edge, which brings SQL capabilities to edge computing.

Running on ARM64 and x64 processors, it is an optimised relational database engine geared for IoT and IoT Edge deployments and provides capabilities such as data streaming, time series data, graph support and in-database machine learning. 

In this session we will take a quick look at the features of this offering and then demonstrate how it can be deployed and run on an ARM64 Raspberry Pi device. 

This session will be almost Demo's and will provide a clear guide on how to install and use SQL Server  in small foot print devices.
