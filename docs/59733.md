## Title: Fun with SQL Server Spatial Data
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the spatial features in SQL Server. In this session, you will learn how to create, procure and leverage spatial data.  You will be made aware of tools you can use to integrate your own spatial data with a variety of public data sources such as the Census Bureau, National Weather Service, etc. Functions and T-SQL commands related to spatial data analysis will be demonstrated. We will end the session by using the geometry data type to actually mimic a bitmapped picture using SQL (that's the fun part!).
