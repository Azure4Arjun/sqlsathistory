## Title: Xamarin Forms App with Azure Mobile Services for Authentication and Offline Sync
## Abstract:
### Xamarin offers a native cross-platform solution for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone that is written in C#. Xamarin Forms allows for cross platform development in a shared library, allowing you to spend more time creating the app and less time tailoring it to each platform. Azure Mobile Services offers many services for mobile apps including notifications, offline sync and authentication. All of these are usually intuitive and straightforward to set up.  The app we will create is a basic Xamarin Forms app that is a to do list with offline sync capabilities and authentication using Azure Mobile Services.
