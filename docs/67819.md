## Title: How to Manage Very Large Databases with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Are you experiencing challenges managing Very Large Databases (VLDBs), or anticipate challenges do to future growth? In this session, I will provide practical advice on managing very large databases (databases > 1TB) with SQL server, focusing on common problem areas for new and experienced DBAs alike. These problem areas include index maintenance, integrity checks, archival, backups, and restores. We will look at new features available in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 which make managing large databases easier, and we will explore some of the challenges and opportunities of managing large databases using SQL Server 2017 on Linux.
