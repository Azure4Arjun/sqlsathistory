## Title: Query Plans Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### In this session we will take an in depth look at how query plans work. We will go under the covers and see what happens when you run that query. 
We will also take a look at various operators, how they work, why they are chosen and how to avoid them being used in the wrong place / context,.
Attendees of this session will walk away with a greater understanding of query plans and the operators, which will enable them to both better interpret their query plans and also write more efficient SQL code
