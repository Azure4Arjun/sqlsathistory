## Title: Use Visual Studio Code to Access SQL Server from Windows (or Mac, or Linux, or ...)
## Abstract:
### "Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas."

Need a quick peek at your SQL Server database but don't want to wait for SSMS to start up? Need to run T-SQL queries from a 32-bit Windows 7 box? Working on a MacBook and don't want to switch to Windows just to run a quick SQL script? Time to try Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a free, open source code editor and IDE from Microsoft built on the Electron project which runs on most popular desktop and mobile systems and starts and executes FAST! Even better, it's extensible - using the MSSQL extension gives users access to stored connection strings, T-SQL for DDL and CRUD queries, and more. This session will demo install and use cases.
