## Title: Cardinality Estimator: A Ride from SQL 7.0 to SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Cardinality estimator, providing row estimates plays a pivotal role in obtaining efficient query plans. Cardinality estimator, which had remained unchanged since SQL 7.0, was revamped in SQL Server 2014 and was further changed in SQL Server 2016. Presentation will compare the differences between old cardinality estimator (CE 70), cardinality estimator 2014 (CE 120) and cardinality estimator 2016 (CE 130). The presentation will showcase several common real world scenarios which would directly benefit from the latest cardinality estimator. Presentation would take a deep dive ride covering the behind the scene tales detailing how the new cardinality estimator performs row estimates, resulting in accurate query plans. Presentation would also explain how regression testing can be performed using SQL Server 2016 Query Store and will highlight the scenarios where one needs to strike a balance between old and new cardinality estimators.
