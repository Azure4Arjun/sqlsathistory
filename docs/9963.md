## Title: Dimensional Modeling 101
## Abstract:
### So many names! Data warehouse, data mart, star-schema, snowflake schema, dimensional model, Type 1, Type 2, Type 3... What does it all mean?  Whether you're a data consumer, ETL specialist, or database designer, it pays to understand the vocabulary and design concepts of dimensional models.  In this session, we'll cover the basics of dimensional modeling, including dimensions, facts, and the ways they all come together.  We'll talk about why denormlization isn't necessarily a dirty word, some common design challenges, and a few ETL considerations.  By the end of the hour, you'll be ready to impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad dimensional modeling knowledge!
