## Title: SQL Server Transaction Log Internals
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is the most important aspect of a SQL Server database. Separating the data and log files is usually good advice, but there is so much more about the transaction log that is misunderstood. Join Microsoft Premier Field Engineer Tim Chapman as he discusses data modification internals, write-ahead logging and the inner workings of the SQL Server transaction log.
