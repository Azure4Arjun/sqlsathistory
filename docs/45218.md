## Title: SQL Server 2016 - Always Encrypted deep dive
## Abstract:
### With SQL Server 2016 Microsoft introduced a ground breaking feature for data encryption - Always Encrypted. It enables you to encrypt sensitive data at all times so that even people with elevated privileges do not have the power to decrypt it. But how easy is that feature to implement? Are there any hidden stones? Does this change how I write my applications? I will answer those and many more questions, so just join me and do not forget to bring your coffee for this intensive session with SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted!
