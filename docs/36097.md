## Title: Agile Data Warehouse Development
## Abstract:
### Long gone are the days when we had two to five years to deliver a Data Warehouse. Business Units want, need, and demand faster turnaround to start collecting on ROI. How can we take the Agile Methodology and apply it to Data Warehouse development? We will discuss how to apply it at the project level and then take a look at some data warehouse specific practices.
