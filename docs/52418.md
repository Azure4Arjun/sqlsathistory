## Title: Developing R and SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### If you have heard about R and want to learn how to write it yourself and run it within SQL Server 2016 you will want to come to this session.  As Microsoft is now incorporating the R language into SQL Server 2016, the language is going to be a required skill for all data professionals in the near future.  SQL Server 2016 uses a non-open source version of R, and the benefits of using that version will be reviewed too.

Using SQL Server 2016, attendees will learn how to incorporate R in SQL Server as well write R code in Visual Studio which gets data from and runs on SQL Server.  The version of R which ships with SQL Server incorporates the ability to run with more data than can be loaded into memory, and attendees will learn the best use cases for it.   

Attendees will learn the setup requirements for running R from within SQL Server 2016, and learn how to run R code from within Server Management Studio.
