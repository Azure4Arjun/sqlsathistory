## Title: Query Store Primer
## Abstract:
### This session will take a look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse. We will take a hands on look at how to use Query Store to troubleshoot problems as well as some of the new DMVs you can use to find issues as they arise.
