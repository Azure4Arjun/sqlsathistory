## Title: 3 Ways for Getting Data from SharePoint : SSIS, Excel and Access
## Abstract:
### Need to report on some data from SharePoint? We'll look at three different techniques to pull data from a SharePoint Server. We'll start with SSIS and the SharePoint List Source and Destinations. Next, we'll use Excel to connect to various SharePoint lists (both online and on premise), and finally we'll use Microsoft Access to do the same thing (and throw in the capability to do updates as well). At the end of the talk, we'll have three different ways to get data from SharePoint.
