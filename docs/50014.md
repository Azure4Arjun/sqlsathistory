## Title: Battle Scars: Porting a SQL Server app to an MPP system
## Abstract:
### Battle scars are proof of the struggles endured and won.  Find out about one particular battle in porting a SQL Server application to Netezza.  In this session, we’ll review Big Data platform options and the differences between them.  We’ll see how Massively Parallel Processor (MPP) systems (like Netezza) are different from Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) systems (like SQL Server) and witness the lessons learned in the struggle.
