## Title: Be the Javascriptiest
## Abstract:
### Angular! Knockout! Ember! Node! Batmanbacond3lodashpolymerexpressreact. The javascript landscape has suddenly become a dense jungle. So dense in fact that it is easy to become distracted by the patterns of the shiny-new-thing and forget the fundamentals of the language. This session will reaffirm how the language actually works to and how these features enable such a great ecosystem. What is the event loop? hoisting? What is `this`? What on earth does the `new` keyword actually do in a classless language? Machete a path through the fauna back to the basics.
