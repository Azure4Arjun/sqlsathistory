## Title: Biml for Beginners: Script and Automate SSIS Development
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages over and over and over again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and start automating your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session, we will first look at the basics of Biml and how to automatically generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then we will explore techniques for reusing code and implementing changes across projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to generate all the SQL scripts and SSIS packages needed to build a staging environment in just a few minutes.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!
