## Title: PowerPivot and Power View in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### This presentation introduces whatâ€™s new in PowerPivot for Excel and explores Power View.

PowerPivot, first released with SQL Server 2008 R2, is an add-in for Excel 2010 that empowers business users to create their own tabular data models. In this presentation, you will learn how the add-in has been enhanced to include an upgraded designer experience and new modeling features.

Power View is an interactive data exploration, visualization, and presentation tool that delivers an intuitive ad-hoc reporting experience for business users. The reporting must be based on a tabular model. Ordinarily, the tabular model will need to be optimized for Power View, and the basics on how to achieve this will be covered in this presentation.
