## Title: Distributed Replay: Testing With Your Data, Your Way!
## Abstract:
### Do you want to test hardware upgrades, index tuning or multi-client applications? Would you like to do this with data specific to your organization?  Distributed Replay, introduced in SQL Server 2012, is a tool that will allow you to accomplish exactly that. In this session, we will cover why you should use it, how to set it up, and what types of data to collect for testing  and replay.  This session will demonstrate tangible methods and undocumented tidbits, that you can take back to your environment to create immediate, and measurable tests.
