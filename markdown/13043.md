## Title: What are you Waiting For?
## Abstract:
### Using Wait Types and Response Time Analysis techniques is a often underutilized method for tuning SQL Server instances and applications. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the response time data is analyzed at the wrong level and is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server wait type data coupled with response time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.
