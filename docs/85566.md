## Title: Building production-ready APIs with ASP.NET Core 2.x
## Abstract:
### Creating REST APIs with ASP.NET Core is simple and comes down to defining controllers and routes. But, there are a lot of things to take care of before the API becomes ready for production. This talk is about best practices, authorization, routing, logging, data formatting, testing, documentation, versioning and monitoring REST APIs built with ASP.NET Core 2.x.
