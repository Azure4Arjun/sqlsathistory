## Title: Behavior-Driven Design and Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
## Abstract:
### Behavior-Driven Design (BDD) and test automation are key practices that allow data warehouse and business intelligence teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of test practices and automation tools out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Agile analytics practitioner Lynn Winterboer and DW/BI architect Cher Fox will share essential agile test foundations, describe BDD, and identify data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on these important agile practices, including a BDD exercise and a test automation demo!
