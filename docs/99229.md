# SQLSaturday #927 - Edinburgh 2020
Event Date: 01-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Development
## Speaker: Kevin Chant
## Title: Database Adventure
## Abstract:
### Aimed mostly at administration and based on real life scenarios, this popular audience interactive session we will go through some scenarios DBA's might encounter whilst dealing with SQL Server databases and you will be provided with some options about what to do. 

Members of the audience can then select from the options provided and we will follow that path and see what the outcome is from there. Similar to a role-playing game.

Each selection will have a different outcome, and along the way you will probably learn some new things.

As some of you may have seen on the blog www.KevinRChant.com I've already had dealing with SQL Server 2019. Therefore, this session has been updated to include SQL Server 2019 content.
