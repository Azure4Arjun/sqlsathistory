## Title: Maximizing Failure with Continuous Integration
## Abstract:
### Continuous Integration (CI) is an Agile methodology which enables teams to quickly find bugs in their code and fix them before they reach production.  The goal of CI is to always have a working product that can be deployed at any time.  Through its practice, developers fail faster and more often than ever before, allowing the developer to fix problems while they are fresh in the mind.  This session will cover the basics of CI and show how this can be implemented in a Business Intelligence environment.
