## Title: INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive
## Abstract:
### DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.
After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.
SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes
