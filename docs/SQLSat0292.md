# The Sqoop on Big Data from it’s humble beginnings to rise to notoriety

Event Date: 17-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Ginger Grant
## Title: The Sqoop on Big Data from it’s humble beginnings to rise to notoriety
## Abstract:
### Everywhere you turn in the technological literature people are talking and writing about Big Data. In this presentation you will learn about the origins of Hadoop, and how it is implemented today. In addition to the most infamous way of retrieving data from Hadoop, Map Reduce, there another way to manipulate the Hadoop data.  It is possible to query the data from Hadoop in SQL Server through the use of Sqoop. In order to better understand the logic behind Sqoop, I will present information on the Hadoop components.  Having this information will help you determine how the tools all fit together so that you will know which tools are the best choice for getting the desired answers from your data sources.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Building a Database Deployment Pipeline
## Abstract:
### The pace of business accelerates fairly continuously and application development moves right with it. But we’re still trying to deploy databases the same way we did 10 years ago. This session addresses the need for changes in organizational structure, process and technology necessary to arrive at a nimble, fast, automatable and continuous database deployment process. We’ll use actual customer case studies to illustrate both the common methods and the unique context that led to a continuous delivery process that is best described as a pipeline. You will learn how to customize common practices and tool sets to build a database deployment pipeline unique to your environment in order to speed your own database delivery while still protecting your organization’s most valuable asset, it’s data.

# Getting Started Reading Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-292)
Event Date: 17-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Getting Started Reading Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### The best way to understand why your query is running slow is to look at the execution plan. But, knowing how to get started in execution plans, what to look for, what's important, can all be terribly confusing. This session will provide you with a simple set of tasks to get you started reading execution plans. You'll learn where to start, what to look for first, and you'll be better prepared to tune your queries. We'll also look at some methods you can use to write queries against the plans themselves in order to more easily and quickly identify potential issues within your plans. The information presented will be immediately applicable on the queries you have running back in the office.

# Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-292)
Event Date: 17-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables
## Abstract:
### This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive into all the problems that you'll run into when partitioning new or existing "Write Once, Read Many" tables, such as large Audit Tables, and how to code around them.  You'll also learn the methods to support three of the best reasons for partitioning such monster tables... MUCH shorter nightly index maintenance, MUCH shorter and smaller backups, and MUCH shorter "Get back in business" piecemeal restores.  We'll also learn how to do the "impossible"... compact a File Group (one per partition) so that there's virtually no unused space in the underlying file.  After all, we don't want to set any "free" disk-space to "Read Only".  Don't let the "Advanced" rating of this session scare you away.  Anyone with a decent handle on T-SQL (or wants one) will be able to understand this session because "all will be explained" and there will be oodles of well-documented code to back up the explanations.

# Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-292)
Event Date: 17-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Michael Schulte
## Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.

# SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier

## Speaker: Brian Davis
## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
## Abstract:
### How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

# Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-292)
Event Date: 17-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.
