## Speaker: Diana Betancourt
## Title: SQL Speaker Idol
## Abstract:
### If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at an event like this, remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.  If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is Speaker idol. Speaker Idol is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL or otherwise, that is informative, useful and engaging.  This is a great way to get experience presenting a technical topic to the community, and a great way to find and develop the next generation of speakers!
