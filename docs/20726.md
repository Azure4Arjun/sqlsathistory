## Title: DMX - Data Mining Extensions
## Abstract:
### Data Mining Extensions (DMX) is a language that you can use to create and work with data mining models in Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. You can use DMX to create the structure of new data mining models, to train these models, and to browse, manage, and predict against them. We will work through clustering and forecast examples and populate a relational table using SSIS.
