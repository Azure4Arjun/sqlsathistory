## Title: Visualize Your Transaction Log
## Abstract:
### The SQL transaction log can be a mystery to many DBAs.  We live in the age of visualizations, so let#39;s visualize the log!  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.
