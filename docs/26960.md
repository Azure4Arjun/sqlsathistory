## Speaker: Todd Kleinhans
## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "flythrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.
