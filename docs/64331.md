## Title: Indexing Guidelines
## Abstract:
### This session will discuss the indexes development lifecycle and some guidelines on how to make good indexing decisions.   By understanding the development lifecycle, you will better understand how to build and optimize your indexes over time.  We will also be discussing how to decide what columns to consider when building indexes, and how to ensure those indexes are providing value as your application matures.  Column selectivity will also be discussed.  This session will show how selectivity information can help you determine the best column order when building multi-column indexes.  During this session there will be numerous demos to highlight the concepts being discussed. Additionally, an indexing toolkit (a set of scripts) will be provided to help attendees better manage their indexes.
