## Title: SSIS: Configuring, Deploying and a Little Tuning
## Abstract:
### Typically, you develop SSIS packages on your laptop, desktop or some client machine and then deploy them to a server. In most cases these environments are completely different. They may have different machine names, folders, connection strings, etcâ€¦ To assist in easing the pain of deploying your SSIS packages, SSIS includes a range of options that help you when building your data integration solutions. In this session I will attempt to demystify the usage of Configurations file in your SSIS package with a particular focus on Child and Master package solutions.  In addition, I will discuss the native deployment methods that are available for SSIS packages.  Finally, I will disucss a few methods that can be used to improve the performance.
