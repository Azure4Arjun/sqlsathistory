## Title: Data center migrations  – a focus on the ‘Data’
## Abstract:
### Data center migrations are all the rage these days and the SQL Server DBA is one of the most important accessories to success. I find that approximately 10-20% of all Windows Servers in the business enterprise are SQL Servers.  When an organization makes the decision to move from one data center to another, of all the very important servers that will be migrated, the ones with the company data will be the most watched. Just like any other project, a good plan followed by good execution is required. In this session you’ll learn about the research, design, planning, process, and execution that go into migrating SQL Servers from one data center to another. I’ll go over some lessons learned and discuss whether you go it alone or brings in some help.  I’ll discuss the big options and decisions on migration techniques and methodologies and the pros and cons.  You’ll also hear about the big decisions like keeping the same server names, production downtime, data synchronization  more.
