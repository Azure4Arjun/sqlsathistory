## Title: What Developers Need to Know About The Transaction Log
## Abstract:
### Every database change is tracked in the transaction log. It's an essential component to keeping database transactions atomic and durable.
As workloads increase, the performance and throughput to the transaction log matters. In fact the throughput of the transaction log can become the biggest category of database waits.
We're going to take a close look at the function of the transaction log, the challenges that developers can face because of it and we'll discuss what developers can do to about it.
