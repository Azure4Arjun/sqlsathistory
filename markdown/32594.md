## Speaker: Rob Vettor
## Title: Advance Your Debugging Skills with VS 2010
## Abstract:
### In this session, we’ll …
 
•         Dive deep into the new IntelliTrace feature, which enables you to step back in time within your debugging session and inspect or re-execute code, without having to restart your application.
•         See how to manage large numbers of breakpoints with labeling, searching and filtering.
•         Extend “data tips” by adding comments, notes and strategically “pinning” these resources to maintain their visibility throughout your session.
•         Demonstrate “collaborative debugging,“ by debugging a portion of an application and then exporting breakpoints and labeled data tips, so that others can leverage your effort, without having to start over.
