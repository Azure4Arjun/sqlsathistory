# Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track:  Auditorium
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

# Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 3
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.

# Statistics and Query Optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 1
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
## Abstract:
### There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

# Spatial Data: Cooler Than You'd Think!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 4
## Speaker: Hope Foley
## Title: Spatial Data: Cooler Than You'd Think!
## Abstract:
### Spatial data has been around since 2008 but it should fire it's PR person.  It's too bad that spatial data gets no love, it's actually something that pretty much all SQL Server shops could use.  This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data.  I will use some real world examples to help get the wheels turning on how you can use it within your organization and show how powerful it can be to see your data visually on a map.

# Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 6
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
## Abstract:
### Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in  less than 4 seconds and 1 Million nodes in less than a minute) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  As a finale`, we'll cover a new "pre-aggregated" Hierarchical table structure that answers most of the questions you'd ask of a Hierarchy. You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

# Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#241---Cleveland-2014)
Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track:  Auditorium
## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
## Abstract:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground
## Abstract:
### As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Writing Better Queries with T-SQL Window Functions
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
## Abstract:
### Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
## Abstract:
### Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

Event Date: 08-02-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 6
## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
## Abstract:
### When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.
