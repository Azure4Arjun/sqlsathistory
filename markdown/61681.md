## Speaker: Jim Donahoe
## Title: New Instance, Now what?
## Abstract:
### Congratulations, youâ€™re now our DBA!   A new SQL instance is like a blank canvas, you stare at it and wonder where to start.  As an accidental dba, this session will help you learn how to survive in your new role.

In this session, you will be supplied with the beginning brush strokes to make your server a master piece. To do so, we will review best practices for standard configurations, backups, maintenance, and disaster recovery. 

By the end of this session, you will have developed a pallet of tools to help you create your SQL Server Masterpiece and be able to use it as a print for others.
