## Title: Top 10 Dos and Don’ts for Clustered SQL Server Implementations
## Abstract:
### Whether you are a new DBA or a seasoned veteran, clustered implementations of SQL Server can still vex many in one way or another. Physical, virtual, and cloud-based architectures all have different subtle complexities when it comes to deploying either clustered instances of SQL Server (FCIs) or availability groups (AGs) regardless if you are using an older version or SQL Server 2016. Storage, networking, Active Directory, quorum, the overall underlying Windows Server failover cluster, and more are topics that come up quite often. This session will cut to the chase and concentrate nearly 20 years of experience down into the most relevant aspects of planning, deployment, and administration of clustered implementations that every DBA should know. The ten dos and don’ts presented could not only mean the difference between success and failure, but whether your systems are up or down.
