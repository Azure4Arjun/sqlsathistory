## Title: Graph Databases on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Graph database is type of database that uses graph attributes â€“ edges (or relationships) and nodes (or vertices) and features, to store data. Relationship between nodes are through edges and features (also called properties) hold the values to represent the strength or direction of the edges.

SQL Server 2017 offers graph database capabilities to model many-to-many relationships. The graph relationships are integrated into T-SQL and receive the benefits of using SQL Server as the foundational database management system.

In this session we're going to be looking at the key differences between a standard relational database and a graph database, including what datasets are best suited for each type, and how to work between them.
