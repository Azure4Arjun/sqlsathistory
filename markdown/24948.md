## Title: ”Delivering Reports - Report Manager and Beyond”
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services Report Manager provides a great web platform for managing and delivering many types of reports. We will review delivering reports with Report Manager and look at the options for integrating SSRS as the report presentation engine within web and windows applications. We will also explore creating a standalone application to navigate and display reports using the reporting services database.
