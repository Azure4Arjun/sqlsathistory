## Title: Building a Near-Realtime Operational Dashboard
## Abstract:
### Using Analysis Services, ASP.NET, AJAX callbacks for refresh, Dundas grids and charts, and Notification Services for alerts, this session will show how to integrate a variety of MS technologies to create a state-of-the-art dashboard system. This particular dashboard implementation is currently in use by Norfolk Southern railroad to monitor intermodal shipments. The concepts could be applied to monitoring any operational system. It also shows how cubes can be used for more than just decision support.
