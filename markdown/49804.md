## Title: Using R in SQL Server, Power BI, and Azure ML [EN]
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server, Azure ML, and Power BI suites, you can find nearly anything you need for analyzing your data. SQL Server 2016 closes one of the last gaps - support for statistics beyond basic aggregate functions and support for other mathematical calculations. This is done with support for the R code inside SQL Server Database Engine. This session goes beyond showing the basics, i.e. how to use R in the Database Engine, Power BI and Reporting Services reports, and to enhance Azure ML; it shows and explains also some advanced statistical and matrix calculations.
