## Title: The Power of Caching
## Abstract:
### With the right caching strategy, we can improve our database performance by reducing calls to the database. A look at how to use Redis cache with a .net web application to provide enterprise level performance. While most applications involve a database, that database becomes the bottleneck and caching can improve that bottleneck. We will look at best practices and pitfalls for using Redis cache.

Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.
