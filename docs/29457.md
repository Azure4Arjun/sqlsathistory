## Title: SQL Server 2008 R2 - Moving to the Next Level
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 provided us with many features that developers and database administrators have been asking about for years.  Separate Date and Time data types, sparse columns, FILESTREAM and compression for both data and backups have made the platform better than ever.  So how do you build on a platform that strong?  By adding features like multi-server management, application management and complex event processing, of course.  Come along with me as we explore these new features with the August CTP of SQL Server 2008 R2.
