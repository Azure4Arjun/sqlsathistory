## Title: Data Engineering - The Hottest New Job
## Abstract:
### I bet you thought all the cool kids were the "data scientists"...  Be even cooler and be a data engineer!  You can't have any predictions or cool visualizations without having the data in a useful form.  In this session we will use Azure Databricks with Spark SQL to transform data and put it into a form that BI tools can handle with ease.  Come see how you can enable data scientists and be part of the cool kid club!
