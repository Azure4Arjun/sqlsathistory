## Speaker: Kevin Goff
## Title: SSRS 2008R2 Reporting Gallery
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, I'll show 10 rather cool looking reports created in SSRS 2008R2 - everything from sparklines to heat maps, from Tablix-drilldown reports to advanced charts, from performance gauges to new page/group control features in R2.  Since no presentation can cover the creation of all ten, I'll let the majority of the audience decide which to cover.
