## Speaker: Gavin Campbell
## Title: Effective Unit Testing for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### There are tools available from Microsoft, as well as from a number of third party vendors, to ease the process of integrating database unit testing into your development environments and your continuous delivery pipeline.

This session isn't about any of those tools, but is an attempt to get back to basics - with the open source tSQLt framework - and address questions such as 

 Why is database unit testing difficult?
 What do I need to test?
 What do I not need to test?
What does a "good" unit test look like?
What tests should I be writing anwyay?

This session will incorporate real-life experiences with tSQLt, as well as lessons that can be learned from other testing framworks and other programming languages.
