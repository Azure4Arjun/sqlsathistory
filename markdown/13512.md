## Title: Market Basket Analysis
## Abstract:
### Cross-selling is one of the best ways how to increase your sales. In order to know what products to offer together, you need to do a market basket analysis. Many solutions still use all kinds of distinct count queries, including T-SQL queries from SQL Server data, MDX queries from Analysis Services Dimensional models, or DAX queries from PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular data. However, once you know how to perform market basket analysis with data mining, you will forget on all other techniques. DMX queries will blow away other language queries. In this session, you are going to learn which data mining algorithms you should use for market basket analysis, how they work, and how you can efficiently use them in production.
