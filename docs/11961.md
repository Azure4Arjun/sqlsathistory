## Title: Building a SSIS Business Rules Engine
## Abstract:
### While DQS in SQL Server 2012 is a powerful tool for enforcing data quality through business rules, often times the time and complexity it takes to set-up is overkill for more mundane common problems. This session will focus on implementing a business rules engine in a SSIS custom component. A flexible, metadata-driven solution will be discussed including considerations for implementation as a custom SSIS component.
