## Title: Let's do some IoT stuff with an Arduino and Azure Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### IoT for Internet of Things, the new buzzword that englobes everything we can do when an item has sensors and an internet connection!

In this session we'll configure an Arduino board, one of the open source items with the largest community, get some reading from its sensors and stream them through Azure Stream Analytics for Real Time Dashboarding - with some luck directly in Power BI!
