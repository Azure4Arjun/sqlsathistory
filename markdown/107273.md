## Title: Azure Data Factory - how to implement incremental loads for PARQUET
## Abstract:
### Incremental loads in a DWH environment is a key process everyone needs to consider. PARQUET in data lake by default does not implement in-place updates which makes delta loading quite a challenge. Of course there is the delta lake, but what if we are still not ready to go there? Join me in the session to review the different options we have for implementing incremental loads in a data lake with parquet files.
