## Title: Configuring AlwaysOn Availability Groups exclusively in Azure, using IaaS.
## Abstract:
### Both Availability Groups and Azure are big talking points when it comes to SQL Server. Deploying Availability Groups to Azure, requires an understanding of the infrastructure-based components that support an SQL Server install. In this session, we go beyond the traditional database silo, as we walk through all the steps required to successfully configure AlwaysOn Availability groups, exclusively in Azure.
