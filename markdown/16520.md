## Title: Getting Started with SSAS Tabular Cubes
## Abstract:
### Prior to the release of SQL Server 2012, Business Intelligence Developers had a single option when creating cubes in Analysis Services, the Multidimensional Model.  Now, Microsoft has added the Tabular Model to Analysis Services which opens up many new and exciting possibilities.

In this session, we'll discuss the features and benefits of the Tabular Model and draw comparisons to the Multidimensional Model.  We'll also review scenarios when implementing a Tabular cube may be a better choice than Multidimensional.  The presentation will conclude with a demo of basic Tabular cube functionality.
