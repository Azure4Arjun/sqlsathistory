## Title: Getting started with PowerShell - the hands on 101 session
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover off the different elements that make PowerShell a language that is built upon making itself easier to discover.
We will cover Functions, Aliases, Help Topics, Modules, Cmdlets, Objects, Methods and Properties and how understanding these different aspects makes your time in PowerShell much simpler to get to grips with and can really help you adopt the language in a much more efficient way going forward.

This session should leave you with a greater understanding of the PowerShell Language and give you the ability to go and discover more of the language and how it works.
