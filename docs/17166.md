## Title: Data Driven Branding for SSRS
## Abstract:
### Ever had marketing send out that email saying that they are re-branding the company with new colours and fonts, normally not a problem until they mention that the 300+ SSRS reports need to be changed too...

This session will show you how to make use of SSRS project templates, and built in data sets, variable, expressions and a bit of modification to the SSRS database to help make these sorts of requests a simple matter of updating some values in a database. As opposed to pulling the reports out of source control before modifying them and trying to get a deployment scheduled.
