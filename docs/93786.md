## Title: Survival of the Fittest:  Matching Approaches for Golden Record

So how do you overcome those challenges? Join us for a lunch and learn presentation where we’ll cover all of that and more!

 

Key takeaways:

Problems and implications of duplicate data
Real-world applications of deduplication within SQL Server
What makes a golden record and how data survives the process
