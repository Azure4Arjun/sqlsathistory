## Speaker: Aaron Nelson
## Title: PowerShell 2.0 Beyond the Dirty Dozen
## Abstract:
### Now that you’ve learned the basics of PowerShell we’ll dive a little deeper and learn to develop scripts that help you get the most out of SQL Server.  We’ll take a look at advanced functions, event logging and error handling.  Then put everything together in a nice package and create our own modules to deploy to profiles across our entire SQL Server environment.
