## Speaker: Joe Toscano
## Title: Table Partitioning:  Implementing a sliding window
## Abstract:
### In this session Joe will first discuss the benefits and requirements of table partitioning in SQL 2008 and then go through the planning and implementation steps of partitioning an 11 million row sample table. Once complete, we will then review in detail our sliding window requirements and see exactly how the partitioning toolbox commands (Split, Merge  Switch) can be used to implement our scenario. You will get to see the actual partitioning code and the sliding window code. No prior table partitioning experience is assumed.
