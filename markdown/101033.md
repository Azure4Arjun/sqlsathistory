## Title: Top 5 Skills that a DBA will need in 2020
## Abstract:
### It’s the year 2020 about ten years ago many people were writing about the demise of the DBA and how they won’t be around in ten years time. As we move into a new decade, and those ten years have passed the DBA role is still alive and kicking. Albeit, it has evolved in the last ten years and it has changed considerably since I started my career in the early 2000s.
In this session we will look at what skills you would expect a DBA to have in 2010 and compare it to what they will need in 2020. No doubt we will be covering:
•	New versions of SQL Server
•	Automation and PowerShell
•	Continuous integration
•	Cloud technology
•	Maybe some non-technical skills too
If you want to get my take on what skills a DBA needs to have in the Roaring 20s then this session is for you.
