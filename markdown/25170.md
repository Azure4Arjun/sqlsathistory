## Speaker: JK Wood
## Title: NULL: A Love Story
## Abstract:
### NULL - an unknown value. At least, that's what it's SUPPOSED to be. The problem is, NULL is often treated differently based on what you're doing - even equality is suspect. Join JK as he works on demystifying NULLs in the database, looking at how they interact with various queries and how to work around and with the idiosyncrasies of this sometimes misunderstood concept.
