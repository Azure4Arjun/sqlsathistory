## Title: SSRS Episode  2016 - The Reports Awaken!
## Abstract:
### In an IT Department far, far away...
SSRS in the BI Galaxy has vanished. Due to this absence, other non-sinister reporting tools have risen from the ashes of this Global Industry and will not rest until SSRS 2016, the latest Reporting tool, has been defeated. With the support of brave BI developers like yourself, we will lead the new way of BI reporting in the future. Armed with the latest in Paginated and Mobile Reports, it is time to restore peace and justice in the BI Galaxy that depends on us!
In English, we're going to take a look at the latest edition for SQL Server Reporting Services.
