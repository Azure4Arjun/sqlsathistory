## Speaker: Daniel Glenn
## Title: Keeping up with change in Office 365
## Abstract:
### Every month there are dozens of changes made throughout the services in Microsoft 365. The changes can bring brand new features, but also change aspects on which your business solutions are based.  
How do you stay informed about the changes and prepare your environment for all the updates? How can you keep your users up-to-date with the features that are available and manage the process of change?
 
During this session, we will discuss how IT Pros and collaboration enablers can keep up with all the changes, promote adoption with your users, and help your organization stay focused on what you do best.
