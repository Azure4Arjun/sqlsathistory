## Speaker: Craig Utley
## Title: Why BI Projects Fail--And What You Can Do About It
## Abstract:
### Is your organization planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution? Data warehousing projects, like many large IT projects, have high failure rates. While the exact rate of failure for data warehousing projects is difficult to pin down, the causes of these failures fall into a small number of categories. It is obviously possible to successfully complete a data warehousing project and deliver value to the business. Craig Utley has seen Microsoft BI solutions in various states of completeness at over 30 companies worldwide and has seen some awesome successes and some spectacular failures. This session addresses the reasons data warehousing projects fail and how you can succeed in overcoming these obstacles.

## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
## Abstract:
### Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.

# Hardware 301: Diving Deeper into Database Hardware
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#145---Nashville-2012)
Event Date: 13-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Mixed Sessions
## Speaker: Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 301: Diving Deeper into Database Hardware
## Abstract:
### Making the right hardware selection decisions is extremely important for database scalability. Having properly sized and configured hardware can both increase application performance and reduce capital expenses dramatically. Unfortunately, there are so many different choices and options available when it comes to selecting hardware and storage subsystems, it is very easy to make bad choices based on outmoded conventional wisdom. This session will give you a framework for how to pick the right hardware and storage subsystem for your workload type. You will learn how to evaluate and compare key hardware components, such as processors, chipsets, and memory.

# Custom SQL Server Transaction Log Shipping
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#145---Nashville-2012)
Event Date: 13-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: J.D. Pellerin
## Title: Custom SQL Server Transaction Log Shipping
## Abstract:
### Using a custom database transaction log shipping process instead of the built in SQL Server transaction log shipping component.  Custom database transaction log shipping has several advantages, including:
a)  The SQL Server instances need not have any connectivity to one another
b)   Applying of the transaction log backups can be suspended for weeks and then enabled, with the log shipped database being brought as
          current as the most recent transaction log backup.
      While transaction log backups are suspended, the Log Shipped Database can be placed in standby/Read Only mode, for querying.
c)  Using custom database transaction log shipping also allows more control over each part of the process.

## Speaker: Jon Boulineau
## Title: T-SQL: Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language.  Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply?  In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.

## Speaker: Sanil Mhatre
## Title: Parameter sniffing - make it work for you !
## Abstract:
### Parameter Sniffing is usually thought of as the bad guy, in association with a performance problem in your database. Contrary to the popular belief, Parameter Sniffing is usually the good guy, continuously working under the hood to help your database applications run faster. However, it can sometimes go wrong, causing severe performance degradation of your queries. 
In this session we will discuss the workings of Parameter Sniffing and demonstrate how it helps improve the performance of your database applications. We will also explore how Parameter Sniffing can go wrong and its impact. Several ways to fix bad Parameter Sniffing will be demonstrated to help make an appropriate choice for your scenario.

## Abstract:
### Recent major security breaches have not only exposed customer data, but also the system vulnerabilities DBAs must overcome daily. As data protection is a DBA’s primary responsibility, establishing an impenetrable environment to host the data is the first step towards risk-free security. How can DBAs ensure SQL Servers are fortified against the latest threats and vulnerabilities? In this session, we will go through the process of hardening your SQL Server from attack from Windows Server to the database level step-by-step. I will share will share with you how establish security baselines and monitor for changes to your security foundation.

## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Abstract:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Title: Deeper into Tabular Models - M-to-M and the "W"
## Abstract:
### You will need to understand how many-to-many relationships work in tabular models. While different than dimensional models, you can be successful in getting many of the behaviors you will need. Understanding how filters propagate is necessary requisite. We will use a "W" diagram to understand how this occurs in tabular models. Then we will learn how to force filter propagation, called cross-filtering. Then we will cross-filter conditionally, based on what the user has chosen for filters. If time permits we will also learn how to handle large numbers of fact rows, both in development and production.

# Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#145---Nashville-2012)
Event Date: 13-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice
## Abstract:
### A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we will gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.
