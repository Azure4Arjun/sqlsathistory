## Title: Getting Started with .NET Core
## Abstract:
### Heard of .NET Core, but not taken the time to look in to it? Started looking at it, but been discouraged by the seemingly endless stream of breaking changes to the architecture? Played around with it, but want to know what the framework code you're typing is actually doing? This talk aims to answer some of your questions about .NET Core, what it is, how it's structured, middleware, and the differences between it and the .NET Framework. We'll also have a brief introduction to ASP.NET Core.
