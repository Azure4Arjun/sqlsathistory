## Title: SQL Server Security for Developers
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has a robust and granular system for granting and denying access to users, but all too often we see applications running as DBO or even sysadmin. Why? Part of is that same granular system can be overwhelming and part is that many developers don't see the point in applying such granular security. In this introductory level presentation we'll start at the beginning with creating and managing logins, take a quick look at system roles, and then get into the nitty gritty of users and roles and permissions at the database level. Along the way we'll talk about why its so important to set security at the database and not just rely on the application enforced security.
