## Title: Will SQL Server Standard edition meet your needs?
## Abstract:
### Working in large Enterprise environments as an employee is a challenge on the best of days. Getting the company to purchase the proper software is I believe a difficult task for even the most seasoned DBAs. Having started at my 3rd large Enterprise I have come to learn that each one manages the purse strings in their own manner. I have always been graced with corporate licenses that allowed me to install Enterprise Editions of SQL Server across the board. I am happy to say that the pendulum has swung and I am now tasked with justifying my SQL Server licenses. This has been a positive event for me that I would like to share with you. This session will share with you some of my current experiences with Standard and Enterprise Editions of SQL Server.  You will be armed with some facts that can help you decide Standard or Enterprise edition so that you can meet the projects objectives, your SLAs and most importantly justify the cost of your SQL Server license.
