## Title: ORMs: the good, the bad and the ugly
## Abstract:
### ORM technologies can assist the developersâ€™ work with a simplified data access layer and nobody questions their usefulness any more: ORMs are here to stay. On the other hand, DBAs often get frustrated when ORMs are used to access data, because many tools in their belt turn out being ineffective.
Developers and DBAs are focused on different goals and finding a balance between ease of development and performance can be an overwhelming challenge, or even turn into a continuous and unproductive blamestorm.
In this session we will walk through some common performance issues in ORM technologies and we will try to address them, hoping to bridge the notorious gap between developers and DBAs.
