## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Tracking Logins with an Extended-Events-Driven Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Using Extended Events, Powershell, TSQL, MDX, DAX and Excel we will build a SSAS MD and Tabular Cube that allows you to track SQL Server Logins  that can be sliced and diced per Hour, Server, User, Host, Connection String and Database.

This session touches on multiple advanced topics that you can use individually, but together, make for a powerful SQL Security Auditing Tool not found anywhere else.
