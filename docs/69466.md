## Speaker: Bill Wilder
## Title: Azure SQL Database â€“ not just a cloud version of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server originally shipped in 1989. A full 20 years later, in 2009, Microsoft announced SQL Azure, currently known as Azure SQL Database. What is it? Is Azure SQL Database a hosted version of SQL Server? A subset? A superset? Actually, none of those simple explanations really capture it. Come join cloud computing veteran Bill Wilder to dig into the topic and go over the key differences between them, understand your cloud options, with a focus on how you would put Azure SQL Database to work today, including deploying, managing, securing, scaling, and DR enabling.

By the end of this session you should have a feel for how your SQL Server skills transfer to Azure SQL Database, which aspects of management  control Microsoft takes on, and how to use the toolbox of goodies for encryption, threat detection, DR, and global scale.
