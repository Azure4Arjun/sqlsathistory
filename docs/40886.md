## Title: Automatic sharding  in SQL - Reality or Myth?
## Abstract:
### Have you ever started developing a product and found out that none of the available databases arenâ€™t suitable for your use case?  

What was your next step? In our case we were crazy enough to create our own database engine. In this session I will present our problem and what led us to the creation of new database engine. We will have a quick overview of how database engine is working and why it is the most suitable database for our case. Maybe you will find out that it may suit also for your needs. A closer look will also explain how our database engine handles automatic shading.
