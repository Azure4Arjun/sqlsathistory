## Title: Creating a Performance Monitoring Solution for SQL Server BI Suite
## Abstract:
### These talks discuss using the native Windows performance tools System Monitor and WMI technology to create logs that track the overall performance of SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server. This will be a deep dive into Windows Performance Monitoring and WMI tools that are native to all Windows Operating Systems and how they can be used to track and monitor your SQL applications. I will discuss memory utilization, counters, WMI classes, and threading that is collected during SQL operations within the Windows OS. I will also show you how to collect this data manually or via automated schedule and export it for later evaluation or logging
