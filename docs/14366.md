## Title: Lies, Damned Lies And Statistics
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what the things called statistics are, why they're important and what needs to be done to maintain them? If so, this session is for you! In this session well take a look at what statistics are and why SQL keeps them; at how SQL maintains them and under what circumstances that maintenance is insufficient; and well look at the problems that result when they are inaccurate. Finally well cover some suggestions and options around maintenance of statistics when the automatic maintenance is not sufficient.
