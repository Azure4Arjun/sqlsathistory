## Title: Exploring Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### Getting started reading execution plans is very straight forward. The real issue is understanding the plans as they grow in size and complexity. This session will show you how to explore the nooks and crannies of an execution plan in order to more easily find the necessary information needed to make what the plan is telling you crystal clear. The information presented here will better empower you to traverse the execution plans youâ€™ll see on your own servers. That knowledge will make it possible to more efficiently and accurately tune and troubleshoot your queries.
