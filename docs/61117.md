## Speaker: Paul Nielsen
## Title: So you want to launch a software company
## Abstract:
### You love working with people and you love delivering solutions, and you want to be your own boss. You think you have a great idea and you're ready to jump. The startup space is a completely different world. MVP means Minimum Viable Product. I took that plunge and converted my SQL MPV to a startup MVP. In this lesson I'll pass on as much as possible about launching a software startup - beginning with the Business Model Canvass. (note: I'm also the chair of Colorado Springs Startup Week and on the board of Peak Startup)
