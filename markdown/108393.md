## Speaker: Damian Widera
## Title: Quantum computing explained with demos!
## Abstract:
### This talk is inspired by the quantum revolution we will see in a moment.
I would like to introduce the topics:
- reminder why basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors) is important
- qbits, superposition, and quantum logic gates
- Show the simplest problem where a quantum computer outperforms classical methods

If time permits - quantum entanglement

I will do demos implemented in Q# with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.

I do not assume any special knowledge, but if you know basic linear algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication) than the topic will be more easily understand!
