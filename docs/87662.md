## Title: Cardinality Estimation Issues with Large Tables
## Abstract:
### In this session, you will see a simple query with two large tables that runs loo long with high memory grants and a very bad execution plan although preconditions for an optimal execution are fulfilled: indexes on JOIN columns exist, statistics are up-to-date, all new features and improvements are enabled (SQL Server 2017 CU 10 or SQL Server 2019 CTP2).

You’ll see how developer usually workaround this issue, when this is a good idea and when it’s not, and we’ll consider which technical and logical mistakes are made in the process of solving this issue.

Of course, you’ll see why this happens only when working with large tables, what is different in the world of large tables, and how to solve this issue by identifying and eliminating the root cause and not dealing with consequences only.

Attendees should be familiar with the process and components involved in the generation of an execution plan in SQL Server.
