## Title: AlwaysOn Live Deployment
## Abstract:
### This session is 90% live demonstrations.  I'll walk you through a complete AlwaysOn deployment.  You will see firsthand how to install and configure an AlwaysOn Failover Cluster.  I'll also show you how to setup an AlwaysOn Availability Group across 5 nodes using both the GUI and T-SQL so you know why and when to use each method.  I'll finish up by showing how you can connect to a readable secondary.
