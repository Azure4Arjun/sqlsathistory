## Speaker: Phillip Seamark
## Title: Wacky DAX
## Abstract:
### Did you know the DAX language is far more capable than merely running a SUM over a column, or counting rows in a table? DAX sits on top of one of the fastest databases around, and this session will explore some unusual and creative scenarios that you previously would have thought as not possible using just DAX.

The session will aim to reset your understanding of what is possible in DAX by walking through some interesting code highlights from a recent series of games built using DAX. Each game pushes and explores different boundaries in DAX and will attempt to show just where those lines are.

The session will hopefully inspire you to add some creative and exciting techniques to your own DAX based data models.
