## Title: Data Vault Data Warehouse Architecture
## Abstract:
### Data vault is a compelling architecture for an enterprise data warehouse using SQL Server 2012.  A well designed data vault data warehouse facilitates fast, efficient and maintainable population of a data mart.  SQL Server 2012 introduces column store indexes and the Vertipaq engine.  Because the Vertipaq engine allows you to use a dimensional model or a relational model, I will argue that a data vault design is the best architecture for your data warehouse.   In this session we will introduce you to the data vault architecture, the new modeling capabilities of Vertipaq, compare the performance of the OLAP engine vs the Tabular engine and discuss data warehouse design options to best leverage column store indexes.
