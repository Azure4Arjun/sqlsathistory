## Title: Strong Architecture and Entity Framework Code First - It's Possible!
## Abstract:
### Code-first database generation has a reputation as a dirty word. In this session, we'll explore ways to integrate Entity Framework Code First with a well-architected application. Topics covered will include unit testing, (Yes, you can unit test a database!) dependency injection, transaction scoping, separation of concerns, and repeatable patterns for model generation.
