## Title: Database lifecycle with Visual Studio 2010 and TFS
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of manually integrating scripts before every release, inadequate history of changes to database objects or lack of consistent and automated unit testing for SQL Server objects?
We will learn how we can use Visual Studio 2010 Database Project and Team Foundation Server for managing lifecycle of our database projects. Session will cover basic rules for managing tables, views and stored procedures in Visual Studio project, using Team Foundation Server source control and creating unit tests.
We will also use TFS build agent to automate creation of the differential SQL scripts, deploying it to test/development environment and execution of defined unit tests.
Finally we will create deliverables for release.
