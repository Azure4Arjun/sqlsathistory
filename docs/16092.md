## Title: Automating Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### Many SQL Server performance issues can be solved with the information from the DMVs, even if it is collected only after the occurrence. But why was it fine yesterday and a problem today? On modern server systems, problems may be infrequent, but they do still occur. And so we may have neglected to collect data on a routine basis. It is important to collect sufficient information to diagnose and a resolve a problem. Too many third party tools to stop after identifying a problem on the presumption that the DBAâ€™s responsibility ends with passing this information to someone else. I have automated the collection and partial analysis of index usage, query execution statistics and executions plans in my tool ExecStats.
