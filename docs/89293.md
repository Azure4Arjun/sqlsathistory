## Title: Azure IoT: An interactive demo
## Abstract:
### The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most talked about emerging technologies nowadays. But what is it and how can it help by business? Most importantly, how do I get started? In this presentation, we will do an interactive demo with a Raspberry PI and a Microsoft Sphere MCU along with several sensors and components to capture and analyze data from a connected device in Azure IoT Hub and IoT Central. Learn how to connect, monitor and manage connected devices using Azure IoT Hub. We will also discuss how Azure IoT Edge can simplify secure deployment of complex event processing, ML, and AI functionality to connected devices to reduce the latency of decision making.
