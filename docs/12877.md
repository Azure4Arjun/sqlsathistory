## Speaker: Diana Betancourt
## Title: A DiBA guide to Database Standards
## Abstract:
### If you work with SQL Server, either as a developer, Dev/DBA, or accidental DBA, we are all DiBA's! but in order to keep that status and not run into "fire drill" mode, you need to make sure you set the ground to keep on looking good. This session will focus on how to set your Database Server environment in a way that will switch you from reactive to proactive mode. And I will demo its implementation via Policy Based Management.
