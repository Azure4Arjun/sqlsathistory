## Title: Running SQL Server in Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS)
## Abstract:
### Whether you're a developer who prefers SQL Server behind the scenes, or a DBA who is responsible for its care and feeding, RDS fits the bill nicely when it's time to move your databases to the cloud. There are many benefits from letting Amazon handle your database infrastructure, but managing your SQL Server in RDS is a little different from hosting it on your own hardware. Some things work differently from what you're used to, and there are a number of limitations that you should be aware of before diving in. 

In this session I will outline a number of the benefits of running your databases in the Amazon cloud. I will also highlight some of the limitations and differences that you'll encounter there. Whether you are a total beginner or a seasoned SQL Server veteran, if you're new to Amazon RDS, then this session is for you.
