## Title: Machine Learning Services in SQL Server, Featuring Dinosaurs!
## Abstract:
### When Machine Learning Services in SQL Server 2017 was announced, I was really impressed with the potential of the idea: Bringing the algorithm right to the data! No more fiddly and expensive data pipelines!

I wanted to investigate what this would look like in practice, to see if it was a good fit for Xero's use cases.

In this session, I'll give a brief overview of the results of my investigation, demonstrate what using R for machine learning in SQL Server looks like, and give some opinions on how that fits with Xero's needs. And because we're all sick of the usual toy datasets, I'll be using data about dinosaurs!
