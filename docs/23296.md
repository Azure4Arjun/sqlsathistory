## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!
## Abstract:
### In a world...where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked...one man...WILL. GET. EVEN. In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up. Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, cursors and missing WHERE clauses, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem. And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!
