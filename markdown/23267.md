## Title: Harvesting Web Data Using Power Query  Other Tools
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover the basics of using Power Query + other tools to explore XML data from the SQL Saturday website.  We will look at lesser-known features like XML feeds, harvesting data from other websites, and social media sources. We'll also use open source tools like Curl (a command line tool for downloading URLs) to augment the gathering of web data.  We'll also demonstrate importing data into SQL Server for use with other Power BI components.
