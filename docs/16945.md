## Title: A differentiated approach for processing OLAP cubes dynamically
## Abstract:
### Time windows for refreshing the data inside OLAP cubes are getting shorter and shorter because business users have to take more complex decisions based on the information provided by the cubes. Consequently, there is a need for rethinking the process of processing OLAP cubes in a way that it will fulfil these new demands for providing the data faster. That’s the reason why we present an incremental and dynamic approach for processing OLAP cubes which is based on cube partitioning and C# code for defining the sections of the cube that need to be reprocessed. Based on our experimentations, we can decrease the amount of time needed for processing the cubes to the magnitude of seconds or a few minutes, so we are practically providing a real time cube without needing a complex ETL infrastructure.
