## Title: Introduction to SQL Server 2017 for Linux
## Abstract:
### Microsoft surprised a lot of people with the announcement that SQL Server is going to be released for Linux. And there we have it - preview releases available in public are regularly delivered, working great and fast.
On my session I'll show details of solution that allowed this idea to come true. We'll see how to install, use and administer Linux version of SQL Server. We'll see it working as a service and in Docker containers. I'll give you details of why the second option is really interesting, or to say it more clearly - groundbreaking.
In addition to slides you're going to see quite a bit of T-SQL and bash code, terminal windows, Visual Studio Code, tools that are familiar to you and new stuff as well.
