## Title: Object Level Recovery Made Easy
## Abstract:
### Have you ever found yourself in a situation where data mysteriously disappears from your database? Or a stored procedure or function was altered without your knowledge.How do I recover and get back to the original state?Recovering data and/or database code can be a frustrating and time-consuming effort without the proper tools.In this session, I will show how to recover data and/or database code using native SQL Server tools.Do I have space to restore a copy of the database, do SLAs allow me to do this now or after hours, etc.Then I will show how LiteSpeed for SQL Server's Object Level Recovery (OLR) functionality can simplify the process and get back to the original database state in a fraction of the time.The result is you are the hero and everyone is happy.
