## Title: What R You Analyzing
## Abstract:
### R has become one of the leading analysis tools for developers and data scientists alike. 

However, in order for R to do its magic it needs data so historically we have imported data from various sources, SQL Server being one of those sources. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has embedded R in the SQL engine. Yes, we do now have access to R natively in SQL Server.
