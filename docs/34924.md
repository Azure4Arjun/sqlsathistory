## Title: Defensive database programming
## Abstract:
### I will explain what is defensive database programming, what are its advantages, and provide several simple real life examples that show how to use it. I will demonstrate how to develop robust Transact SQL code that correctly works in high concurrency environments, gracefully handles cases of unintended use, and is easy to maintain in changing environments.
