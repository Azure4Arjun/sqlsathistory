## Title: Experts should work with facts, not guesstimates
## Abstract:
### Experts should work with facts, not guesstimates â€“ how you learn to love large scale SQL Server consolidation projects

Have you ever been struggling with the consolidation or migration planning of a sizable SQL Server platform? Traditional data platform capacity planning contains a lot of time consuming manual work and is often based on rough estimates. It is seen more as a task for the data platform architect than a mathematical challenge. The truth is: It is both. Find out how to achieve highly automatized, perfectly optimized plan, based on facts rather than guesswork!

Speaker: Jani K. Savolainen. Founder  CTO @ DB Pro.
