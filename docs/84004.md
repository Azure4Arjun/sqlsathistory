## Title: SQL Server docker containers from the development to the production
## Abstract:
### The Docker democratisation process has begun with developers.  
Nowadays containers are part of the CI/CD pipeline and Microsoft kept up by providing a support for MSSQL databases on Docker regardless the underlying operating system and the environment context as well. 

In this session, I propose you a feedback about the first steps and challenges we had to take up in the docker world for both database development and production scenarios.
