## Title: MI6 Secrets - Data Security For Developers
## Abstract:
### If you're a developer, this is for you (DBAs should already know this!)...
Here is your chance to learn how to turn business logic into database objects.
Learn about SQL Server's data security mechanisms and implement multi-tiered data access with business rules and roles, make your app/database immune to infrastructure changes (like scaling from single server into clustered or cloud) and your boss' moods in the future, and avoid SQL injection and other security and app coding bugs using stored procedures and database server side logic.
Session suited for developers and students (padawan level).
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.
