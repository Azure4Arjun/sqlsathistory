## Title: How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.
