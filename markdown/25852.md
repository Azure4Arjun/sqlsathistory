## Title: What's in your toolbelt?
## Abstract:
### This session is intended to cover some basic database administration tasks and some different approaches to monitoring, deployment, and scripting.  We'll use the Red Gate Toolbelt to address some basic problems, but we'll also discuss these challenges from a more general layer.  We'll also cover some basic performance tuning, and discuss how baseline analysis can help in quickly identifying problems.
