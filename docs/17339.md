## Speaker: Jonathan Allen
## Title: LogParser-quicker than SSIS, easier than BCP
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce people to a free tool from Microsoft that will speed up adhoc data import processes and file parsing among other data manipulation uses. LogParser uses a SQL-like query language to work with data in many formats (CSV, IISW3C, HTML, XML, ADS, REG, EVT, BIN and many more) and can convert the data into may outputs types (CSV, NAT, SQL, W3C, XML etc). It has many uses and can be employed in many ways to assist a busy DBA.
