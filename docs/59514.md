## Title: Deadlock, Block  Two Smoking Barrels: Breaking Down Blocking and Deadlocks
## Abstract:
### While blocking and deadlocks are part of the territory for a DBA, dealing with them can be another story. In this session we will break down locking types, capturing and identifying deadlocks and the code behind them, and things you can do to resolve and prevent blocking and deadlocks. If you are frequently dealing with deadlocks in your databases this session is for you.
