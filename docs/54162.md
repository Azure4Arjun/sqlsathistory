## Title: Execution Plans End-to-End in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This session examines in depth the Execution Plans on SQL Server. To go beyond the basics such as how to reading an Execution Plan or detecting Index Scans or Lookups, you must acquire a deeper understanding of how the Query Optimizer builds the optimal Execution Plan and how you can influence the choice of a particular index or a particular join operator, up to force a particular Execution Plan without changing the query text. Finally, we will explore the Plan Cache memory area where SQL Server stores Execution Plans.
