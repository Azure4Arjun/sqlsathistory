## Title: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing Primer
## Abstract:
### Your CIO's top priority in 2010 is probably Business Intelligence. If you don't know what BI is, or are trying to deliver it directly from your OLTP database, you need to find out what you're getting into.  BI is all about helping your business users make better decisions, faster. Find out what it will take to deliver what your CIO is asking for.
BI from your OLTP database has problems - it requires technical knowledge of your data model, compromises your line of business application responsiveness, and won't perform well. The solution to all of those issues is to construct a Data Warehouse based on Dimensional Modeling. I'll show you why normalized OLTP databases have problems supporting BI, and how Kimball method Data Warehouses don't.
