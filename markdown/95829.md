## Speaker: Magnus Ahlkvist
## Title: Statistics, an unreliable friend.
## Abstract:
### You learned that your statistics should be regularly updated. You even implemented Ola Hallengren's maintenance scripts. That should be enough, right? What if it's not?
Join me on some head-ache, a dive into statistics histograms, fun with flags and a praise to the evolution of SQL Server optimizer.
Much of this session is about the "ascending key problem", and how Microsoft have made shanges to the SQL Server optimizer to improve, but not completely eliminate the problem.
