## Title: Querying JSON in Azure Data Lake with USQL
## Abstract:
### A low cost place to park your JSON data is in Microsoft's Azure Data Lake, a cloud repository for a variety of data.   But how do you query this data?  You can use Hadoop stack tools like Hive. Or why not put your SQL skills to use and write USQL?  USQL is an ANSI SQL like language for querying data in the Azure Data Lake.  After I give a quick demonstration as to how you can read a CSV file,  I will demonstrate how to use a custom Extractor to read JSON files.  We will look at the C# code already built to read these files.  I will demonstrate how to deploy this code.  And finally we will look at how to actually extract the data.  Data is expanding at a dizzying speed.  It is helpful to have up to date tools to handle new kinds of data.
