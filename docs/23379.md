## Title: Self-Service Business Analytics in 2013
## Abstract:
### In this session, I make the case for Self-Service Analytics as one part of a broader reporting and analytics strategy. On its own, Self-Service Analytics struggles to deliver business users the insights they need, but when combined with a corporate BI platform, the power of Self-Service Analytics shines, and the often toxic relationship between the IT department and the Business changes to one of mutual respect and working together to achieve common goals. After laying the foundations, we'll launch into a range of demos covering PerformancePoint dashboards, SSRS Report Alerts, Report Builder Report Parts, Power View, Pivot  PowerPivot. All demos will show how corporate BI solutions can be extended and enhanced with Self-Service Analytics.
