## Title: Azure Functions and Automation: The SQL Agent in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Microsoft's Platform as a Service solution,  SQL Azure is a compelling solution for many who don't want to manage their own highly available SQL implementation. SQL Azure however does not replicate all of the services of on-premesis SQL, and one of these missing is the SQL Agent. This session looks at what alternatives exist for running and managing SQL jobs in Azure without SQL agent. In particular we will focus on Azure Automation and Azure Functions. The presentation will include a brief overview of the two services and how they are applicable to SQL workloads, followed by a demo of creating and running a SQL job.
