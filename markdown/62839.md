## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: SELECT Provider FROM Cloud
## Abstract:
### Are you starting to think that this cloud thing may actually take off?  Perhaps it has become your responsibility to look for a cloud provider to meet the data needs of your employer/client or you want to be ready in case someone asks.  In this session, we will spend a few moments defining Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) before moving on to a brief discussion regarding cloud objections and misconceptions.  Finally, we reach our destination, a conversation based in the classic high school essay test question “Compare and Contrast” concerning data centric services in AWS and Azure.  The focus of this session is available features not necessarily how to use them.
