## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Hey Ma, Watch This: Useless and Dangerous Tricks
## Abstract:
### If you want useful stuff, go to another session.  If you're looking for things to do on your production server, you're in the wrong place.  Brent will be running around with scissors, doing all kinds of oddball T-SQL stunts that have no business in the business world.  If you're the kind of person who loves using a number after the GO statement (like GO 10), then you'll love this session.
