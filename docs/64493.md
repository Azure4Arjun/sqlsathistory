## Title: Power up SSRS with Power BI and other new enhancements
## Abstract:
### SSRS 2016 provides a modern, on-premises solution for enterprise reporting and mobile business intelligence. 

Will start off by demonstrating recent technical previews that support hosting Power BI reports (.PBIX) in SSRS. 

Then also review and demonstrate the new Mobile Reports, KPIs and Paginated reports. The new Mobile Report publisher produces stunning dashboards that can be viewed on any device (iOS, Android and Windows). Other enhancements include, parameters can now be positioned across more than two columns and custom branding your SSRS portal's with your choice of colors and logo.
