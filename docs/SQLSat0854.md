## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Azure Machine Learning for the absolute beginner
## Abstract:
### Machine learning is one of the hottest trends on the market. According to the popular belief, machine learning will help you do everything from water your plants to help run your multi-million dollar company. Some of the hype is true, much of it is false.  But what IS machine learning - really? How can it be used? What questions can it answer? Har hard is it to get started?
Join Alexander for a session that will give you a thorough overview of what machine learning tools are available in Azure, how to actually find any use for machine learning, what preconceptions are wrong and how to get started on your first machine learning project.

# Azure SQL and Automation, how to keep your database up-to-speed in the cloud
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Antonio Abalos Castillo
## Title: Azure SQL and Automation, how to keep your database up-to-speed in the cloud
## Abstract:
### While the typical DBA role is being assigned to mission-critical databases, we developers, still need to plan for some basic database maintenance. 
During this session, we will review the typical maintenance activities that need to be taken in Azure SQL and how to make sure they execute on a regular basis, without a higher cost and with low supervision effort. Several demos will also be reviewed to show the usage and potential of these techniques.

Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: Not just polish – How good code also runs faster
## Abstract:
### I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.

# First steps with SQL Server on Docker
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Bartosz Ratajczyk
## Title: First steps with SQL Server on Docker
## Abstract:
### Containers are gathering more and more attention. Wherever you take a look at - you have them. SQL Server 2019 introduces Big Data Clusters that utilise Kubernetes to orchestrate SQL Server, Spark and HDFS containers. Starting with SQL Server Express 2014 each next version of SQL Server is available as a Docker container. If your contact with containers technology was somehow limited - it's time to change that.
 
Join me in the session where I will introduce you to the Docker containers world. You will see their phenomena and will take a look at how you can start using them in your work. During the hour we will start from the beginnings, through use cases, to configuring custom SQL Server environment within minutes and starting it in seconds. We will focus on SQL Server, but also take a look at the other applications.

## Speaker: Adam Marshall
## Title: Tools and techniques for managing big data with Power BI.
## Abstract:
### I've had the pleasure of working on an IoT project recently, which has meant having to make critical decisions related to managing the large data size with Power BI. Power BI has come with various offerings to tackle this challenge, including composite models, aggregations and incremental refresh. I would like to share my experience of working with these new features.

# Use Docker to Deploy SQL Server Applications
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Frank Geisler
## Title: Use Docker to Deploy SQL Server Applications
## Abstract:
### Docker can not only be used for testing purposes, but also for deploying applications. The big advantage for the customer of the application is that nothing has to be installed, there are no obstacles to the application running in the given environment etc. because the environment is defined by the developer. German Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler will show how all of this can be achieved by using docker. There will be plenty of demos in which all the necessary steps will be shown.

# End-to-end monitoring for a successful Power BI implementation
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Marc Lelijveld
## Title: End-to-end monitoring for a successful Power BI implementation
## Abstract:
### Implementing Power BI in your organisation is more then allowing people to download Power BI desktop and publish reports to the Power BI Service. People have to be aware of what Power BI is able to achieve for them! But how do you know who is creating what? Using what? Or maybe even more important, sharing (confidential) information with others? 

With a Power BI end-to-end monitor you will be able to monitor all Power BI content allover your tenant. These actionable insights will help you to see who needs some extra help, but also in governing your data solutions within your organisation. 

In this session I will show you which insights you will get with an end-to-end monitor and how you can monitor your own Power BI environment.

## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: BI in Azure one year live
## Abstract:
### After more than one year live with BI in Azure Alexander Klein would like to give an honest feedback. 

Which architecture is the right one? Which tools/services should I use ( Azure Data Factory V1 or V2, Azure Stream Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Analysis Service, Azure Data Lake, Power BI, ...) ?
What was good and what wasn't so good? What do you have to pay attention to? What can you possibly do better in the next project?

Alexander Klein will answer all these questions and more in this presentation.

## Speaker: Mikael Wedham
## Title: A Masters view on Locking and blocking
## Abstract:
### How do the wait stats show you that you have a locking issue?
This session will show you how to detect and view blocking and lock waits, and understand the cause of it.
An extensive walkthrough of the different isolation levels and their respective benefits and drawbacks.
And finally a real-world quick list of suggestions on what you can do to solve some of the common issues I come across in my daily work.

# "Can I join you?", one table asked the other
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Thomas Hütter
## Title: "Can I join you?", one table asked the other
## Abstract:
### So you have your database beautifully set up according to Codd. What do you need when you have to retrieve data from related tables? Most probably a JOIN operator, but which one?

Fom LEFT to RIGHT, when is it INNER and when OUTER? Is a CROSS JOIN something NATURAL? And why may ANTI yield more results than SEMI...? How and when do their buddies MERGE, HASH and NESTED LOOP get to participate? 

We'll have demos for all of this on well-known databases. And if all that doesn't make your head dizzy enough, I might even throw in some CROSS and OUTER APPLY.

## Speaker: Gabi Münster
## Title: Continuous Intelligence... What's this all about?
## Abstract:
### Continuous Intelligence combines the terms of Continuous Integration and Business Intelligence and aims for defining and implementing processes to keep your implementation and deployment processes for your BI applications flexible and as seamless as possible.
Even in the near past support for CI processes of BI projects was almost not there. But the last few years brought some changes to the perception of this topic and shifted the mindset.
Let's look at advantages and challenges for CI in BI and at possibilities to implement such a process for Analysis Services.

## Speaker: Jonathan Stewart
## Title: Now you see it, but did you really?  Correcting visual fallacies...
## Abstract:
### Humans see images 60,000x better than text but are we always seeing what is being shown?  In this talk, we will look at ways a visual designer can intentionally or unintentionally confuse readers by using techniques that are common but not correct.  We will discuss topics such as color theory, chart selection and placement among others.  Come join us to learn what makes a visualization clear and learn how to convey your story.

# Don't Bite Off More Than You Chew - Take It in Chunks
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Don't Bite Off More Than You Chew - Take It in Chunks
## Abstract:
### Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions.

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors - something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.

# ABC's of the Power BI REST API
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Jens Vestergaard
## Title: ABC's of the Power BI REST API
## Abstract:
### In this session we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. While the Power BI REST API is extensive, we will be limiting this session on the following sections of interest: Dashboards, Datasets, Reports  Groups.
	• How many Dashboards are there in a workspace?
	• Which Datasource is this Dataset configured to use?
	• Who is allowed to see this Report?
	• Can I take ownership of this Dataset?
	• How do I resfresh my Dataset?
	• Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?
	• ...
Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.
Attending this session will make you familiar with the Power BI REST API and provide you with guidance on how to manage the most common tasks in Power BI.

# Applying Agile in Business Intelligence
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Jeroen Bosems
## Title: Applying Agile in Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, we will be discussing the merits of Agile processes in Business Intelligence (BI) development. 
First of all the focus will be on explaining the differences between Agile methodology and Waterfall processes in BI and why Agile is here to stay. 
Agile requires a specific mindset in BI projects due to being full stack and we give pointers on what rules can make your communication with the business more fluent. 
This will include the value of maintaining live documentation for both business and developer.
We then look at technical limitations for implementing Agile that are specific to BI and how to overcome these. 
Following this, we can describe how we're pragmatically going to apply these principles, and elaborate on splitting up the scopes in a project (staging, Data Warehouse, and reporting layers). 
By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of Agile development in BI, and some tools of how to apply this to your day to day operations.

## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: ETL with Azure Databricks, The Complete Introduction
## Abstract:
### Azure Databricks seems to be the new sheriff in town. It promises easy but capable ETL (amongst other things). But how does it work? For an SSIS (and possibly BIML) person this all looks new and strange. Python notebooks? Scala? Spark? What is all this, and where do I start? Well, you start by coming to this presentation. We’ll take a look at how to approach making an Azure Databricks based ETL solution from start to finish. Along the way it will become clear how Azure Databricks works and we will use our SSIS based ETL knowledge to see if it can handle the common use-cases from our daily jobs. And of course we will also have some fun and see how fast it can go!

## Speaker: Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 brought us Graph Database and the MATCH clause and SQL Server 2019 comes with further improvements.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

## Title: The Microsoft Power Platform - What is it?
## Abstract:
### May I introduce you to the Microsoft Power Platform!? 
This new term was introduced by Satya Nadella and James Philips as the serving foundation for building powerful (cloud-baked) applications. PowerApps as the data manipulation part, Microsoft Flow as the connecting workflow engine and Power BI for analysis and reporting. In addition, the Common Data Service (CDS) and the Common Data Model (CDM) provide a solid framework for data storage and modelling.
Join me in this session if you want to get an overview about the involved technologies, how they work together, see them live  working together in many demos and how they will definitely change the way of building powerful solutions in the future!

## Speaker: Marek Jablonski
## Title: SQL Server database perfomance on Azure, Google and AWS cloud platform
## Abstract:
### The popular image of cloud services is both attractive and enticing. Your systems can run seamlessly at peak performance anywhere in the world, and It is natural to assume that the performance of cloud services is identical and stable, regardless of whether it’s located.
To confirm if this is really the case, a series of performance tests were conducted on Microsoft SQL Server in three different locations and on three different cloud platforms: Azure, AWS and Google. We also compeer the results, from three Azure Service tiers (Basic 5 DTU, Standard S3 100 DTU and Premium P2 250 DTU) with previous tests from December 2016 and March 2018.

We will present the test methods and the results and findings.
Based on our measurements we have seen:

-	Significant variations in performance between the different geographical locations
-	Significant variations in performance for the same database at different times
-	Surprisingly poor performance of Azure Basic and Standard tiers

## Title: SQL Injection: What Is It, Prevent It, Monitor For It!
## Abstract:
### This session will explain and demonstrate exactly how a SQL Injection attack occurs. While the core vulnerability is easy to understand, exactly how hackers exploit that vulnerability is not. I'll show you how a hacker explores your database through SQL Injection to find vulnerabilities and sensitive data. Better still, I'll show you the errors that this exploration generates, providing a mechanism for monitoring your systems to identify SQL Injection attacks. Finally, I'll show you the steps you should be taking to properly secure your systems in order to completely avoid SQL Injection attacks. SQL Injection is considered the primary vulnerability for most systems today. Learn how to protect yourself and your organization.

Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Making Managed Instance Perform, a dive into storage.
## Abstract:
### Moving to the cloud means that we need to take a different approach when it comes to how we design and tune databases. Managed Instance is a case in point, get the storage configuration wrong and it will not perform. Together we will look at the storage options and architecture for Managed Instance before demonstrating how to get tune the storage layer to get the performance we need. Of course none of this is any use without knowing what level of performance you need so we will look at how you can get this information before you start testing.

# Execution plans ... where do I start?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution plans ... where do I start?
## Abstract:
### SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That's where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it's slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

# Practical Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-854)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: Practical Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### An improvement of cardinality estimation is something we try to find in every next version of SQL Server. Even with all the improvements the SQL Server 2014 Query Processor gained, we still need to deal with Hash and Sort Warnings, extremely high or low Memory grants, or the well-known User Defined Functions performance issues. That’s why we are so existed to find the new wave of adaptive query processing improvements to handle the more intractable cardinality estimation issues that often result in a poor query performance. Join me in this demo rich session to find what’s in Adaptive QP for you and how it affects your queries and workload. You will find answers of questions like is there a reason to migrate my database to SQL Server 2017 or 2019, what it will bring for my workload.
