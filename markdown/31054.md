## Abstract:
### Itâ€™s no secret that social networking is here to stay.  Rather than shutting down all social networking at work organizations should put policies, procedures and training in place for responsible tweeting, blogging, etc.  These policies should include responsible ways to use the media rather than abuse it.  Included in this presentation will be ways to structure your policies.  These methods will help your organization use social networking to promote your brand and educate consumers about new products and services.
