## Speaker: Rock Pereira
## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### This talk shows how to use Kubernetes to analyze both high-volume data on HDFS, and high-value, very recent relational data in SQL Server. In the demo, we'll work with a time series dataset (1 billion rows) of 26,000 marine vessels in the Northwest from 2015 to 2017 to understand shipping patterns and improve safety. We'll do data prep with Spark, spatiotemporal analysis with R, and model serving with SQL Server.
