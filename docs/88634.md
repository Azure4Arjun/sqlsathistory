## Speaker: Greg Moore
## Title: Pocket-sized Server: SQL Server for under $200!
## Abstract:
### With a growing focus on large data solutions that span terabytes and use dozens of CPUs and vast amounts of memory, sometimes the smaller solutions are overlooked, especially when considering the Internet of Things where often you may want data collection close to the data you're collecting.
At the other end of the spectrum there's an amazing amount of power available in very small form-factors. This session will explore what can be done with cheap off the shelf "computers on a board" form factors and Linux to build cheap and easy to deploy small SQL solutions that can be useful for a variety of data collection activities.
