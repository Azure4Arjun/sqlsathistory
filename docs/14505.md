## Title: Cloudy with a Chance of Data
## Abstract:
### Cloud, Cloud, Cloud.  Microsoft is "all in". CxOs love the idea of renting compute resources.  You know this is where our profession is headed, but when and how fast.  When should you jump on board?  The good news is cloud will not eliminate or even reduce the need for IT and Data professionals.  The bad news is our world and our profession is changing.  Adapt or be left behind.  Come see what Microsoft Azure has to offer Data Professionals.
