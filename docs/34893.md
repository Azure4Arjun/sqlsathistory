## Title: Big Data Lambda Architecture Overview
## Abstract:
### When most people think of processing terabytes and even petabytes of information, they often think of batch processing.  After all, processing platforms like Hadoop or Cassandra are batch-oriented.  While adding processing nodes can reduce processing latency, it does not address desired "real-time" processing requirements.  How can you process big data sets in real-time while leveraging batch-oriented Big Data infrastructure?  By example, how do services like Twitter consider the vast quantities of tweets, past and present, to provide real-time trending analytics? The answer lies within the architectural patterns of what is called Big Data Lambda Architecture.  In this session we will establish the context of the Lambda Architecture and explore the architectural patterns and practices of implementing it to provide both a low and high latency Big Data processing capability to your business.
