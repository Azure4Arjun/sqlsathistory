## Title: Introduction to Microsoft StreamInsight
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2008 R2, Microsoft also released a powerful though relatively little known tool called StreamInsight.  Microsoft StreamInsight is a complex event processing (CEP) engine that allows you to process, filter and aggregate high volumes of data with relatively low latency.  This session will cover core concepts related to StreamInsight including events and windows along with examples of of how to incorporate StreamInsight into your environment.  Though bundled with SQL Server, a familiarity with .NET is required.
