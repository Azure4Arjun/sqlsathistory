## Title: Optimizing SSIS PackagesUsing Sql Server 2008
## Abstract:
### In this session, Ryan will be giving some tips on how to better optimize your 2008 SSIS packages. Specifically looking at the data flow task, the demonstration will take a look at how an existing package performs which contains common and not so common mistakes. Then starting with the source, we will take a look on how to improve the performance of the package by editing some of the properties of each component (such as the new and improved lookup in 2008) contained in the data flow.
