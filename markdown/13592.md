## Title: Closing the data loop with Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### Master Data is not only a source in your organisation, but very often requires data feedback from various other IT systems. In addition to a high level introduction to Master Data Services(MDS) in SQL 2012, we will focus on closing the loop between MDS and your Data Warehouse. This will be a technical talk on the back-end integration points of MDS and how we can exploit these with SSIS.
