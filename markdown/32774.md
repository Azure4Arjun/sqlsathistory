## Title: Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Let's go from Cradle to Grave with the one dimension in 99.99999% of cubes, the dreaded Date dimension.  Without this dimension users wouldn't know if it is worth staying open on a holiday or which day of the week the most fresh produce ships or even what their bonus will be.  What should be included in the dimension? Should you use the wizard to generate? In this session, we will explore a generic date dimension load script and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time  dimension.  We will explore performance considerations of attribute hierarchies compared with usability benefits of user hierarchies. Finally, we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make Order Date, Ship Date and Received Date dimensions.
