## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: We need to go deeper: Exploring CTEs
## Abstract:
### Join me for a twisting and turning session where we look at some interesting uses of common table expressions and recursive CTEs. We'll look at nested CTEs, managing duplicate rows, string and XML parsing as well as dependency trees and other hierarchies. These are not just cool tricks - they're powerful T-SQL patterns that can improve the stability and performance of your data cleansing and ETL code.
