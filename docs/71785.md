## Speaker: Jeff Reinhard
## Title: Agile Database Development and Zero Downtime Deployments
## Abstract:
### Does your database development process match your agile frontend counterparts?
Is SQLServer Data Tools the right tool for an agile deployment methodology?

Join me in a fresh approach that will build deployments designed to be agile from the beginning, and also support the capability for zero down time deployments by supporting multiple states of the application, so database deployments can be made in advance, without breaking the application or requiring an outage.

Going zero will make you a hero!
