## Title: Scripting in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will explore the two scripting tools in SQL Server Integration Services, the Script Task and Script Component.  We'll take a tour through each of these tools, learning how they can add flexibility to your SSIS packages.  We'll discuss not only how but when and why to write code in SSIS, and will have a number of demos to illustrate.
