## Speaker: Oliver Engels
## Title: M versus P versus R -  Languages for Data Exploration
## Abstract:
### Power Query the new Excel Add In is a great data exploration toolset combined with other add ons
like Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map This session will take a deep dive into the language behind
the Power Query: "M". We will take the language concepts and possibilities and try to compare them
with another cool kids in town: "R" and "P" aka Python.  What possibilities
do these languages offer, where can you use them best and how good is the integration to the Microsoft stack.
The session is driven by demos and you will take away a good starting point how to work with these three
languages.
