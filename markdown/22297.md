## Title: Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The best defense is a good offence. Learn how to practice hacking without going to jail or getting fired. In this presentation we'll be going over how to exploit weak SQL servers with actual tools of the penetration testing trade. You will learn why the SQL Service is a popular target on your network and how to defend against basic attacks.  We will also attempt to snag some credentials from the SAM cache so we can go galavanting across the rest of the network.
