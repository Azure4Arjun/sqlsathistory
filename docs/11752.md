## Speaker: Meredith Ryan-Smith
## Title: Women In Technology Roundtable
## Abstract:
### It has been shown many times that diverse teams create better products and develop more creative solutions to issues.  Given that why does Technology still have problems with diversity?  It seems for every article that you see highlighting a group doing good work that encourages women to consider STEM career choices, there is another that points out the issues women face inside STEM. Join a group of prominent women from data professions as we discuss the current state of WIT, and what can be done to create a more welcoming space for all.
