## Title: Boosting SSAS productivity with Tabular Editor
## Abstract:
### Authoring SSAS tabular models using the standard tools (SSDT) can be a pain when working with large models. This is because SSDT keeps a connection open to a live workspace database, which needs to be synchronized with changes in the UI. This makes the developer experience slow and buggy at times. Tabular Editor is an open-source alternative, that relies only on the Model.bim metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM). Compared to SSDT, making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" experience, making it much easier to manage and author large models. Combined with scripting functionality, a Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more, Tabular Editor is a must for every SSAS Tabular developer. This PowerPoint-free session will focus on demoing the capabilities of the tool.
