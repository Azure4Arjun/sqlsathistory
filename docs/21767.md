## Title: Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services with DMVs
## Abstract:
### Imagine having the power in your hands to quickly provide activity information about open connections to Analysis Services, memory usage by specific objects, or a list of cube measures in a connection. In this session, you'll discover the power of SQL Server Analysis Services Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that provide this information and so much more. These simple yet powerful views provide administrators with easy access to valuable information including current active sessions and connections, memory consumption, performance counters, and cube partitioning. In addition, DMVs also provide the ability to richly describe and document the structure of your cubes.
