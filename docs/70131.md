## Title: PaaS Your BISM: Intro to Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### The acronyms get out of control sometimes but the platform as a service (PaaS) offerings keep coming!  Microsoft has introduced another one in the data platform called Azure Analysis Services.  This service allows for the hosting of your BI Semantic models (BISM) in Azure.  In this session we'll get an introduction to this new service and walk through how to get started using it.  We'll also discuss the benefits and differences of this and the on premise SSAS solution.
