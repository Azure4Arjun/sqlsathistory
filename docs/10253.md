## Title: SQL LogShipping with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### SQL Server LogShipping is an option to keep a copy of a database on another site.  It is also a way to have a read-only copy of a database on another server for reporting, etc.  This session will cover going outside the box and using PowerShell to backup, ship, and restore the database backups to another server.  This has been used to LogShip over the internet and over an FTP infrastructure.  This session is intended to show the possibilities of PowerShell and SQL Server together.  There will be full end-to-end demos of the pieces that make this possible.
