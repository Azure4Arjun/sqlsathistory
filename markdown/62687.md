## Title: How Indexes and Statistics can improve performance of our databases
## Abstract:
### This session covers the internals of statistics and indexes in Microsoft® SQL Server®. Creating and maintaining statistics and indexes is a core element in enhancing the performance of the SQL Server Database Engine. Both statistics and indexes are used to select suitable query execution plans; indexes also speed up the retrieval of data. To understand and influence query performance, you should have a good understanding of queries and indexes.
