## Title: Shape It: Shaping and Modelling Data With Power BI Desktop
## Abstract:
### In this demo-rich session, we will delve into using various data sources (SQL Server, Excel, Folder, Enter Data, and more) to Get Data into Power BI Desktop. We will shape and clean that data using the fantastic transformation options available in the Query interface (based on Power Query). We will show how to use M (Power Query Formula Language) to create useful, reusable functions and perform meaningful transformations not supported by the graphical interface. We will discuss the basics of Dimensional Modelling and apply those practices to our Power BI Desktop model. By the end of the session, we will have created a meaningful, useful data model from multiple data sources using the outstanding functionality provided by Power BI Desktop.
