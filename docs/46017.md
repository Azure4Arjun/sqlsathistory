## Title: Planning and Executing a Successful SQL Server Database Migration
## Abstract:
### Migrating an existing database to SQL Server requires much more than just moving the schema and data.  They key to a successful database migration effort includes designing the target system, identifying all components from the existing system that will need to be migrated, and allowing adequate time for changes and testing. 

In this session we will discuss all the different database components and configuration items that will need to be considered during the migration effort, how to utilize the SQL Server Migration Assistant as a planning and implementation tool, what components cannot be migrated (and what can be done about it),  and pitfalls to avoid during the development, testing, and final implementation.
