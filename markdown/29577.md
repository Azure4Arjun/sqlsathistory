## Title: Storing Data in the Cloud: Beyond SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### We live in world where the management of structured data is dominated by relational databases. What happens when we get to the cloud? You may have heard about SQL Azure, Microsoft's take on SQL Server for the cloud. Won't everything be just like the old days? Not so fast... In this talk we will review some of the key differences between SQL Server and SQL Azure, then consider some of the other data storage options offered by Windows Azure. After this talk you will understand the broader picture of storage in Windows Azure and have a basic understanding of how to employ these complementary data storage solutions -- along-side some of the old-school approaches you currently know and love.
