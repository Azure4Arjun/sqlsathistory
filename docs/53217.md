## Title: Query Store: Taking control of your query performance [EN]
## Abstract:
### Many of us came across a situation when a query suddenly becomes slow. To understand the reason for the slowdown, it would be nice to see what was the query plan before that. Was it the same or another, if it was another, then what had changed? It was a hard to figure it out unless you had implemented your own monitoring system. Fortunately, in SQL Server 2016 we have the solution out of the box, it's called – Query Store.
Query Store is a kind of “flight recorder” for your database, it provides functionality to capture queries, plans and execution statistics in the database, more to the point it allows you to force a particular plan for a query. The session will describe Query Store functionality and capabilities, provide some Query Store internal implementation details and give several usage scenarios.
