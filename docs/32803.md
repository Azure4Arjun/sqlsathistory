## Title: Licensing SQL Server in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### Presentation on licensing, huh.  Boring? Maybe. Important? Absolutely!  Being a DBA isn't just all fun and games.  There are also some serious things to take care of. Licensing SQL Server is one of those and doing it right can mean the difference between a few thousand dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars.  This session will discuss how to license SQL Server specifically for the transition from a physical to a virtual environment. You'll find that maybe, more than anything else, it will be the way SQL Server is licensed that determines how you configure your entire virtual infrastructure.
