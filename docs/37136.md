## Title: The Usual SUSPECTs: When Good Databases Go Bad
## Abstract:
### You just finished patching your SQL Server. After rebooting it, though, some of your databases aren't coming online. What do you do? In this session we'll cover some of the various states that a database can be in. We’ll look at useful states like OFFLINE and STANDBY, as well as damaged states like SUSPECT or RECOVERY_PENDING. You’ll learn how databases get into those states, and the proper techniques to bring your data safely back online.
