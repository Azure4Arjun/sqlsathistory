## Title: Self Service BI – ETL and More From A Business Unit User’s Perspective
## Abstract:
### A business user is responsible for implementing a new electric power system modeling application and has to gather data from hundreds of diverse sources to set up the model.  Reference data sources included a multitude of different data types, including historical time series, commodity forward pricing curves, and power plant operating characteristics.  The user discovers the “power’ in Power Query and is able to meet the implementation deadline due to the Power Query’s rich tool set.  The business user continues to find Power Query to be a useful tool in daily tasks as a Power System Resource Planning Specialist.  Witness practical examples of Power Query’s Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) functionality applied to getting and reshaping data to perform the analyst’s daily tasks.
