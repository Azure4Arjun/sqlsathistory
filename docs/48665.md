## Speaker: Josh Sivey
## Title: Don’t forget the licensing!
## Abstract:
### It may not be the most exciting topic, but it can quickly become the most important topic for a project! Many developers and architects make technical decisions based on features and capabilities, but do not consider licensing as part of the decision making process. Other times decisions are made by perceived licensing costs, that may not truly impact a customer’s environment. In this session Matt Smith will provide an overview of licensing options and details to consider for SQL Server including editions, versions, agreements, and software assurance. After an initial level set, Matt will then focus on guidance and best practices for licensing a SQL Server environment across a number of scenarios such as: Virtualized environments, public and private cloud scenarios, support, upgrades, high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.
