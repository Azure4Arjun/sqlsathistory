# Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#58---Minnesota-2010)
Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers
## Abstract:
### An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.

# Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#58---Minnesota-2010)
Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA-1
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
## Abstract:
### Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting - a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems - and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

# Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#58---Minnesota-2010)
Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA-2
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder
## Abstract:
### Often, as DBAs, we are presented with the prospect of resolving performance issues. Consider when Bob the Developer shows up accusing the server of inadequacies and expecting resolution. After hours digging through log files and traces and you are able to identify code that Bob deployed that was the root of the problem. What if there was a way to do this type of performance tuning before Bob the Developer shows up and before Sue the User figures out there are performance issues? In this session we’ll take a look at Extended Events and how you can leverage it in every day scenarios. We’ll discuss the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to understand the information.

# Using XML to Query Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#58---Minnesota-2010)
Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA-2
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Using XML to Query Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views. The execution plans are a gold mine of information. From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek. Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your fingertips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases. In this session we’ll look at how you can begin to understand and query the structure of the execution plans in the procedure cache. Also, we’ll review how to uncover some potential performance issues that may be lurking in your SQL Server.

Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA-1
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This fast paced session will take you through many aspects of the internal operations of SQL Server and, for those topics we don’t cover, will point you to resources where you can get more information.  So strap on your silly, as we cover all these topics and more at speed with tongue planted firmly in cheek!

# Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#58---Minnesota-2010)
Event Date: 29-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA-1
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy.  And it doesn’t mean that database administration on SQL Server is problem free.  And since SQL Server is constantly growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again.  In fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?
