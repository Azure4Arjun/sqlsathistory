## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys â€“ De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign key constraints are the ultimate Catch-22.  They are necessary to ensure the relationship integrity between a parent table and its child tables.  However, they may also have a significant downside effect on insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Key constraints and how they maintain data integrity when properly maintained.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling them.  You will also learn the possible side effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demonstrated with many script examples.  Attendees should have some knowledge of Management Studio and the SELECT statement.
