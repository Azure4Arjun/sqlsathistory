## Title: Solving Real Business Problems Step by Step
## Abstract:
### When you’re first starting out, queries can be daunting. The experts on your team seem to do it instinctively. But the flexibility of T-SQL makes it seem near impossible to translate a business problem into an executed query.

Luckily, we’ve developed a set of rough guidelines to do just that. In this session, we deconstruct the ad-hoc query in the context of real business problems. We will explore and test our step-by-step approach using the AdventureWorks database as our sandbox, as if you are an employee for Adventure Works and you’ve just been handed a problem to solve.
