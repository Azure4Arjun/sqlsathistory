## Title: An Introductory Look at Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at some introductory execution plans, both estimated and actual, to help determine what the query optimizer will do, or has done, with the query presented. It should be noted that this session is not intended to be an in depth look at performance tuning, but rather a cornerstone in learning to use a tool appropriate for tuning.
