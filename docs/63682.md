## Title: Artificial Intelligence:Canned  Ready to Consume in MS Cognitive Services
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Cognitive Services are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable. Microsoft Cognitive Services expands on Microsoft’s evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily add intelligent features – such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding – into their applications. Joe will be demonstrating a wide variety of the APIs in multiple clients including PowerApps, Flow and Power BI. He will also be discussing what he learned at Build about new and expanded Cognitive APIs launched there.
