## Title: A Tour of R in the Microsoft Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### Over the past few years R has been popping up in several areas within the Microsoft ecosystem. It was first introduced in Azure ML then later appeared in Power BI and SQL Server. Unfortunately, the benefits of the R programming language are not understood by many Microsoft professionals so these tools are not being fully utilized. I hope to change that for some with this talk.

In this session we will take a tour of R in the Microsoft ecosystem. We will show the different ways R can be leverage and present compelling reasons why it is a very valuable tool that you should add to your data analytics arsenal. No R experience is needed for this session.
