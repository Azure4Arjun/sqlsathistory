## Title: Divide  Conquer Reporting - With Replication
## Abstract:
### In this session I will go over how to separate your systems for transactional databases, and for reporting.  I will cover the basics of replication, the types, which one is right for your situation, agents it creates and their purpose, provide tips, best practices, and dispel any fears you may have heard or validate them about replication.
