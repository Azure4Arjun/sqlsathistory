## Title: Because the world is not just relational - Intro to RavenDB
## Abstract:
### RavenDb is a .NET document database with an HTTP REST API, Lucene based indexes, ACID read/writes and BASE queries that's been picking up steam in the .NET space.
In this session we'll see the very basics of using RavenDB from a web application, including reads, writes and simple queries. We'll see how RavenDB uses LINQ and Lucene to create indexes similar to materialized views to provide fast query-time responses,  and what are the main differences in modeling data and entities from the perspective of a developer used to relational databases.
