## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Modern Concerns about Reporting Style with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers.  Reports combine tables with charts and KPIs and more.  Visually, there is a lot to be concerned with when designing your report to get the right information across to your audience.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation.  Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty.  It is about grabbing your audience's attention.  It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce ADA (American Disabilities Act) problems that will detract from your message if your audience cannot understand or interpret your data.  This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of ADA concerns to keep your data's message on track.
