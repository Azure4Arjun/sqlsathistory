## Title: Storage, Backup and Restore Management in the Cloud World
## Abstract:
### The world has changed. The work is changing. Some feature from our dreams come true. In The World of Cloud we can store our data in the cloud. We can create Backup and very easy (?) Restore to and from any point of The World of The Cloud. But... how to manage that? Which tools, applications, ideas, solutions we can use for this? In this workshop we will test our cloud environment, and solutions. We will focus on Windows Azure SQL Database, SQL Server on Premise, BLOB Storage and many of free tools which we can use for our comfortable work. We will talk about best and worse practices and of course we will test those procedures.
