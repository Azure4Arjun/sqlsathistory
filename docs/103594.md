## Speaker: Phillip Seamark
## Title: Troubleshooting DAX
## Abstract:
### I will share my leaning from being 1yr on the Power BI CAT team, showing how we debug DAX for large customers. Get a walk through of practical techniques used by the Microsoft Power BI team when debugging and optimizing DAX in large models. These apply equally for small and medium-size models. Youâ€™ll leave this session knowing how to identify and speed up slow running DAX calculations.
