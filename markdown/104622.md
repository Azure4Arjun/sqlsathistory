## Title: Architecting Microsoft Azure Data Platform Solutions Correctly
## Abstract:
### Migrating SQL Server databases into Microsoft's Azure platform has proven to be problematic for a number of organizations. Solution architect's do not necessarily understand all the different PaaS and IaaS offerings, or their implications to operationalization and cost/licensing. As a result a lot of organization implement sub-optimal/incorrect solutions or experience "sticker shock" at the end of their first year in the cloud. Migrating your SQL Server databases into the cloud is easy! Migrating your SQL Server databases into the cloud correctly is potentially not so easy. In this pre-con we examine how to correctly architect your transition into the cloud from an architectural perspective, yet also focus on performance, security, operationalization and cost (of course). The pre-con will focus on the following SQL Database, SQL Elastic Pools, SQL Managed Instance, SQL Hyperscale, SQL DW. We will also touch upon Cosmos DB, Data Lake, Data Factory, Analysis Services and Power BI. Wow!
