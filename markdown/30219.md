## Speaker: Geoff Johnson
## Title: Intro to Common Table Expressions
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTEs) serve two main functions: first they remove the clutter of subqueries out of the FROM clause while simultaneously making them easy to reference multiple times by alias if need be, and second they make it possible to do recursive queries. Learn the basics of using CTEs to streamline T-SQL code and to query self-referential tables.
