## Title: Writing queries in SQL Server 2016-2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server releases follow each other seamlessly. If you are a database developer, is a tough task to stay up to date with new features and getting to know all the improvements that are available. 
Have new functions been released? Does the optimizer behave in a different way than the past? What happens to the execution plan? Do I need to know any query hint in order to optimize my queries?
The final question is: how does it affect my way of writing T-SQL queries? How can I benefit from this continuous flow of updates? 
So, this session was designed for you. We will go through the new features introduced in SQL Server 2016/2017 for writing T-SQL queries. Some of the topics covered are: functions, execute external scripts, JSON support, automatic tuning, querying temporal tables, ...
For each of them we compare the same scripts before and after the new additions, to highlight the differences in terms of code writing, simplification, reusability, performance improvements.
