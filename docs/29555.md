## Title: Data Orchestration with System Center + SQL
## Abstract:
### This session will explore various options for data and process management leveraging System Center Orchestrator, System Center Service Manager, PowerShell, SQL 2008 R2, SSRS, as well as other Microsoft offerings. One of the demonstrations will highlight an existing production infrastructure where managed data is remotely collected from various sources (Hyper-V, Windows Host OS, Storage, Network, and Security, even Guest Virtual Machine SQL databases), stored in SQL 2008 R2, reported via SSRS, and presented via an intranet SharePoint portal.
