## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Creating Custom Components for SSIS
## Abstract:
### SSIS data flows are great tools for moving data. But what if you need to go beyond the out-of-the-box components provided with SSIS? Custom components are a great way to encapsulate and reuse functionality for the data flow in SSIS. We will discuss what it takes to create and deploy custom components in SSIS, review the pros and cons of using custom components instead of scripts, and discuss some of the common challenges and issues with creating them.

# Processing Flat Files with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#48---Columbia-2010)
Event Date: 02-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DB Dev 2
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
## Abstract:
### When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats.

# Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#48---Columbia-2010)
Event Date: 02-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Misc
## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS
## Abstract:
### The complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poorly planned and executed ETL project will inevitably lead to maintenance nightmares, low reliability of the system, or worse yet, to the failure of the project. 
In this session, we will use ETL best practices to make a requirements checklist you can use in your next ETL implementation, and will demonstrate  how you can use SSIS to implement and meet  such requirements. If  you already learned the basics about SSIS and now want to take your ETL solutions to the next level, or if you became an SSIS developer/architect by accident and wonder what do you need to succeed, then this is the right session for you.

# Managing Database Schemas With VS201 DB projects
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#48---Columbia-2010)
Event Date: 02-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DB Dev 2
## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Managing Database Schemas With VS201 DB projects
## Abstract:
### Most developers agree that the database is the most important component in a typical application, yet the processes for managing changes to database objects as part of the development cycle are often rudimentary or inexistent.
In this session Rafael explains how you can use Visual Studio database projects to have better control over your database development cycle and  reduce the risk and complexity involved in managing  schema changes, testing and deployment.  He will talk about the pros and cons he has experienced when using VS DB projects in his last projects, and will highlight some of the  improvements available in the latest version of the tool. 
This session showcases VS 2010, but most the content remains relevant for VSDB2008 GDR2

## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: Data Files and Transaction Logs -- beyond the GUIs
## Abstract:
### Performance of SQL Server poor? One cause may have been that starting file size that you didn't think was important because it will auto-grow. Why is auto-grow bad? Why shouldn't logs be auto-shrunk? Explore the physical structure of a database, how table structure effects use of memory and key mistakes to avoid. Additionally, dive into the transaction log process - VLFs, auto-recovery and lock escalation. Solid foundation for Programmers and Administrators!

# OLTP (yes!) Databases and Cube Design
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#48---Columbia-2010)
Event Date: 02-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI 2
## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: OLTP (yes!) Databases and Cube Design
## Abstract:
### OLAP, Cube, BI, SSAS -- what is the difference? In this session look at the difference between a database designed for OLAP and OLTP -- star and snowflake schemas and the benefits and costs of each. After we understand what is sourcing a cube we will look at the basic cube structure, how to source from OLTP or OLAP database and the cost of ROLAP, HOLAP and MOLAP. I have implemented many cubes for small finance departments allowing them to browse a nightly set of data in Excel, without them downloading spreadsheets of data during production hours. The cube improved overall system performance without a redesigned database.

## Speaker: Wayne Snyder
## Title: Information Visualization - Making great Charts
## Abstract:
### This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards and charts should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. I will prove that you are blind! You will be surprised.  Join me - this session is going to be hoot!

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

# Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#48---Columbia-2010)
Event Date: 02-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Misc
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.
