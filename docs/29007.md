## Title: An Introduction to ASP.NET MVC
## Abstract:
### ASP.NET MVC is Microsoft's implementation of an old design pattern, which fits web development better than ASP.NET does. It simplifies multiple aspects of web development that were complex in ASP.NET. It also gives ASP.NET developers a better and more accurate abstraction layer over the web. For example it doesn't use the problematic ViewState object. It removes most of the overly complex page lifecycle and it simplifies the ability to unit test web requests.

In this presentation we'll explain the MVC terminology and then we'll explore how to work with Controllers, Actions, Views and the Model. Then we'll walk though a real but simple ASP.NET MVC site so you can leave this session with enough knowledge to start a new ASP.NET MVC project.
