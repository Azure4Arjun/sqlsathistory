# It’s Time for a Change : Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: It’s Time for a Change : Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

# How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Ryan McCauley
## Title: How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.

# Introducing Forensic Analytics with Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ Power BI to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

# Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
## Abstract:
### Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Possible Musics: Choosing between SSAS Multidimensional and Tabular
## Abstract:
### The Analysis Services 2012 (and above) Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

# Table Partitioning -Beyond the Basics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Arnie Rowland
## Title: Table Partitioning -Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### You've read about table partitioning; you know that partitioning ‘promises’ to solve some performance issues, make backups -and even restores, faster, and, wait, wait, there’s more! Perhaps you have worked through demo code and set up a POC scenario. It looks good, like maybe it would solve some of the problems your organization faces.

But …

You’re just not sure how to pull it off. Sure, the demo code made it seem easy -and it will always be realtively simple for new tables, new data. You have a handle on the ‘basics’. However, your production database has very large tables, hundreds of millions, or even billions, of rows. The SLA does not allow much, if any, downtime.

This session will look at how Table Partitioning can be introduced into existing production environments with little or no downtime And we will explore the ‘real’ performance and maintenance benefits that can be harvested. So, if you want to move beyond the ‘Basics’, don’t miss this session.

# Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: Weird stuff I saw while supporting a Java team
## Abstract:
### After spending the last decade or so completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I spent the last year supporting the SQL Server instance for a team of Java developers. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. I did find, however, that there were cultural differences which made my biggest challenges different from what I was used to dealing with in the .Net world. Come hear about my misadventures with JBoss, server side cursors, and NOCOUNT settings.

# Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#492---Phoenix-2016)
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### "SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. For example, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed.
 
This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use both some undocumented and more commonly known commands to derive some interesting information from the database engine.
