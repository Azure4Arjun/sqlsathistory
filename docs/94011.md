## Title: Getting Data out of Active Directory with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### For many organizations Active Directory is the heart of the Network.  In this session we'll cover how to query users from AD groups, query groups within a specific OU, and dynamically get users for all groups in a specific OU.  We'll also discuss some of the limitations of ADSI and how to work around it.  Finally, we'll use a little SQL and a dash of Powershell and push updates back into Active Directory.
