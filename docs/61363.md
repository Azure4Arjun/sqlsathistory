## Title: JSON and the Astronauts
## Abstract:
### In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.

Goals:
Learn about JSON, and its basic data types
Discover how SQL Server 2016 can handle JSON data
Be amazed at the cool people NASA sends into space!
