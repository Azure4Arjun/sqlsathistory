Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: €20M+ fines and prison: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
## Abstract:
### Do you hold data on EU citizens? If so GDPR applies to you.

From the 25th May 2018 organisations who fail to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure and demonstrate that they are compliant will be liable for a fine of €20M or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is GREATER. Also, prison.

As a professional who works with data it is wise to ensure that you understand GDPR.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer.

Let me repeat: I AM NOT A LAWYER.

I am not qualified to give legal advice. However, I do know a thing or two about delivering software. In this talk I will bring your attention to the main aspects of GDPR and discuss some of the consequences this has on the use of production data and database lifecycle management (DLM).

I will focus on technical problems that we need to address. You can (and should) hire your own lawyers to provide legal advice.

# Data Modeling and Design for New Features in SQL Server and Cosmos DB
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DEV/DBA
## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: Data Modeling and Design for New Features in SQL Server and Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### With the availability of new Graph Database features in SQL Server 2017 and the new Cosmos DB, Microsoft’s globally-distributed, multi-model database service for managing data at scale, database architects are expected to create and translate data models to non-relational physical database designs.  For decades, data modeling and database design has been focused on the relational model, yet we have all these new features to model for.

In this session, we’ll look at:
Why these features still need data modelsHow to prepare data models, logical and physical, for these target featuresHow these features change the data model/database design processHow tools support these new features (or don’t)How to approach tuning for these non-relational featuresFinally, we end with 10 tips for working with non-relational features while still maintaining data model-driven database design.

# Power Query - The Best thing that ever happened in Excel
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Gašper Kamenšek
## Title: Power Query - The Best thing that ever happened in Excel
## Abstract:
### Excel so far had three "official" revolutions. One being the Pivot Table, second one Tables in Excel and the last one obviously Power Pivot. But Power Query (aka Get  Transform aka Data Explorer) trumps them all. This session will show you why this outrageous claim actually makes sense. This will be a full demo session that will prove the title right case by case and should also give you an understanding that if you do not use Power Query in Excel, you are not using Excel at all!

# Advanced insides into System Versioned Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Advanced insides into System Versioned Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduces support for system-versioned temporal tables as a database feature that brings built-in support for providing information about data stored in the table at any point in time rather than only the data that is correct at the current moment in time. 

This session takes you behind the basics of Temporal Tables and answers - after a short introduction - the following questions:
- How to handle the change of NULL constraints?
- Can Temporal Tables be renamed and what happens to the System Versioned table?
- What will happen if you change meta data (data length, data type, ...)?
- What happens if you drop a column or add another column to the Temporal Table?
- what about security for the  system versioned table?
- what about calculated columns in the temporal table?
- ...

You are interested in the answers to all the above questions (and more). This session will answer EVERY question about Temporal Tables.

## Title: Azure Data Factory vs SSIS, the Ins and Outs.
## Abstract:
### ADF provides a managed way to orchestrate the collection, movement and transformation of structured and semi-structured data together. It works both with on-premises and cloud data and it has - of course - a powershell interface, enabling you to manage it without the bling of the Azure portal. But is it useful, is it fast, is it easy and powerful to use ? And most of all is Azure Data Factory  the new SSIS ?
These are some of the questions that might arise, when reading about this new PaaS and that we will answer together in this demo packed session where will we go through orchestration, consumption and administration of data through the ADF pipeline.

# A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL
## Abstract:
### Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 comes now with a different approach: Graph Database. 
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

# Scale-Out your SSIS Package Executions
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI/DEV
## Speaker: Wolfgang Strasser
## Title: Scale-Out your SSIS Package Executions
## Abstract:
### With a rising number of parallel SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package executions the resource requirements on the SSIS server can be a limiting factor. In older SQL Server versions, scale-out architectures needed to be implemented by hand and required a lot of manual implementation effort. Beginning with SQL Server 2017, SSIS provides a built-in scale-out functionality for package executions. 
After the definition of scalability-types, the SSIS scale-out architecture and the involved system-parts are introduced. The attendees will learn the basics, get checklists and best practices when building up their own SSIS scale-out cluster. In addition to the configuration using SSMS other configuration options (command line, T-SQL,..) are presented. Behind the scenes information like logging, the programmability interfaces and configuration options will be shared.

# State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Algorithms in R from Microsoft
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#687---Slovenia-2017)
Event Date: 09-12-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Marcin Szeliga
## Title: State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Algorithms in R from Microsoft
## Abstract:
### Do you fancy learning regression and classification in one hour? 
We will start with linear regression, simple but powerful machine learning algorithm. With it you will learn about correlation coefficient, loss function, optimization algorithms and regularization. At the end of this section we will built a ML model using Fast linear model with Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) optimization.
Next step is get to know artificial neural networks, their architecture, activation functions and backpropagation algorithm. This allows us to build a (better?) model using rxNeuralNet and N#.
Evaluation metrics for regression models will conclude first part of the session.
In the second part we will use almost the same ML algorithms for classification — the difference is that Logistic regression will replace Linear regression. Finally we will learn about Evaluation metrics for classification models, which allows us to pick the very best model for problems we are going to solve together.

## Speaker: Kamil Nowinski
## Title: Understand better Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is an extraordinarily powerful engine of relational databases, which lets you achieve high scalability of data platform. For many years SQL Server gains more and more new features and more efficient mechanisms including InMemory or ColumnStore Indexes. However, there is still many companies not using those features and struggling with performance issues, which the root cause turn out the problems with concurrency. 
Let's back to the basis then in order to better understand transaction isolation levels available in SQL Server. On this session we will learn about a concurrency issue, (not)expected behaviours, lost modifications and consider how to cope with them. I will tell what the optimistic and pessimistic concurrency models are, when use it and what tempdb has in common with them. Also, we will see in practice how dangerous (NOLOCK) might be which has being used so passionately by developers.

### One of the biggest fears most customers have is upgrading to a new release of Microsoft SQL Server and having performance degrade, because of changes in query execution plans. SQL Server 2016 mitigated this risk by the introduction of the Query Store and the ability to easily force execution plans.

In this session, you will learn about the data that the query store captures to identify queries that have regressed. You will learn about patterns for upgrades that allow you to upgrade with minimal impact to user performance. You will see demos of how to identify when a query has regressed in either plan or performance, and you will get some hints for the future of the Query Store with Adaptive Plans in SQL Server 2017.

## Title: T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: How to kill performance in one, easy step
## Abstract:
### User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.

## Title: SQL Server and R for real-time predictions
## Abstract:
### Embedding your R (and soon Python!) models in SQL Server enables you to add predictive capabilities to your applications and your analytics without adding expensive components or going outside your network via expensive API calls.

In this demo-packed talk, you’ll see how you can go from a model built in R to making predictions on the fly in SQL Server 2016.
