## Title: Leveraging CDC and SSIS for ODS/DM/DW Loads
## Abstract:
### One of the challenges with loading ODS/DM/DW is gathering data and reducing performance impact.  Change Data Capture (CDC) is a means to capture all the changes of a given table, but how do you load this data to another Database.  We will walk through the process and considerations for loading data using SSIS package and how to detect changes to the CDC Configured Tables which has been known to cause SSIS Package failures.
