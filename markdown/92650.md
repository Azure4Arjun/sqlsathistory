## Title: Make Database Documentation your Minion
## Abstract:
### Most IT folks aren’t a fan of writing documentation. We are far more interested in creating solutions, solving problems, and making things go faster, than in documenting how we did it. 
But, Future Us will need to know what Today Us meant with this procedure’s parameters, and what that job is even for. Coworkers will thank us for explaining choices made for design, development, and admin. How can we do this without a big Word document?
T-SQL comments are simple and natural to create, and can reduce your future troubleshooting time by ten times or more!
In this session you’ll learn innovative options for documenting using comments, like using expanded flower boxes, headers, “extended commenting” (also known as help systems), and more. We’ll also talk about the options available for non-comment-able objects: tables, SSIS packages, and SSRS reports.
Documenting via comments serves YOU. They’re your repository of tribal knowledge, your exobrain, and your minion. Come learn all about it
