## Title: Power BI Advanced Modeling
## Abstract:
### After you have completed a few Power BI Dashboards and your customers love them, you get requests for multiple data sources, additional metrics, and maybe row level security. We will go through some more advanced modeling in Power BI to combine data sources, adjust the model as needed, and apply row level security to keep sensitive data compartmentalized.
