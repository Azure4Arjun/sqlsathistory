## Title: Turbo-Charged Transaction Logs
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often mis-understood components
of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long startup times, problems with the
transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log
works and how to optimize it's performance. You'll learn how to determine the right settings 
for maximum throughput, and what to do when things get out of control.
