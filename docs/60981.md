## Title: SSRS 2016, Tableau, Power BI: Using Data Visualization Tools to consume API data
## Abstract:
### With the possibility to visualize data with different tools it has become difficult to choose or determine  which one is better or when to use one over another. In this session, I'll be using three of the most popular tools to visualize data from outlook REST API. This session will also provide a high level understanding on how these tools can be used for this scenario and other possible cases, as well as their similarities and differences.
