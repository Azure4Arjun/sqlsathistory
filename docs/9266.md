## Title: Hybrid Solutions: The Future of SQL Server Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### The cloud is a polarizing buzzword in IT, especially for DBAs. The reality is that all of us will be affected by it over the next few years in one way or another much like we have been by virtualization. One of the best uses for the cloud is creating disaster recovery easier than we have been able to do in the past. This session will discuss the cloud from a SQL Server DBA perspective and how things like hybrid on premise/cloud solutions can be architected today to bring resiliency to current solutions with features like availability groups in SQL Server 2012 and 2014.
