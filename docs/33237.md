## Title: A better way to store and archive SQL Backups
## Abstract:
### How do you verify your daily backup can be restored? What if you need to restore a backup from several days ago instead of the latest? How many backups should you keep? I've adopted a Tower of Hanoi tape rotation schedule to meet our disk-to-disk backup needs, at first that sounds simple but it's actually MUCH more complex than it sounds - Learn about the strategy I use, the scripts we use to backup (with reports of success/failure and automatic retries for any failure), how we validate backups, and how we decide which backups to keep and which we erase to free up disk space.
