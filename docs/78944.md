## Title: On-premises, Hybrid and Cloud: Databases Can Live Anywhere Now!
## Abstract:
### Microsoft now has options to host your SQL Server database pretty much anywhere. However, with great choice comes great uncertainty.

This session will help shed light on what the options are available to you and what advantages and constraints each option has.

We'll look at:

On-Premises: Physical, Virtual, HA/DR and everything between
Hybrid: Mixed infrastructure (partial On-Premises, partial Cloud)
Cloud: The multiple Azure offerings for SQL Server

At the end of the session you will have an understanding of what options are available and what their unique offerings can mean to your business.
