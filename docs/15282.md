## Title: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and
## Abstract:
### When a developer goes it alone and works on their own feature of a product, there is always a chance that the feature will never be folded back into the main product, thus never released, effectively wasting that developerâ€™s time.  Continuous Integration means every time a developer writes code, that code is folded back into the main project and tested with all the other code. Continuous Integration means no developer is left behind.  Come to this session to learn how you can make sure all the code your developers have written is used, is effective, and works with all the other code being written. Come learn how to deploy software faster, with higher quality, and with fewer database problems!
