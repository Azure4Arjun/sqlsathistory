## Title: Introduction to Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a SQL-based fully managed, petabyte-scale cloud data warehouse. It is highly elastic, enabling you to provision in minutes and scale capacity in seconds. You can scale compute and storage independently, allowing you to burst compute for complex analytical workloads or scale down your warehouse for archival scenarios, and pay based off what you're using instead of being locked into predefined cluster configurations - helping you derive even more cost efficiency versus traditional data warehouse solutions.
