## Title: How mature has SSAS Tabular mode become?
## Abstract:
### SSAS Tabular mode is available sind version 2012. And for a lot of people, especially experienced SSAS Multidimensional users, the first versions left a lot to ask for. 
But Tabular experienced a lot of remarkable changes up to now. Let's look at a short summary of this interesting life story. And let's try to identify the most important steps of development. 
Another interesting view point is the comparison to SSAS Multidimensional mode. Which features are provided by both versions, where are the competitive advantages? 
This session will cover a more strategic point of view to both worlds with only short demos. And a common understanding of the important features of analytical solutions will be expected.
