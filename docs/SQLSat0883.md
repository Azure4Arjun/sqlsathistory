# SQL Graph Revealed
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#883-Louisville-2019)
Event Date: 03-08-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Mala Mahadevan
## Title: SQL Graph Revealed
## Abstract:
### ‘Graph data’ is normally used to describe data that is highly interconnected. Transportation routes, social media friends or connections, organizational charts, genealogical charts, product and customer data…the scenarios where you can find them are endless. The most common way graph data is modeled in the relational world is by using many-many-relationships..querying such structures can be very painful and expensive in terms of time and computing power. There are dedicated graph databases that do this..such as Neo4j..but what if most of your data is in a relational engine already? What if you want to keep the gains of a relational engine such as security, ACID properties and high availability and still do some graph modeling? SQL Server 2016+ supports graph data modeling as well. In this talk on SQL Graph Revealed we will learn about origins of graph theory, components of graph data, and advantages of modeling relationships using graph capabilities of SQL Server.

### You need to move data.  A lot of data.  To the cloud.  You’ve got data in a variety of on- and off-site data sources.  There are several ways to do it.  Some of them can be quite easily implemented using Azure Data Factory.  Learn how to use variables and looping in your Data Factory pipelines.  Use the Integration Runtime to pull directly from on-site sources.  See how to upload files to blob storage and import them.  Learn how to trigger Data Factory activities.  And, learn how to keep all those connection strings and passwords secret in Azure Vault.  After this session, you will have tools that you can readily implement in your own data migrations.

## Title: Using FileTables
## Abstract:
### The FileStream feature allows BLOBs to be managed by the DB.  FileTable expands on this feature by using specific tables for storing these BLOBs. This allows Windows apps to access these items as if there were stored on the file system but with benefits only a database can offer, such as text searching and querying.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

## Speaker: Tracy Boggiano
## Title: Using Open Source Products to Collect Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we’ll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize in an interactive way and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issue

# Applying Data Warehousing Principles

## Speaker: Spencer Swindell
## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
## Abstract:
### Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

## Title: 10 reasons you are paying too much (or too little) on your SQL licenses
## Abstract:
### If you are running SQL server in your production environment, then you know that licensing is not cheap. Not only is it expensive, but SQL licensing can be confusing, changes often, and can be hard to navigate even for the most seasoned professionals. This session will dive into 10 reasons your company may be overpaying (or underpaying) on your licenses and provide you with practical steps you can do to discover and fix those issues. As a bonus, I will also be sharing a free calculator script that I created that takes into account several things shared in this presentation (and more) that you can begin using immediately to help with your licensing decisions.  

This session is intended for anyone who is responsible for managing, allocating or advising on SQL licensing.
