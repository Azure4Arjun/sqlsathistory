## Title: Introduction To R
## Abstract:
### Data Science is a relatively new discipline. Core to this is the visualization of data. R is a language and environment used for data visualization and statistical computing.

In this session we'll explore the basics of the R language and review some examples. Additionally we'll review an implementation that integrates R into an ASP.NET application, allowing for sophisticated ways to display dashboards.
