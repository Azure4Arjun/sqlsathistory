## Title: Scripting tabular models
## Abstract:
### Introducing the new scripting language for tabular models. Before SQL Server 2016 tabular models was wrapped into a multidimensional constructs. TMSL is the new native language for tabular which is build on JSON - this makes it easy to understand, modify and deploy.

During this session I will go through and explain some examples on generating a SSAS tabular model by using the new TSML to demonstrate how powerfull this feature is and how you can use it to save time and effort.mduring this session I will spend some time explaining a real world example and how to make an implementation with MDS and business users.
