## Speaker: Sebastian Meine
## Title: SQL Server Cryptology - A Primer
## Abstract:
### So, you got told you need to encrypt "the database". Now what?
Join this session by security expert Sebastian Meine (Ph.D.) for an introduction to the fascinating world of cryptology. In this session, geared towards the DBA, you will learn the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, discover what a cryptographic one-way hash function is and probe into cryptographically secure pseudo random number generation. After exploring the different definitions, you will be able to observe how to implement encryption, decryption, transparent data encryption (TDE) and hashing in SQL Server. We will pay special attention to areas where the choice of encryption technology affects your database maintenance and recovery strategies. After attending the session, you will be able to identify the right technology to use in your specific use case and you will have the basic knowledge to start implementing it immediately.
