## Title: Using SQL Server, Powershell and Power BI together - achieve amaz
## Abstract:
### SQL Server, Powershell and Power BI are very powerful and capable technologies on their own. When used together, they can help to achieve much more. We can create end-to-end solutions, automate processes, create very cost-effective, interactive and robust monitoring, testing and analyses solutions. During the presentation I will show different demos which will demonstrate different ways that we could use this powerful trio to solve real-world problems.
