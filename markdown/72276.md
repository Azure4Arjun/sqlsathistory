## Title: A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Indexes
## Abstract:
### Indexes can be a boon or detriment for database performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will focus on a deep dive into clustered indexes, Primary Keys, and nonclustered indexes (including B-tree traversal), their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail.  There will be many live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using statistics and query plans. Some knowledge of Management Studio and TSQL is recommended.
