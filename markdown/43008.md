## Title: Execution Plans: What Can You Do With Them?
## Abstract:
### People are aware that you can use an execution plan to tune a query, but do they have other uses? This session will drill down on all the hidden information within execution plans. The structures and information with an execution plan shows many of the inner workings of SQL Server. From calculated columns to referential integrity, these, and many other functions, are exposed through execution plans. From this session youâ€™ll be able to better understand the inner workings of SQL Server as well as your own databases and queries.
