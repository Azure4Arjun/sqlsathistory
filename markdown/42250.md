## Title: Understanding Windows Azure High Availability Options for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure provides an excellent IaaS platform for deploying SQL Server. Although Microsoft is managing the infrastructure, you still need to plan for high availability and disaster recovery. In this session, learn how to leverage Azure Fault Domains, Upgrade Domains, and Internal Load Balancers to ensure the high availability of SQL Server deployments within the Azure cloud. Learn the difference between Azure Classic and Azure Resource Manager and how both affect your SQL Server availability.

While Microsoft Azure offers SLA's of 99.95%, you have to know what to do to make sure your SQL Server deployment qualifies. Don't miss this session if you are moving or have moved your SQL Servers instances to Azure. This session assumes you have a basic knowledge of SQL Server AlwaysOn Failover Clustering as well as Availability Groups.
