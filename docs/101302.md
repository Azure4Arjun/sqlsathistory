## Title: The function of Windowing Functions
## Abstract:
### In the past, we have all had the need to return a result set and provide information on this with regard to a persons previous or future records.  Or, alternatively, you have needed to get a single record for an individual - maybe the first, maybe the last.  Doing this without windowing functions is possible but why punish yourself?!  Come to learn about general windowing functions that we should all know, as well as some that you may not be aware of!  Did you know you can use count(*) as a windowed function in addition to general aggregate?
