## Title: Let's Talk About Your Model: Simple Modeling Solutions to Complex Problems
## Abstract:
### With examples of real problems and (attempted) solutions, this presentation will examine dimensional modeling techniques which simplify and speed up measure evaluation. A fast-paced and language/tool-agnostic look at some common and uncommon reporting scenarios, including:
•	All manner of date calculations and comparisons
•	Slowly changing dimensions
•	Events in progress
•	Conditional evaluation of measures
 
By the end of this talk, you should have a stronger understanding of the right questions to ask that will make your BI solution simpler for end users and more performant at run-time.
