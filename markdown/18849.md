## Title: Database Development using SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### In 2007, Microsoft introduced Data Dude for Visual Studio 2005 to help bring the processes, controls and tools for code management to Database Development that Application developers had been enjoying for ages.  It had its problems, but it mostly worked and was a welcome step in the right direction. Many versions later we have SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2013 (and 2012 and 2010...). A more mature product that finally brings database development up to par with traditional application development and has many features data geeks, like ourselves, will truly love. This talk will provide an overview of SSDTâ€™s features and show you how to get started using it to save time, implement better code controls and be a better DBA or database developer.
