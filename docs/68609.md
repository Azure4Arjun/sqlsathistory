## Title: Power BI: Performance Tips  Tricks
## Abstract:
### Thanks to the rapid, community-driven release cycle, Microsoft Power BI has caught and overtaken many visualisation tools and now sits alongside Tableau at the top of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for 2017. It is fast becoming the first-choice reporting tool for both small and large organisations. 

However, as with all reporting tools, if the underlying data model is badly designed or custom measures/calculations are poorly written, performance can really suffer. Whether you are designing the front-end for a carefully crafted warehouse, or performing an ad-hoc analysis exercise, you can follow some best practice advice to ensure youâ€™re getting the best out of your reports.

This 1 hour session will range from quick development wins to more strategic, enterprise considerations.  The session also aims to explain ad-hoc transformations within the Query Editor and demonstrates best practices for encouraging Query Folding.  Designed for all levels of Power BI expertise.
