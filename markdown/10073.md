## Title: Building BI Semantic Model Tabular in 60 minutes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduces the new Analysis Services Tabular Mode. BI Semantic Model (BISM) Tabular is in-memory database in Analysis Services using state-of-the-art compression algorithms. BI Semantic Models can be developed in either Visual Studio or in Excel using the SQL Server 2012 PowerPivot add-in. In this session, I will show you how to build a complete solution in Tabular and creating one from the ground up, deploy a rich semantic model and discover a simpler method for analyzing business data. You also learn the basics of DAX language and how to manage role based security and partitioning in a Tabular model. You will be able to create your BISM Tabular models, and gain a solid background to enable you starting your next project.
