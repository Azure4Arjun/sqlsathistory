## Title: The usual SUSPECTs: When good databases go bad.
## Abstract:
### You just restarted SQL Server, but some of your databases aren't coming online. Maybe 
you see a database marked SUSPECT, or RECOVERY PENDING. What do you do? In this session
we'll cover the various states that a database can be in, how they get into those states, and 
learn the proper techniques to bring your data safely back online.
