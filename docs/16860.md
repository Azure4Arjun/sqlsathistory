## Title: Managing Database Changes with Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### As systems grow and evolve, we need tools to help manage these changes, including tracking changes to the database schemas, producing scripts to synchronize the changes between servers, and refactoring the corresponding application code based on the new structures. You'll see how you can use tools in Visual Studio to help manage these changes better.
