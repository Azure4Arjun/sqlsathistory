## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: ETL Head-to-Head: T-SQL vs. SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll compare ETL strategies between SQL Server Integration Services and plain old T-SQL. Is one better than the other? Should I just use SSIS and skip T-SQL altogether, or vice versa? We'll address these questions and more, and will take a look at some practical examples and a few head-to-head comparisons using both tools. 
Seesion Goals: 
•Attendees will gain an understanding of the role of Transact-SQL as part of an ETL strategy. 
•Attendees will gain an understanding of the logistical differences between using SSIS and Transact-SQL for ETL processing. 
•Attendees will learn, through practical demonstration, some situations that may be better served by Transact-SQL rather than SSIS (and the reverse).
