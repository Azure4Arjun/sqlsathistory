## Title: Hailing Frequencies: SSAS Terms and Concepts
## Abstract:
### In this Star Trek-themed presentation, we will explain the terms and concepts important to understand when participating in projects involving SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

You’ll learn the key differences between SSAS Multidimensional Model (Cubes) and SSAS Tabular Model. You’ll also learn the definitions and examples of key terms for each model, including but not limited to: measure groups, measures, dimensions, attributes, and hierarchies in the SSAS Multidimensional Model and tables, columns, and calculated measures in the SSAS Tabular Model. We will also demonstrate the basics of browsing of both Multidimensional and Tabular models using Excel 2013.
