## Title: Azure SQL Managed Instances - A *mostly* full-featured SQL Server in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### In this session we will compare the offerings of Azure SQL Databases, then dig in and show what separates SQL Managed Instances from the rest. Weâ€™ll take a look at challenges that previously prevented migrations to Azure, the current features available, some common architectures, and backup and restore options.
