## Title: PowerShell Cubed: Backing up and Restoring Analysis Services Cubes with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Did you know that the SQLPS module, now called SqlServer module, includes everything that you need to backup, restore, and many other things of SQL Analysis Services cubes? 

Far too often sessions cover using PowerShell to backup and restore SQL Server databases, but not backup and restores of AS cubes. This is NOT a talk about what AS is or how to build a new cube. This is a talk about AS management from the perspective of a DBA. Weâ€™ll talk about different ways to perform a backup and ways to perform a restore with PowerShell.
