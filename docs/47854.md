## Title: Metadata-driven schema evolution - building robust ELT workflows
## Abstract:
### Hadoop excels at running many large ETL/ELT workflows that previously ran on more expensive proprietary platforms. But when legacy tools and techniques are simply ported to work with Hadoop, they often bring the same legacy issues - brittleness due to their inability to support rapidly changing data sources and structures. And when more resilient processes are built to support an agile data lake, they often forgo metadata management, which makes later consumption by applications and users more difficult.

This presentation will discuss combining a metadata-driven schema evolution platform with existing tools in the Hadoop ecosystem (especially Hive and Impala) to:
* Gracefully handle schema evolution of data sources during extraction
* Drive more robust ingestion and processing workflows
* Lower effort and cost of integrating new data sources
* Enable first class metadata query operations / applications
* Support data governance requirements
