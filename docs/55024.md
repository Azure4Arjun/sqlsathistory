## Title: Power BI Data Governance - Protecting Business Data
## Abstract:
### This session allows companies to think about the security and architecture of their Power BI deployment. Power BI is self service analytics. Users are quick to create a group work spaces without any thought. IT and organizations need to design a business friendly architecture that protects the business data without impacting the users ability to build their reports and dashboards. Users are also quick to change the data model or report without thinking of the negative impact. A strategy for delivering the changes needs to be put into place. This prevents presenting invalid reports or dashboards during the development or advancement stage of updating reports and dashboards.
