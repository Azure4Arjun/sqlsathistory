## Title: Calling the doctor to the number "DMV"
## Abstract:
### Many times we find server problems, perform multiple changes in codes, configurations, server architecture and often do not have greater results. It's time to ask SQL Server, inquire DMV (Dynamic Management Views and functions), in this session we will see how we can enhance, our administration and development tasks using DMV to know the queries are the ones most executed.  Which ones are queries generating locks? Which indexes we use and we donâ€™t? Among some other relevant topics.
