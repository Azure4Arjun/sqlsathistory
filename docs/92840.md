## Title: CI/CD for your Cloud Data Platform from Data Lake to Power BI
## Abstract:
### On the one hand, traditional Enterprise Data Warehouses are transforming into modern Data Platforms. On the other hand, onPremise systems are moving to PaaS services in the cloud.

These changes come with the challenge of an increasing number of components that have to be manged. However, they provide the benefit of the flexibility and scalability of PaaS services.

This presentation will demonstrate how to build a full modern data platform with CI/CD. Resources will be deployed as ARM templates, a Data Lake is configured and created, a database is deployed, in addition, Azure Analysis Services is configured and finally Power BI reports are deployed to Power BI workspaces. The platforms' glue are Azure Data Factory including the brand new ADF Mapping Flows and Azure Functions.

This enables to spin up a fully configured environment within minutes.

The presentation will demonstrate how to integrate all above technologies based on Azure DevOps.
