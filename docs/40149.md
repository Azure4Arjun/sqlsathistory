## Title: Convert from T-SQL to MDX queries
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Analysis Services has become a key base of Business Intelligence integration into business decision making.  As DBAâ€™s sometimes we are forced to change over to new coding standards.  MDX is one of the base languages used when reporting off of cubes that are built using the multi-dimensional model.  The goal of this class will be to help beginners convert from using T-SQL to understanding the basics when writing MDX queries from scratch.
