## Title: Your User Feedback - in 2 Hours or Less - Part 2: Hunter Gatherer
## Abstract:
### Our users are constantly generating valuable data that we, as the business, could leverage.  Unfortunately, capturing and analyzing this data has been a costly endeavor both from a development standpoint as well as being labor intensive from an entry point of view.  That is until now.
Microsoft Power Platform now gives us the tools required to quickly development, store, and review our userâ€™s data in 2 hours or less.
In part two of this session, we will develop the transmission of data via Flow, and develop reporting on the data leveraging Power BI.
