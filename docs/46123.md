## Title: Power BI  - Explore SQL Server Database and Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a powerful analytics tool. It allows users to easily shape and transform their data into actionable insights in a very short period of time. Weâ€™ll explore how the tool can connect to your SQL Server database and allow you to visualize Database and Performance Metrics, such as, file size, Buffer Pool and Plan Cache, Wait Stats and more. We will create visualizations and reports in Power BI Desktop using SQL queries, publish that information to the Power BI Service, and walk through sharing and mobile consumption. The goal of this session is to provide you with a better understanding of how to leverage Power BI for yourself and your organization.
