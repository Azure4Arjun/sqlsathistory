## Title: Disk IO Tuning for Microsoft SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Tuning disk subsystems for optimal SQL Server performance is typically the domain
of very experienced, enterprise DBAs. It normally requires years of experience the hard disk
subsystem to learn exactly what configurations perform best, provide the greatest fault tolerance,
and allow for the most scalability. This session removes the need for those years of experience
by answering questions like:

How does RAID compare to SAN, hard disk to SSD?
What is needed to properly monitor and tune the performance of my disk subsystem?
How do I tune my SQL Server for improved IO performance?

Configuring hardware can be very intimidating, especially when the application needs to scale.
