# Get data insights faster with Data Wrangling
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Sergiy Lunyakin
## Title: Get data insights faster with Data Wrangling
## Abstract:
### Self-Service Data Preparation aka Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. Traditional approach doesn't work here, data analysts and data scientists have to wait until IT guys gather requirements and prepare a right dataset for them. Time from raw data to insights is too long. In this session, I invite you together look closer at Self-Service Data Prep and show how it would help to get insights and make decisions faster, onboard new data sources without IT, and increase efficiency for data analysts and data scientists.

## Speaker: Mihail Mateev
## Title: Choosing the Right Database for Microservices Solutions
## Abstract:
### The past years have seen the explosive growth of large-scale distributed systems. This trend has changed the database world that is arguably without precedent in the history of the software industry. The result is a ompetitive database marketplace with a huge variety of platforms for us to choose from. But how do we go about making the right choices?

In this talk we will discuss how we can go about choosing the right database models for your application.  We will also look at how the choice of data models can help determine which technologies to include in your data tier.

Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Pavel Malek
## Title: Score a (row) goal and beat a query optimizer
## Abstract:
### Query optimizer is a magical piece of architecture inside SQL Server which instructs the engine how your query is going to be executed. It performs a great job …unless it doesn’t. 

In this session we will have a deep look on cases where the query optimizer fails and explain why is it happening. Expect to see a real code written by real developers which will be tuned just in front of you to perform several times faster. If you want to (or possibly need to) take control of execution plan, this session is right for you!

## Speaker: Andrey Nikolov
## Title: The hidden power of Power BI or what we can do using Power BI REST API
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a very powerful tool. But behind the shiny UI, Power BI REST API gives you even more features to create better solutions! In this session we will make one simple report from scratch and then we will explore what you can do using Power BI REST API and what you can’t (at least not yet!). I will demonstrate how your program can authenticate itself (both in interactive and non-interactive way), how it can add new rows to a dataset or refresh it programmatically, and how to share one dataset between multiple reports. By the end of this session we will get a complete reporting solution, with a monthly cost as a decent pizza! :)

# Query tuning when indexes cannot help
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: Query tuning when indexes cannot help
## Abstract:
### Creating an index seems to be a silver bullet for optimizing a performance of a query. If this is true, then most of performance problems seems to go away, but they exist. And there are lots of cases when creating yet another index doesn't help. When do indexes help and when do you need to just take a different approach - rewriting the query for removing bad patterns. In this session I will show you how to decide to create an index or not, and which query patterns don't benefit from indexes. You will see some reason of the plan warnings, cardinality errors, and how to avoid them.

# The Maths behind Machine Learning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Matt Willis
## Title: The Maths behind Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### The new world of Machine Learning can sound quite overwhelming! Do I need a PhD in Machine Learning to get involved? The answer, thankfully, is no. But what you do need, which is often neglected, is a solid understanding of the theory behind the models.

This session will look to do just that, looking at some of the most popular algorithms used today, we will explore the maths involved, to help us understand our problems and get the best results possible. We will be also diving into practical examples, using Databricks to consume a dataset and to visualise results, with R scripts to execute the Machine Learning models.

If you would like an introduction to the world of Machine Learning and to acquire a solid grounding that will help you develop the skill, then this is the session for you.

# RC, SI, and RCSI -It's So Confusing. Which Should You Use?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Arnie Rowland
## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI -It's So Confusing. Which Should You Use?
## Abstract:
### I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

## Abstract:
### Do you want to access data from a REST API with Power BI? Willing to know more about data connectors and the Power Query M language? Welcome on board! This session will show you, with a real use-case, what’s a data connector and how to build it. Starting with the definition of a function, going through authorization and finally packaging the whole is a nice journey that we’ll follow during the next 60 minutes.

# Chatbots for Dummies
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Jose Mendes
## Title: Chatbots for Dummies
## Abstract:
### The software development landscape is changing. More and more, there is an increased demand for AI and cloud solutions.  As a user buying cinema tickets online, I would like to simply ask "I want to buy two cinema tickets for the movie Dunkirk, tomorrow's viewing at 1pm" instead of manually following a pre-defined process. 

In this session, we will learn how to build, debug and deploy a chatbot using the Azure Bot Service. We will enrich it using the Microsoft Cognitive suite to achieve human like interactions. 

Will it pass the Turing test, no, but we can extend the bot service using Machine Learning (LUIS), APIs (Web Apps) and Worflows (Logic Apps).

## Title: How do SQL DB projects support DB scheme and help you make weekly or daily releases?
## Abstract:
### I will present a perspective how you can easily support and update DB scheme by SQL Server Db Project, how it helps to make fast and quick releases. What is the right branch strategy, automatization and continuous integration. You can see how SQL server DB Project helps you prepare update script, easy comparison between PRO and Dev Db scheme without direct access to PRO. How each Developer will own Dev Db for 2 – 3 seconds. How you can make fast and safety refactoring of the name of column, table, view, sp and so on. What is the right way to structure DB Project? How we can make an easy code review of DB change by Developers?

# Bringing DevOps to your database
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#711---Plovdiv-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Radoslav Gatev
## Title: Bringing DevOps to your database
## Abstract:
### Application code deployment is an easy thing as long as it is stateless. But what about the databases which are intrinsically stateful?
Have you ever deployed a new release of your database schema manually? How sure were you that you followed 100% of the steps from you deployment list. Do you feel nervous when the time for a new release comes by?
I will show you how to introduce the DevOps principles to your databases in order to be much effective in your business and significantly reduce the lead time.
The technologies we are going to have in our tool belts are SQL Server Database Tools, Azure Resource Manager and Release Management in VSTS(Visual Studio Team Services). For the advanced scenarios, we will take a look at Build  Deployment Contributors.
