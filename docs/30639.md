## Title: Building Your First SQL Cluster
## Abstract:
### Interested in high availability, but don't know where to start? This session will start at the ground level and work through all the requirements of building a SQL Cluster environment, including Windows steps, storage steps, and networking needs.

This will include a brief on what is coming down the pipe in Denali.

 Of course, SQL Server will be included in this process.
