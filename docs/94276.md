## Title: Hacking SQL Server Is Not Enough
## Abstract:
### You already know how easy it is to hack SQL Server… But how do you protect your local and cloud servers against enemy agent attacks?
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants. Both exploits and security recommendations to avoid them will be covered.
Disclaimer: No actual crimes will be committed. Please do not send agents to my house again.
