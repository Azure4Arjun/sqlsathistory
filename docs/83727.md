## Title: Introduction to Biml - Generating your SSIS packages from scratch
## Abstract:
### Working on your 20th staging package? Do you need to import 30 different flat files? Don't have the time to create all those packages?
With Biml - Business Intelligence Markup Language - you can cut back on development time by

* generating your SSIS packages and database object using metadata.
* turning tedious, repetitive work into reusable scripts.
* automating general ETL patterns.

In this session, we will go over the basics of Biml and BimlScript and learn how we can use metadata to create a framework for automating your data integration tasks. After this session, you can start with the automation of your SSIS packages.
 
A working knowledge of Integration Services package development is necessary.
