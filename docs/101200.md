## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: The Art of Data Classification and Protection
## Abstract:
### Government regulations are increasing! Data breaches are being reported almost daily. Do you know what type of data is in the database and what data should be classified?  
In this session, we will learn why and how to classify the data in our databases.  SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has options to help us classify data. Let’s go into depth and see how to use the Data Discovery and Classification tool along with the Information Protection Policy tool found inside SSMS. Once the data is classified, let’s report on the data we classified. Lastly, let’s set up auditing and find out who is accessing the classified data.
You will leave the session with a clear understanding of how to properly classify, report and audit the newly classified data, allowing us to better adhere to compliance regulations. 
Prerequisites: Having an understanding of data privacy regulation is recommended and a desire to learn how to protect data with which you have been entrusted.
