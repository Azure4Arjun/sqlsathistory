## Title: Building your first SSIS package made easy
## Abstract:
### In this session I will walk you through a complete SSIS package from scratch to finish. The package will hit some of the key SSIS components in the control and data flow and along the way I will emphasize best practices that should always be followed. We will also cover variables and setting expressions on the variables to make the package the dynamic.
