## Title: Design considerations and patterns for creating a supportable Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### So you've built a flashy new Data Warehouse and deployed it to production. 

Great now what?

Nobody wants to be involved with a project that is constantly failing and difficult to support.
This session will take a look at some design considerations and tips to ensure that your mart runs with minimal intervention and is easy to support.

The tools discussed and used in the examples will be SSIS and SQL server but many of the points discussed are valid for all tools.
