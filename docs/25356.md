## Title: Get your Mining Model Predictions out to all. Presentation en Francais
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012: Over the past 18 months many financial and portfolio management firms have been severely ‘hit’ by the depressed markets and poor economic conditions.This lead to risk exposure and considerable client liability.We like many firms have gone through the 'teething process'with regards to data mining model predictions and have now taken our systems from the prototype stage to our “shop floor” and are getting the 'good word' out to management via SQL Server Reporting Services.
