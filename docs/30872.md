## Title: Data Late Than Never
## Abstract:
### How to Fill in the Gaps for Missing Data
When ETL lookups don’t match this can be a problem.  In the case of ETL processing over large data sets, having to figure out the missed match conditions for large numbers of rows can be a problem.  In the case of a dimensional warehouse, when you are processing large numbers of fact rows that have a lookup dependency, and you cannot get a match, what can you do?  We’ll discuss strategies such as 
1. Late Arriving Dimensions and Facts
2. Using a default values. 
2. Use multiple default values.
3. Creating a partially populated dimension row for a late arriving dimension.
4. Using “Level Of Confidence” pattern matching techniques
