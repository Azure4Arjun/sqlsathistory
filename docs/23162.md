## Title: Designing for Analysis: Facts and Dimensions
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on patterns and practices that are successful in designing Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence solutions. Designing an analytic database is different from designing a transactional database. This presentation will provide thorough coverage into the foundation of analytic database design: Facts and Dimensions. We'll also discuss the Star and Snowflake schema, dimension hierarchies, multiple calendar dimensions and how all of this fits with the query and reporting tools used to actually present information.
