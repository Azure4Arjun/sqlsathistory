## Speaker: Andrew Brust
## Title: Hadoop and its Ecosystem Components in Action
## Abstract:
### It’s one thing to have a high-level understanding of Big Data, Hadoop and MapReduce; it’s quite another to feel comfortable working with the tools. In this demo-heavy session, ZDNet Big Data blogger and Visual Studio magazine columnist Andrew Brust will take a look at actual MapReduce code and see Hadoop ecosystem components HBase, Hive, Pig and Mahout in action.
