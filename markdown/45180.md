## Title: WIT-Diversity Panel: Parenting Daughters in an IT world  Why Its Important
## Abstract:
### Join Justin Dearing, Patrick LeBlanc, Arlene Rose and Rie Irish to discuss raising daughters as a parent involved in IT.  Parenting is hard.  We all know that.  Parenting girls is really hard.  Adding to an already complicated job, is our technology based way of thinking  problem solving.   The IT field isn't very diverse, but we have the opportunity to change that in a generation: encouraging young females, calling out other biases in the field and coming up with positive solutions.  Are we raising tech savvy daughters? Should we be?
