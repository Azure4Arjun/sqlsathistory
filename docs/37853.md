## Title: Testing T-SQL Code with tSQLt
## Abstract:
### Unit-Test are a mature tool in traditional programming languages like C# and meanwhile accepted as de-facto standard. Using Stored Procedures and Functions you can put much programming logic right into the database. This logic has to be tested too. SQL Server Data Tools from Microsoft are one possible approach to generate unit tests for T-SQL Code. One of the disadvantages of SSDT is that the tests are implemented as C# or VB Solutions outside of the database. An alternative to these approach is using tSQLt, a Testing-Framework that is written entirely in T-SQL and is run completely in the database. So you are able to write unit tests in SQL Server Management Studio. In his talk SQL Server MVP Frank Geisler will show how the tSQLt Framework is set up and how it works and how you can write Unit Tests for different SQL Server Objects. Besides the free Version of tSQLt you can buy SQL Test from Redgate which is a very useful GUI for tSQLt and is demonstrated as well.
