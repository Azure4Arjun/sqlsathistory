## Speaker: Don Stevic
## Title: The Fundamentals of DBA-ism 
## Abstract:
### When I was a freshly minted DBA and trying to learn the ropes, my manager used to tell me “You should know that, that’s DBA 101”. As much as it frustrated me, he was right. There is a core set of knowledge that DBA. Correct SQL installation and configuration, how’s and whys of backups, how to make your role proactive, and many other things fall under that heading. This session is for the “freshly minted” DBA to help them find and define their own set of best practices.
