## Speaker: George Mauer
## Title: TDD With No Tears
## Abstract:
### Unit testing is hard to get right. Are you testing too much? Too little? How do you write tests that aren't a waste of time? Isn't testing supposed to enable refactoring? Then why do they seem to be in the way? What's this BDD thing I keep hearing about? Do we need to learn yet another tool?

This talk goes deep into the philosophy behind unit testing in general and test-driven development in particular. We will discuss how to keep things simple yet useful and showcase a strategy for writing tests that achieve our goals without wasting everybody's time.
