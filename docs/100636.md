## Title: Taking Your Dashboard From Good To Great
## Abstract:
### Putting together an initial dashboard can have its own challenges. However, what does it take to go from a dashboard that meets requirements to one that shines and dazzles?

This talk will look at best practices for which types of visuals to use, as well as which should be averted and why.  We will dig into things like colors to avoid, good charts and bad charts, and ways to maximize the visual real estate.
