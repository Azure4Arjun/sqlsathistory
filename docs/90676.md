## Speaker: Andrew Nakamura
## Title: Do-It-Yourself Performance Monitoring
## Abstract:
### If you had an unlimited budget, any problem is easy to fix.  But when users complain and your boss is hovering around your desk, and you don't have Platinum bucks, what can you do to  ensure your SQL Servers are maintained and optimized properly?  In this session, we'll dive through performance monitoring and building baselines using open source scripts that give you super powers to even go back in time and diagnose problems that are no longer available.  

Do you have processes that block or deadlocks queries but are no longer running?  Do you have power users that do some questionable reports or a rogue developer with sysadmin access?  How do you resolve them if they're not using the system when you have eyes on them?

Finally, you will walk away from this session with a plan that can be implemented tomorrow and never be caught off guard again.  You will look like a superhero that can be proud of performance monitoring system that you built yourself.  Come join the fun!
