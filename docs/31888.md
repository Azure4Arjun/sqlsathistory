## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: As a DBA, Where Do I Start?!
## Abstract:
### Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on its responsibility or joining a new company with previous experience, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority form. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also look at some of the available tools and scripts to help see where our environments rate. Mike emphasizes our role as "Protector of the Data" as a DBA throughout.
