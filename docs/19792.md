## Title: SQLCAT - Building scalable  cloud applications
## Abstract:
### The SQLCAT team has successfully architected, designed and built over 50 SQL Server cloud projects. We want to share the learnings on how to design a cloud application to scale to handle large, complex workloads using Windows Azure SQL Database. Building cloud applications are different than building on premise database driven applications.
