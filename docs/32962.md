## Title: Database design for developers
## Abstract:
### As a developer there are a few things you'll want to know about database design.  How can you build tables optimized for high transaction volume?  How can referential integrity checks save you from building extra validation code into your applications? We'll cover how and when to add indexing to your tables for performance gains.  Finally we'll briefly cover views, functions, and triggers, and when you should avoid them.
