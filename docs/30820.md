## Title: *GASP* Real-time user defined sets in SSAS
## Abstract:
### Given in the form of a case study, this session will highlight a real-life implementation done of an interesting user request.  Using the functionality of SharePoint, SSIS, and SSAS attendees of this session will learn how to give analyists the ability to generate, define, and immediately use Custom Defined sets in an Analysis Services cube.

This session will highlight some of the power of SharePoint lists, third party SSIS providers, and many-to-many relationships in SSAS cubes.  Additionally, the flexibilty of this solution will be shown though the use of several different user reporting tools.
