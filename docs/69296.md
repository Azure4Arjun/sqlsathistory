## Title: AlwaysOn from the Front Lines
## Abstract:
### Ready? Aim? Fire AlwaysOn with the wizard and just keeping next'n next and you'll Almost get AlwaysOn On. In a perfect world, it would just work? What do you do when it doesn't? When the wizard breaks in the middle what are the troubleshooting steps you need to do? How do you test your background plan? Learn where to look and more importantly what to do when the wizard just ran out of magic dust and leaves you in the red! Learn from my mistakes which can save you hours of troubleshooting. Planning is the key to a successful implementation, but even that can be a challenge with hidden knowns. 

Beginners as well as experts will learn from my experience with AlwaysOn. Don't just keep pushing that NEXT button until you come and join my session.
