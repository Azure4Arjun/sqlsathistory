## Title: Advanced Performance Diagnostics in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The SQL Administrator must ensures optimal
database performance with comprehensive database, storage
and virtualization monitoring, along with advanced workload
analytics. The diagnostic have to integrate transaction workload investigations
with database resource monitoring for a seamless workflow.
While database resource monitoring ensures that database
components operate within their limits — and alerts database
administrators (DBAs) when they’re overextended — transaction
workload analysis measures and analyzes the SQL that
connects users to resources, enabling management of database
service levels.
