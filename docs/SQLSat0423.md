## Speaker: Scott Swanberg
## Title: Exploring Your SQL Server Databases with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### As a DBA and performance tuning consultant, for Ambient Consulting in Minneapolis, I'm often asked to analyze performance issues on a SQL Server instance with which I'm unfamiliar. It can be a daunting task. Let's face it, most of the time companies do not have good documentation about their databases. Or if they do, it is outdated, or it takes a few days to locate and retrieve it.

In this present, I share a set of basic scripts that I've developed, over the years, which mine the metadata in the various system functions, stored procedures, tables, catalog views, and dynamic management views, Together, they reveal all the secrets of the databases on the instance, their size, file locations, and their design, including columns, data types, defaults, keys and indexes.  You will walk away with 40 scripts to reverse engineer a database

# Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular
## Abstract:
### The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.
