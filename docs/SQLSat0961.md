# Datacenter and/or Cloud - When to Use One, the Other, or Both
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#961---Albany-2020-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 25-07-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Datacenter and/or Cloud - When to Use One, the Other, or Both
## Abstract:
### As with all other items in your toolbox the datacenter (local or in the cloud) needs to be used correctly. 

This session will show the various types and sizes of workloads, show you how to categorize them, look at the requirements of your SLA (Service Level Agreement), and find the right location (cloud, datacenter, hybrid) for the data. To wrap things up, we look at ways to validate that the SLA can be fulfilled and how to estimate and compare the costs.

# Is my Server having Memory Pressure and how do I find the source
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#961---Albany-2020-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 25-07-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Dave Bland
## Title: Is my Server having Memory Pressure and how do I find the source
## Abstract:
### As we all know, SQL Server loves memory and will use as much as it can get.  However, when there is memory pressure we need to use our DBA skills to identify what is causing the pressure.  During this session we will explore how SQL Server uses memory and how to properly configure memory settings.  We will discuss the use of DMVs and other tools to help us find what is consuming the most memory and some potential solutions.

# Window Functions in SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#961---Albany-2020-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 25-07-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Window Functions in SQL
## Abstract:
### No, they don't have anything to do with the operating by the same name. Instead, window functions allow us to calculate a single value based on a set of rows, and we have extraordinary control over which rows get used as the inputs. We'll start by covering what a window function is and will discuss the syntax and usage of the OVER clause in detail.  We will also cover the three classes of window functions (ranking, aggregate and analytic) with focus on some commonly used functions as well some "gotchas" with some of these functions. You will learn how this class of functions can help you write more performant code.

# Need to Monitor Any Azure Resource? Must Learn Kusto Query Language
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#961---Albany-2020-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 25-07-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Taiob Ali
## Title: Need to Monitor Any Azure Resource? Must Learn Kusto Query Language
## Abstract:
### Kusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data, easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to the cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of ‘Azure Monitor.’ Whether you are ‘detecting and diagnose issues across applications,’ ‘correlate infrastructure issues for VMs,’ ‘drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics,’ you will be using ‘Azure Monitor.’ Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, KQL must be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.

In this 95% demo session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. Come and learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.

## Speaker: Kevin Mackey
## Title: Graph Databases–How and Why
## Abstract:
### We, as data professionals, are dealing with increasingly large amounts of data. And, increasingly, we're asked to generate insights from this data. For that, the relationships between data points matter more than simple aggregations of individual data points. In our interconnected world, interconnected businesses, interconnected applications, graph databases lend themselves to answering relationship questions far more easily than...relational databases.

In this session we'll look at graph databases for
	how to model graph databases
	how to easily express relationships between interconnected data
	how to efficiently retrieve interrelated data 

We'll look at the MATCH predicate in T-SQL and the MATCH statement in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j.

# Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#961---Albany-2020-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 25-07-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance
## Abstract:
### Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.

## Speaker: Andy Levy
## Title: Keys to a Healthy Relationship with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Developers and DBAs have had a long, sometimes strained relationship. Some developers see DBAs as roadblocks standing in the way of getting their work shipped; some DBAs see developers as agents of chaos bent on ruining their perfect database environments.

In this talk designed for application and database developers, we’ll talk about why SQL Server behaves the way it does, common database and query design pain points, and how we look for them. With real-world examples and tales of troublesome T-SQL, past and present, you’ll start to get a picture of what to do and not to do in your applications. Along the way, you’ll learn how to build a better relationship with both SQL Server and the DBAs responsible for it.
