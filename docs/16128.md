## Title: Real-world Fuzzy matching  with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Fuzzy Lookup and Fuzzy Grouping in SSIS are two powerful transformations that allow you to match inputs by providing a similarity threshold. In this presentation you will learn how to implement Fuzzy Lookup and Fuzzy Grouping in real-world scenarios such as matching individuals by a series of attributes, creating master or header records for Master Data Management as well as implementing data cleansing for Data Quality frameworks.
