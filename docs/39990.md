## Title: Click  Clone - a simple model for managing data quality and scaling out 
## Abstract:
### With retail businesses operating in multiple sales channels, the velocity of sales data and the quality of that data can vary greatly.

This is a key consideration when designing the operational characteristics of your backroom ETL subsystems, that stage and transform sales data into usable FACTs.

Cloning of key tables and utilising a parallel processing ETL stream, enables cookie cutter software development and controlled, synchronised loading of FACTs into the data warehouse presentation layer. The use of dynamically created table clones can reduce database entity clutter, optimise the development and execution of Fact Creation SSIS packages and improve data quality  auditing.

These elements are crucial to scaling out the data warehouse solution as the business grows.

In this session I will review the design, describe the basic components and demonstrate the core functionality.
