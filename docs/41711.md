## Title: Using big data to drive U.S. healthcare reform
## Abstract:
### A big-data revolution is underway in healthcare. Over the past decade payers and providers have been digitizing patient records into medical databases, including data from patients covered under private and public insurance programs. During this same timeframe technological advances have made it easier to collect and analyze information from different sources including payers, hospitals, laboratories and physician offices.  In this session we will explore how McKinsey Healthcare Analytics manages and analyzes large databases with billions of records of highly sensitive information and produce market changing insights on the U.S. healthcare landscape. What are the challenges? How can we make sense of highly heterogeneous data? In what ways can we visualize the data to make it valuable?
