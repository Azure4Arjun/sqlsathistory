## Title: Why Learn Python?  A Microsoft DB/ETL/BI Developer's Answer
## Abstract:
### You're a Microsoft Developer.  C#, MSSQL, SSIS/SSRS, SSMS, and Azure are your tools of choice.  Why would you want to learn Python?  In this session, I will show you several take-home utilities that use Python.  The first hunts through a folder structure full of SSIS packages looking for the one(s) that load(s) a specified table.  The second executes the data sources in an SSRS report to identify performance problems and document them in Excel.  The third GeoCodes the City/Country names from a SQL table, getting the Lat/Lng so you can use the data in maps.  Familiarity with Python is not necessary to use the utilities, but we're not going to do Hello World either.  This is real Python for Microsoft Database, ETL and BI Developers.  This all-demo session shows you how to use Python with the .Net CLR,  XML, ODBC, Excel, SQL Server, and Web API calls.
