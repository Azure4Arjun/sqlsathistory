## Speaker: Robert Hatton
## Title: Thinking in SQL
## Abstract:
### SQL is conceptually different than most programming languages. Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at. Beginners will get a great introduction to the style of thought that gets the most out of SQL. Experienced developers will find a good refresher and an opportunity to share their experiences with others.
