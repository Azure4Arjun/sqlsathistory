## Title: Fixing performance problems - Stuff happens
## Abstract:
### I will discuss tricky tuning issues that I have encountered during my years speeding up SQL Server. Simple rules often don't apply to complex problems. SQL Server queries can have a wide variety of complexities.
Slow queries are caused by these issues: 1. data might be retrieved from disk or RAM 2. row estimates are too high or too low 3. functions are zero costed 4. the optimizer doesn't know the value of a local variable 5. a query is too complex for the optimizer to do a great job 6. indexes compete for RAM 7. optional parameters 8. a high cost query only using 1 cpu 9. table variables  10. the optimizer isn't perfect
