## Title: Become a SQL Block’stroyer
## Abstract:
### In order to implement ACID properties, SQL Server uses locks to control who can have access to what resources. In this session we will discuss how to leverage the different isolation levels within SQL Server to affect locking behavior. Before taking a deep dive into how to detect, mitigate, and possibly eliminate certain types of blocking in the system, we will explore some of the basic lock types and how they interact. Once we have learned how to deal with classic blocks in this fast paced demo filled session, we will explore several real world strategies to mitigate the dreaded deadlock. Be prepared to enter this session as a DBA but leave as a SQL Block’stroyer!
