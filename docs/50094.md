## Title: Building Stronger Relationships Between Us... "Data People" and Them... "End Users"
## Abstract:
### The role of data and IT professionals is evolving from simply responding to requests about business to one of helping shape the business strategy. The integration of these professionals into the strategy process is a transformation that presents communication challenges and requires more visibility by people typically known to be introverts. In this session we will discuss some of the barriers causing relationship pains as well as some techniques and strategies to begin building stronger relationships with the managers and end users so data can thrive and customer satisfaction can proliferate.
