## Title: It's full of Star Schemasâ€¦ 
## Abstract:
### Whether you are using Excel, Tableau, PowerPivot, SSAS Multi-dimensional or Tabular, QlikView, or just plain old SQL, most of the time you will get better results in less time if you can source the data from a star schema.  

In this session we will cover the core principles of a star schema dimensional data model.  This will include the different types of dimension attributes, dimension hierarchies, types of fact tables, and  types of measures.
