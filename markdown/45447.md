## Title: Windowed Functions - Harness the Power to Forecast with Ease!
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will do a brief walk through of what windowed functions are, how they execute, and the power that can be realized with them to do advanced computations such as moving averages, running totals, and forecasting. Once we get into the forecasting piece, we will walk through a forecasting model and show how we can leverage windowed functions to take complex calculations and make them easy to interpret. We will also illustrate why windowed functions are much more efficient than the typical update/inner join aggregate for running totals.
At the end of this session, the goal is to empower you to go back to your organization and be able to build a forecasting model in just T-SQL.
