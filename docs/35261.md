## Title: Disk Performance Hands On
## Abstract:
### Would you buy a million dollar race car then show up to the track on a clear day with rain tires that aren’t properly inflated and wonder why you’re only doing 180 when the manufacturer says it can do 220?

Your answer was probably close to something like “Of course not!”. Now let’s suppose that your “million dollar race car” is really your DB server and your “tires” are your hard drives. Do you know the right configuration to use to get the best performance out of them? Sure, there’s RAID 1, RAID 10, and RAID 5…but do you know which combination of partition offset, RAID stripe size, and allocation unit size to use?
