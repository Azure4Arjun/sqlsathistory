## Title: Database Administration Strategies
## Abstract:
### It's 3 AM and your pager beeps. Oh no!! The slowness is hitting me again!!
There are so many things that we can do to minimise the possibility of a problem and make your lives easier as a DBA, mainly when we are oncall :)
Organize the house, and making our bed everyday will assure that the DBA can relax and focus in other kind of work.
On this session, we will talk about few basic strategies to avoid common problems that DBAs experience in their environments, such as choose the right storage layout, accomodate the database's files properly and configure the TempDB.
