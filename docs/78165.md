## Title: Concurrency in SQL Server - Managing More Than 1 User
## Abstract:
### Have you ever worked on a database used by more than one person?  ;-)  If so, then this session is for you!  In this session we'll talk about what happens when multiple processes compete for the same resources  (aka "Concurrency").  We'll break down SQL Server's isolation levels, and the trade-offs between concurrency and such scary-sounding things as "dirty",  "phantom" reads. There will be practical demo's and some real-life examples "from the trenches".   There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this topic, you may be surprised!
