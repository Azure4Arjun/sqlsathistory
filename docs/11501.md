## Title: SQL Server Batch Mode and CPU Architectures
## Abstract:
### This has a simple demonstration using two columns stores created on the same data, but with the larger one out performing the smaller one when used in the same query, this 'Hook' leads onto a deep dive into how modern CPU architectures are designed how they work and how batch mode leverages these, culminating in where the batch mode CPU pressure point is.
