## Title: Beyond instance tuning: Optimizing and managing a SQL Server Farm
## Abstract:
### Most DBAâ€™s are cowboys, but there is much to learn from the world of cow herding and dairy farms that can make us manage SQL Server instances in a better way. SQL Server farms are the future of large scale database management, and we will teach you the ropes. Introducing the FarmDataLanguage brings another dimension of control to large scale database server monitoring and management.
