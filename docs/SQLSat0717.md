Event Date: 28-04-2018 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Andrew Loree
## Title: Microsoft Machine Learning Services
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services is more than just R and Python language support for SQL Server.  SQL Machine Learning Services provides analytics for any size of data, runs in SQL Server, or alongside Windows, Linux, HDInsight Spark or Hadoop clusters, is simple to administer and allows you to integrate and deploy simply.  In this session, learn architecture and deployment options, stand-alone and in-database, along with some real-world use-cases.  Learn how to leverage Machine Learning Services with new TSQL language support, training and deploying models, scaling beyond memory with RevoScaleR to generating millisecond predictions in-database.  With any size data environment, SQL Machine Learning Services can provide analytics in both an operationally sound and easy to administer paradigm.

A beginner level understanding of Machine Learning and process is highly recommended but not required.  Beyond SQL Machine Learning Services, an overview of all Microsoft Machine Learning

# Eliminating the CRUD with Entity Framework Core
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#717---Wheeling-2018)
Event Date: 28-04-2018 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jeremy Sinclair
## Title: Eliminating the CRUD with Entity Framework Core
## Abstract:
### Developers need to insert and query data stored in databases, but never want to enter the land of building SQL stored procedures for everything. I want to give an approach to CRUD without caring about the underlying database container. We're .NET Developers, we like to write structures in a way that makes sense to us. In this case, Entity Framework Core is a brilliant option that layers on top of MySQL, Postgres SQL, and MS SQL, to name a few.

## Speaker: Devon Leann Ramirez
## Title: Handcrafting Covering Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you have a need for speed but cannot change the code? Covering indexes might be your best friend. You might have heard about covering indexes, but what are they exactly and how do you design one? In this session, we explore what covering indexes are, why you might or might not need one, how to craft them, and how to test them for effectiveness. By the end of the session, you will be prepared to make effective indexing decisions while tuning individual queries.

## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction
## Abstract:
### It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

# Working Effectively With Legacy SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#717---Wheeling-2018)
Event Date: 28-04-2018 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Working Effectively With Legacy SQL
## Abstract:
### A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.

# Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
## Abstract:
### ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and concurrency you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

# 45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#717---Wheeling-2018)

## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: 45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.
