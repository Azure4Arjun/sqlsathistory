## Title: SSIS Moving Beyond the Script Task  Script Compon
## Abstract:
### Move beyond the script task and script component and youâ€™ll find one of the often overlooked aspects of Integration Services is the extensibility options that are available. We will dive into a world of .Net code and discover your options for extending your SSIS Packages with custom objects. We will explore both custom task and data flow components as we develop from the ground up a set of reusable SSIS components using managed code.
