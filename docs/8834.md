## Title: Migrating SQL Server applications to run on MPP systems (PDW, Netezza, etc.)
## Abstract:
### Find out what makes Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) systems different from traditional Relational Database Management System (RDMS) environments and how to prepare your application to run on them.  You'll learn about the key players in the MPP DB space, what you gain in such a transformation, what you lose, what stumbling blocks to watch out for, and how to get the most from the end result.
