## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
## Abstract:
### How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: 10 Things all BI System Administrators Should Know
## Abstract:
### Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator? Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.

## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Abstract:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

# Parallelism in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#92---Oregon-2011)
Event Date: 08-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 
## Speaker: Victor Isakov
## Title: Parallelism in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 R2 supports up to 256 logical processors! Intel has released CPUs that support 10 cores and hyper-threading. So a quad-socket commodity server can easily support 80 logical processors. It's time for DBAs and Developers to understand how parallelism works in SQL Server! There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about how parallelism works in SQL Server and, more importantly, how to troubleshoot and solve parallelism problems. CXPACKET waits are not necessarily bad! In this session, Victor Isakov (MCT, MCM, MCA) will cover how parallelism works before presenting how to detect, troubleshoot and solve parallelism problems.
