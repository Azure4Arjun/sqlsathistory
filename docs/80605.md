## Speaker: Ryan Casey
## Title: "Real World" examples on loading a data warehouse using SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this demo-heavy session we will discuss the value of a SSIS Framework, explore forward engineering benefits, and demonstrate SSIS design patterns on loading SQL structures when developing Data Warehouses, SSAS Cubes, and Power BI Analytics.

An outline of the subject matter to be covered is below:

Live Demo SSIS Framework
  ● Load  Error Meta Data
  ● Restart ability, Rollback, Reload Count
  ● Master Load ID, LoadID, ExecutionID (SSISDB), Refresh
  ● Package Sequencing and Signatures
  ● Connections, Expressions, Parameters, Event Handlers
  ● Alerting (SMTP), Error Flows (XML Destination Script)

Forward Engineering SQL Structures (Examples from Most Popular Modeling Tools)
  ● Relationships, Primary  Foreign Keys
  ● Data Types, Nullability, Indexes

Fully Functional Demos for Multiple Design Patterns
  ● Dimensions
  ● Slowly Changing
  ● Facts
  ● Inserts, Updates, Deletes
  ● Bridges / Snowflakes
