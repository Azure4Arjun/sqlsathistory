## Title: Managing MSDB
## Abstract:
### You put a lot of time into managing your databases, but MSDB often flies under the radar or only gets backed up. There are a ton of things that get stored in MSDB, so how are you supposed to know what all those items are? More importantly, how do you manage the data that is getting stored in there and keep it from growing out of control? We will take an in-depth look at all the SQL features that put data in MSDB and the best approach to managing that data.  You will walk away with scripts you can use to automate the grooming of MSDB.
