## Title: Introduction to Azure Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is fully managed service to create, test, operationalize and manage predictive analytics solutions in the cloud. With just a browser, you can now sign up to Azure Machine Learning, upload data and immediately start machine learning experiments. Visual composition, large pallet of modules and a library of starting templates makes common machine learning tasks simple and quick. Turning a model into web service is easy - with a few clicks, a Predictive model build in ML Studio can be turned into a public REST API that encapsulates custom data transformation logic and sophisticated machine learning models. Presentation will cover key features for solving real world tasks.
