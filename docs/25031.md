## Title: Let's cook  'best SQL Server DBA practices'
## Abstract:
### In this session we will go through the topics of performance, scalability and availbility - the 3 core topics that every DBA needs to know. Performance is at the core and required for every database application (small or mission-critical). In this talk we will go through the concepts, tools and procedures that will help you in monitoring and start fine-tuning the performance or find the root-cause on your data platform. The subject covered here is excerpted from my book "Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Administration cookbook". This will also be an ideal beginning for any IT person who is willing step-into DBA world.
