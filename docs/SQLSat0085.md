# Data Sharding in OLTP Systems
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#85-Orlando-2011)
Event Date: 24-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 1
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Data Sharding in OLTP Systems
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest challenges for modern OLTP Systems is the amount of data needed to be collected and processed. Business requirements, industry standards and regulations require systems to retain enormous amount of information. Offline data archiving is not often an option especially with the hosted solutions - customers expect old data to be available on the fly. Keeping all data in the single instance of SQL Server is the most expensive option from hardware cost and management standpoints. 

This session demonstrates several data sharding techniques that can be used to partition the data across multiple database servers focusing on the task of separating production and historical data in OLTP systems

# The Fundamentals of DBA-ism 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#85-Orlando-2011)
Event Date: 24-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 1
## Speaker: Don Stevic
## Title: The Fundamentals of DBA-ism 
## Abstract:
### When I was a freshly minted DBA and trying to learn the ropes, my manager used to tell me “You should know that, that’s DBA 101”. As much as it frustrated me, he was right. There is a core set of knowledge that DBA. Correct SQL installation and configuration, how’s and whys of backups, how to make your role proactive, and many other things fall under that heading. This session is for the “freshly minted” DBA to help them find and define their own set of best practices.

# You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#85-Orlando-2011)
Event Date: 24-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Performance
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query.  If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

## Speaker: Eric Wisdahl
## Title: SSIS Data Flow Buffer Breakdown
## Abstract:
### This session will examine the different types of data flow components, execution trees, data buffers, performance metrics and logging mechanisms. In determining how the buffers are built and used, the developer will begin to understand if, how and why package performance will be impacted when new transformations or columns are added. The developer will further learn how to capture performance metrics to identifiably track these impacts. Finally, the session will take a look at the controls and effects of parallel package and parallel task execution.

# TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#85-Orlando-2011)
Event Date: 24-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Performance
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
## Abstract:
### Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.

## Speaker: James McAuliffe
## Title: SSIShare The Code Man
## Abstract:
### For many SSIS scenarios, a desired outcome is to implement logic or rules that are used in existing enterprise applications, only to do so in an a bulk data loading scenario.  Many times the logic being applied is complex and multi-step.  We will examine various scenarios where complex logic from shared code sources can be applied in SSIS processing scenarios.    
1 How to use code from shared enterprise sources

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Working With XML In SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

## Title: Rapidly Deploying SQL Server with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### As much as you love SQL Server, do you cringe anytime you hear that you’ll need to stand up yet another SQL Server instance? Sure it’s fun, but who has the time? Maybe you’ve thought there must be a better way of doing this?  Sure, you have the ability to generate an unattended install file, but what about all the other things that will need to be done?  In this talk, we will explore a process that was created to truly automate not just the SQL Server install, but all of the configurations and the deployment of your organizations standard objects, all using a set of PowerShell scripts that you can download and use today.

# PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans

## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
## Abstract:
### The paradox of Business Intelligence: it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor. Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us. Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow? In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications). The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :) I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them. (But they deserved it!) Learn how to: create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Becoming DAX: An Introduction ... 
## Abstract:
### The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language is a library of operators and constants that we can combine to craft formulas and expressions in PowerPivot Client. In this introductory session Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson will concentrate upon crafting simple DAX expressions whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. He’ll overview a simple data source structure, outline the components of simple DAX syntax, and get you started understanding basic expressions.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
