## Title: Performance Tuning Queries
## Abstract:
### We all hear that infamous statement “My query is running slow”.  In this session we’ll review queries to show you what can be done to correct poorly running queries.  We’ll review the execution plans and what you should look for.  We’ll discuss Set based logic vs procedural based logic.  We’ll discuss Functions and their effect on performance.
