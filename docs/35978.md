## Title: Lights, Camera, Action: Introduction to Creating and Delivering Presentations
## Abstract:
### Sharing your technical knowledge can be a gift for both you and others.  But how would you share your knowledge through a presentation?  There are so many things to consider: what topic to discuss, where should you present, and should you really imagine the audience naked.  This presentation covers these topics, along with much more.  Before long, you too can share the gift of presenting!
