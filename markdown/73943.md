## Title: SSIS Incremental Loading:  The Tortoise and The Hare
## Abstract:
### Extracting, transforming and loading data has become a major component to satisfying business requirements and needs.  Depending on the size of the data you are working with, the way you design your SSIS packages can have an impact on performance and run times.  

In this session, we will cover a variety of incremental design approaches centered around large data sets using SSIS.  We will look at the architecture of each ETL strategy to determine the pros and cons and generate specific use cases to decide which strategy yields optimal results.
