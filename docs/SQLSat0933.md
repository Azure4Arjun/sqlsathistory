# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#933---Nashville-2020)
Event Date: 18-01-2020 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Database   Application Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

You recognize the benefits of storing your SQL Server workloads in the cloud and ready for things to happen. Everyone agrees its the right answer, however, there is one problem. Your organization need to understand the expected costs before moving forward. Understanding the cost to move to Azure and its run rate are questions several companies struggle with and has led to several choosing to stay in their current state. It is not because the cost is too high as some may expect, but oftentimes because simply no one has any idea what to expect. 

In this session, I will walk you through steps that show you how to estimate the cost of your move to Azure and provide several unique considerations along the way that can have an impact on this. Next time someone asks how much, you will be ready!

## Title: How To Be The DBA When You Don't Have A DBA
## Abstract:
### Not everyone has a full time Database Administrator on staff, and in many cases the responsibility of managing the database server falls on the developers.  But as long as the backups are running successfully you're good, right?  Not exactly.  There is ongoing maintenance required to help ensure that your databases are running smoothly.  Are your statistics out of date?  Are your indexes fragmented?  When was the last time the databases were checked for corruption? Has your SQL Server been tuned to fit your workload, or are you still running with the less optimal default settings?

Tailored to the "Non-DBA", this session will cover these topics and more to ensure that you can avoid some performance issues you may not even realize you're having.  Discussing server settings, database configurations, and recommended maintenance, you will leave this session with the knowledge (and scripts!) you need to help ensure that your SQL Server and databases are in top shape.

## Abstract:
### You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better and how Redgate’s tools can make your journey to DevOps easier.

# CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming

Event Date: 18-01-2020 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: BI Architecture  Management
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Turn Runbooks into Notebooks: Handling Maintenance and Emergencies with Azure Data Studio
## Abstract:
### On-call DBAs have all had that phone call in the middle of the night: "the database is down, fix it now!" We start scrambling to piece together various scripts to analyze the emergency, mitigate the issues, and kick off a failover or similar fix to make the database happy and healthy once again. Even scheduled maintenance likely requires us to download scripts from a ticket, run the scripts, and screenshot the results for documentation. What if I told you that Azure Data Studio's notebooks allow you to execute T-SQL and PowerShell together to handle these processes from a single document that documents its own results and can be stored directly in source control? Join me in this demo-heavy session to see how we can handle real-world on-call situations using Azure Data Studio notebooks.

## Speaker: Amy Herold
## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.
