## Title: Extending Power BI via the REST API and Power BI Embedded
## Abstract:
### Nowadays Power BI can be called via an API. The API provides the capability of delivering real-time dashboarding scenarios via REST or an easy way to  integrate Power BI reports in your application via Power BI embedded.
During this session I will show the possibilities of the API and how it can be integrated with Azure services, like Stream Analytics and AzureML, or embedded into a custom .NET application with Power BI Embedded to provide either a real-time dashboard for Business and/or IoT scenarios or custom solutions with integrated Power BI dashboards.
