## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: (Way Too Much) Fun with Reporting Services 
## Abstract:
### Head starting to explode from all the technical information you’re absorbing?  Come spend a session with us while we play games with Reporting Services…literally!  Come watch and cheer as SQL Server MVP Stacia Misner and a handpicked volunteer engage in word play, all wrapped up in SQL Server Reporting Services.  They’ll push the limits with what can be built in SSRS and have a stupid amount of fun while doing it.  Trash talk, board games and SQL…who could ask for more?
