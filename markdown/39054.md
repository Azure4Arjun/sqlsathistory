## Speaker: Ben Thul
## Title: Running with Scissors - SQLCLR and You
## Abstract:
### Have you ever tried to do something in the database that T-SQL just didn't seem quite up to the task? Or perhaps you've been a little jealous of the application developers and their fancy Visual Studio and whatnot. Whatever your reason for wanting to learn about the CLR, you've come to the right place! In this session you'll learn how to extend the capabilities of your database with CLR stored procedures, functions, aggregates, and data types.
