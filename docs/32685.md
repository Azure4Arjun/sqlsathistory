## Title: Architecting no downtime databases.
## Abstract:
### Do you have a highly visible online application where you cannot sustain a database outage?  How do you handle the planned outages needed for basic maintenance such as patching?  In this session I will share some methods utilizing SQL Server features to provide 100% up-time.  We will also discuss issues with using clusters as part of an uptime strategy.  Finally we will spend some time discussing how Denali can help improve this up-time by utilizing “Always On” features.
