## Title: Ways SQL Server Lies and the Performance Tuning Headaches It Can Cause.
## Abstract:
### Have you ever tried to tune a query  or searched for a  performance bottleneck just to have SQL Server lead you down a rabbit hole?   In this session we will look at some common performance issues that can occur that might be masked or hidden by misleading information  you get from SQL Server.    We will also talk about why SQL Server gives you the information it does,  and how to see past this information and find the real issues causing your performance problems.
