## Title: If You Build It, They Will Come--Creating Your Own Opportunities!
## Abstract:
### Often times we might feel like we are simply spinning our wheels and can't seem to move ahead.  Perhaps we see others getting opportunities and can't quite place why more doesn't come our way.  This session will discuss how we can put ourselves in the drivers seat when it comes to making opportunities so we can make some decisions about what we want to do rather than choosing from what is left.
