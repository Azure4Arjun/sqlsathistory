## Title: SSIS:  Handling flat file changes using BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### You develop an SSIS package to load a flat file.  You meticulously identify each of the columns and map the columns to the target table.  Your package runs fine for months.  Then the file format changes.  It is back to the drawing board, selecting each column, setting the data types (type, length, etc.).  In many cases, you actually have the file structure in an electronic form.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply regenerate your SSIS package using that metadata?

In this session I will demonstrate how to automate the generation of SSIS packages using the open source BIML and BIMLScript.  I will generate a set of packages to load all of the tables from one database into a new database using the results of an Information Schema view.

I will then demonstrate how to use this technique to handle changes in file structure.  Using a simple Excel workbook I will represent the structure of a flat file and its relationship to a staging table.  From this metadata, I will generate an SSIS package tha
