## Title: Building an SSIS Management Framework - Part 1
## Abstract:
### As more and more organizations and teams within organizations have started adopting SQL Server Integration Services for data processing and other management task automation, there is increasing need for standardization early in the process to avoid common management problems that arise from lack of standardization and good management techniques. In this session, we will help you identify areas of standardization and pitfalls that arise from lack of standards, reviews some common standardization approaches and best practices and finally walk you through a standardized template example that can be customized, deployed and used as a starting point for an SSIS project.
