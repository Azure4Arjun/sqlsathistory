## Title: Take Your Automation Scripts to the Next Level!
## Abstract:
### DBA’s traditionally have a library of T-SQL scripts which they use in automating their job.  PowerShell, Microsoft’s newest scripting language, can take those T-SQL scripts to the next level.  PowerShell and the SMO (Server Management Objects) library allow a DBA to create scripts that will interact with the OS and SQL Server at the same time. In this session we reveal the power of automating SQL Server with PowerShell by reviewing a number of scripts that have been migrated from T-SQL to PowerShell.  This session will include scripts that will backup databases, interrogate a server, and script out objects from a database.
