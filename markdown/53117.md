## Title: Biml: I got the basics - what's next?
## Abstract:
### So you have made first contact with Biml and are excited? Good!

You're wondering, if Biml can do more than just transfer data from SQL table to another? Great!

Because Biml does so much more than just simple SSIS packages. We'll explore the potential on how to improve your existing packages using BimlScript and LINQ.
Topics covered, amongst others, are derived columns, incremental changes and how to handle flat files. 

You'll leave with sample code and hopefully a couple of ideas on how to bring your Biml development to the next level.
