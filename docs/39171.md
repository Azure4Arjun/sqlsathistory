This full-day seminar will show you how to optimize SQL Server queries and create high-performance applications. You will learn about the inner workings of the query processor so you can write better queries and provide the query processor with the quality information it needs to produce efficient execution plans. Youâ€™ll also get tips for troubleshooting under-performing queries. In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton), a key new feature of SQL Server 2014, will be covered as well. Topics include:

How the query optimizer works
Troubleshoot queries using extended events, SQL trace, dynamic management views (DMVs), the data collector, and other tools
Work with query operators for data access, joins, aggregations, parallelism, and updates
Speed up queries and dramatically improve application performance by creating the right indexes
Understand statistics and how to detect and fix cardinal
