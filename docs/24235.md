## Speaker: Scott Nei
## Title: A Better Introduction to Tabular Mode in SSAS
## Abstract:
### Using live demos, this session will demonstrate Tabular mode in SSAS.  With an emphasis on understanding why it works and behaves the way it does, you'll have the foundational knowledge to learn how to develop effectively in this new mode.

If you've been left confused by filter context, nested DAX measures, or the CALCULATE() function, come and get a better introduction.  It's OK to start is a beginner, I just don't want you stuck there.
