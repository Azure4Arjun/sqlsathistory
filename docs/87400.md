## Title: Using distributed AGs for your migrations
## Abstract:
### You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will discuss what distributed AGs are, show how to set them up, and show how to monitor distributed AGs.
