## Title: Tuning SQL Server Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### If you worked with transactional replication at some point in your career, then you had to answer the dreaded question why is the data so old in the subscriber? Unable to find the culprit, you just re-synch the data, hate replication, and move on. Wonder what you could do differently? In this session, you will learn the moving parts, the bottlenecks, the tuning knobs, and perhaps to love replication.
