## Title: Learn On-premises BI: SSRS 2016 and Power BI
## Abstract:
### Both Power BI and SSRS will help you deliver compelling BI solutions, whether IT managed and/or self-service. For many companies it is important to deliver such solution as on-premises option.

In this session I will give you a tour of enhancements in SSRS 2016 including KPI, mobile  paginated reports. Mobile reports can now be viewed on any device; tablet, smartphone and desktop. 

I will also show you the newly introduced Power BI Report Server, that allows you to deploy Power BI Reports on-premises.
