## Title: Transactional Replication-10 steps for successful implementation
## Abstract:
### What is potentially our biggest problem with transactional replication? You guessed it...it breaks! It may break for a variety of reasons and we as DBAâ€™s probably have experienced them all at one point or another. Our biggest worry? Bringing replication back online whenever a full snapshot reinitialization is not an option due to time or space concerns. But don't you worry; we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves! During this session, we will go over options available to you to re-sync your replication with minimal downtime for your production environments.
