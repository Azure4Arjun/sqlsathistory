## Title: New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the new features introduced with SQL Server 2016 to enhance security. 
Always Encrypted is a new technology that protects your data not only at rest, but also throughout the whole interaction between the application and the database.
Dynamic Data Masking is another interesting feature that allows us to protect sensitive data by masking it to all users that don’t have enough privileges to see the actual contents.
Row Level Security allows showing to end users only the data they’re entitled to access, without changing the applications’ code.
We will demonstrate the use of these three features with example applications and we will explore the use cases where these technologies represent a big leap from previous custom implementations.
