## Title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to navigating Power BI
## Abstract:
### Are you also sometimes lost in space? What is up and what is down, when it comes to navigation in Power BI. How much is controlled and what can you adjust yourself?

This session will cover all the options we have to change and setup navigation on three different levels. (1) Inside Reports, (2) between Reports in an App and finally (3) the Power BI Web Portal to help users finding the Apps and Reports. You will be amazed how much actually can be done, to give your users a better experience.

We will cover topics like, Power BI Service navigation, Linking from an Intranet, Setting up Dashboards, The new App navigation, Drillthrough, Buttons, Bookmarks and much more.
