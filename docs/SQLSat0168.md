### Implement an SSIS Framework to track the progress of  SSIS production packages similar to how you can in the BIDS Designer, and explore your package withs  windows explorer like capability.Utilizing  the “out of the box” SSIS Logging with no changes required to the existing  logic or packages. The new framework  will also use SSIS to scan existing packages and automatically discover Master / Child package relationships and providing a capability for package restartability. This design pattern can be use to replace earlier “Stored Proc” version of SSIS Framework greatly reducing the code required. This functionality is complementary to the 2012 Package Tracking capability.

# Hello, My Name Is DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-168)
Event Date: 17-11-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 4. Misc
## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Hello, My Name Is DAX
## Abstract:
### For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without development access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.  We will even show how to use DAX expressions to create new measures.
