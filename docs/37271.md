## Title: Building a Big Data Solution
## Abstract:
### As a follow-on to the presentation “Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture”, this vendor-free presentation will explain exactly what Big Data is and its benefits, including use cases.  We will discuss how Hadoop, the cloud and massively parallel processing (MPP) is changing the way data warehouses are being built.  We will talk about hybrid architectures that combine on-premise data with data in the cloud as well as relational data and non-relational (unstructured) data.  We will look at the benefits of MPP over SMP and how to integrate data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  You will learn what a modern data warehouse should look like and how the role of a Data Lake and Hadoop fit in.  The Big Data boom brings new challenges to those of you who define the architectures to create and consume business-critical data.  You will need guidance on the best solution for your data warehouse going forward.  This presentation will help to give you that guidance!
