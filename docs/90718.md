## Title: The Fast and Easy Methods to Automate your SQL Server builds
## Abstract:
### Are you still clicking around the SQL Server GUI installation?  Have you seen the many new features that are different from version to version?  Wouldn't it be nice to standardize your SQL installations so that on every new release there wasn't much to change, but were still able to take advantage of new features?  Attend this session and we'll walk through some of the installation scripts that I have tested and built from SQL 2008 to SQL 2017. 
 
After this session, you'll learn the benefits you can do from a command line install, quickly provision SQL Servers and prepare for future releases without too much maintenance.  You'll also learn how to take advantage of updates and new features by adding a few options into your script.
