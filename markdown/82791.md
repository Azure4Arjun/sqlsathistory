## Title: Finding root cause for unexplained Availability Group failover
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will walk you step by step showing how we determine root cause analysis of an unexplained failure in an Availability Group.  Whether the databases simply became unavailable, synchronization stopped, or there was an unexplained failover.   We will show you specifically what we look for in the OS Cluster logs, SQL error logs, Extended Events and other sources of information.
