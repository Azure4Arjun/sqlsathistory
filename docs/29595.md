## Title: High Volume Real Time Contiguous ETL and Audit
## Abstract:
### High volume contiguous ETL is always problematic, and even more so when near-real-time is desired. This presentation goes through a solution collects and aggregates security audit data for nearly 400000 machines, a contiguous 24x7 stream of nearly 200 events per second, using a budget tight solution that involves SQL Express, Service Broker and Database Mirroring.
