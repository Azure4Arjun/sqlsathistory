## Speaker: Sonja Madsen
## Title: Branding SharePoint and Office 365
## Abstract:
### Drive user adoption and get more business value of your investment by branding and customizing smarter and not harder. While for end-users, SharePoint still looks pretty much the same, branding SharePoint on Office 365, the cloud technology, and continuous Microsoft updates require a different approach to branding.
I'll talk about what it takes to apply consistent corporate branding on Office 365, and how to keep up with Office 365 updates that roll out new features and changes in design and navigation.
