## Title: SSIS + SharePoint = Interoperability
## Abstract:
### Interacting with SharePoint has been a challenge due to the fact that getting data into and out of SharePoint is still not very straight-forward. There are a few different ways to extract or load SharePoint data including SharePoint APIs, Web Services, and Client Object Model. What is the best way to get data out of or into a SharePoint list?

This session will demonstrate the techniques to simplify access to the SharePoint Lists and to get data into and out of SharePoint lists easily by using SSIS. You will learn how to combine Web Services, CAML and ETL tools to create a high performance data integration solution.
