## Speaker: Owen Auger
## Title: DAX for Business Analytics - My Favourite Examples
## Abstract:
### The DAX language, at the core of Power BI, puts advanced analytical techniques in the hands of a wide range of business users.

In this session I will share a smorgasbord of my favourite analytical techniques using the DAX language that I have developed and encountered in a business environment.
Examples include scenario  variance analysis, advanced date and time-based calculations, "Top N  Other", detecting runs of outcomes, inverting filters, and finding your greatest ally or nemesis.

This session is for anyone who loves problem-solving with Power BI in a business environment, whether you are already using DAX or keen to learn.
