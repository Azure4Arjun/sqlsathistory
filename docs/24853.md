## Speaker: David Moutray
## Title: Developers vs. DBA's:  Cats  Dogs
## Abstract:
### Application Developers focus on delivering working code, while DBA's focus on Data Quality.  Since developers vastly outnumber us, we must - somehow - persuade them that our objectives are important, too.  This, in turn, requires that we understand the source of the conflict and learn to see the world from multiple points of view.
