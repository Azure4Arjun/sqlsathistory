## Speaker: Joe Chang
## Title: Modern Performance
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that hardware today is immensely powerful in all aspects- CPU, memory and even IOPS (with proper configuration). It is less appreciated that in recent versions the SQL Server query optimizer can quickly find a good executions plan from a staggering number of possibilities. And yet it is also generally understood that performance is still an important topic today. This apparent paradox stems from the fact that when mistakes happen in software â€“ especially for database query optimization, it can happen in spectacular fashion. Several examples of SQL that can experience catastrophic performance problems are presented, along with the method of diagnosis and corrective action.
