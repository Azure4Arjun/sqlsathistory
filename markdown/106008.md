## Abstract:
### In this session we will discuss about tempdb contention in SQL Server on-premises, Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database. We will analyze both, Allocation Contention and Metadata contention, describing in detail WHEN and HOW it occurs, How to diagnose it, Best Practices and how to prevent it. The session will have both approaches in on-premisses and in Azure Managed Instance: - Theoretical, to understand what and why it occurs. - Practical, with examples causing it, offering alternatives to solve it and to prevent it.
