## Title: Physical Join Operators
## Abstract:
### SQL Server implements three different physical operators to perform joins. In this session we will examine how each of these operators work, its advantages and challenges. We will try to understand the logic behind the optimizer's decisions on which operator to use for various joins using (semi) real life examples and we will see how to avoid common join related pitfalls.
