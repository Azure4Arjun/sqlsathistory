## Title: It's Not Your Fault, It's the SQL Server Default
## Abstract:
### When you see those little green checkmarks, then you know your new SQL Server instance is ready to go, right? Not exactly. Your fresh installation has some questionable default settings that could cause headaches and heartburn in the future. In this session, we identify several instance and database defaults that could lead to disaster, and discuss how you can modify them to improve performance and avoid unnecessary problems.
