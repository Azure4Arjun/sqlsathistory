## Title: Database "Insecurity"
## Abstract:
### We all know that database security is important.  Data is the lifeblood of modern business.  Moreover, Microsoft has given us tremendous tools for securing our databases at the database level.  Yet, how many database developers and database administrators use them?  How many understand them?  Database security is woefully neglected.  There are relatively few articles published on database security.  There are no new books on database security.  Compare this with the tremendous number of books, articles and conferences on Network Security.  Yet, our databases are vulnerable.  This is a call to action.
