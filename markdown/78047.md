## Title: AWS Aurora from a SQL Server DBA's perspective
## Abstract:
### AWS Aurora sounds perfect - a magical in-the-cloud relational database where everything Just Works.  And while that's true to an extent, it's still MySQL behind the scenes, and there's some things to keep in mind.  Join us as we discuss the advantages, disadvantages, promises,  realities.  We'll also look at ways to monitor performance, track code changes, and investigate what's going on behind the scenes.  There will be demos, SQL code, Powershell and more.
