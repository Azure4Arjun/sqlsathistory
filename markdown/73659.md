## Title: Monitoring with sp_WhoIsActive, PowerShell and PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows sp_WhoIsActive by Adam Machanic! In this session, we will see how its output captured periodically to a central database using PowerShell can be used as an effective monitoring tool with the analytics provided by Power BI. sp_WhoIsActive puts out the best output. PowerShell is the best at collecting data centrally from multiple servers and Power BI is the best at presenting and analyzing the results. The session will bring together features of sp_WhoIsActive, PowerShell and PowerBI to get an effective solution.
