## Title: Table Diaspora - A Tale from the Trenches
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to migrate a table from one database to another with zero downtime? Or perhaps needed to do an operation that would normally require an aggressive/long-duration lock? What if you needed to do the same thing to dozens of tablesâ€½

You'll never believe it - this happened to me! In this session, I'll outline how I did it. You'll learn about triggers, computed columns, module signing, SSIS, and just enough BIML to be dangerous.
