## Title: Wibbly-Wobbly, Timey-Wimey Tables
## Abstract:
### The temporal table type is introduced with SQL 2016. It has practical applications as a background auditing replacement and even dimensional tables in DataMart. This session will look at creating temporal tables, modifying data, and querying enhancements. The temporal table type allows time travelling in widowed views without the need to write complicated joins to multiple historic/audit tables.
