## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: SQL 2016 Upgrade as a Project
## Abstract:
### As DBAs we are often stuck at the mercy of higher ups and Project Managers for completion of our assigned tasks/ projects.
In this session we wil actually take an arbitrary application and its affiliated databases and go throught the tasks/resources needed to accomplish the task. We will think and act like a Project Manager and DBA rolled into one. This will surely help you advance your career within organization and help you think ahead of time. We will use the PMI's approach to a project. We will examine ways to break down the large project into smaller Agile segments. We will look at various documents/forms/reports/steps and phases. 

This presentation will lay out this rather complex project into a simple laid out plan.
