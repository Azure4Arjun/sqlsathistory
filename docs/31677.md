## Title: Dynamically Configuring SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### In this session, you’ll learn how to control your SSIS packages in a more powerful way by using expressions. The expression language is a bit of an elusive language that can be used to make any component in SSIS dynamic. Then, you’ll learn how to use configuration files to externalize the configuration of your package and lastly how to pass variables into a package. Also learn how to use parent child packages and environment variables.
