## Title: SQL Server PDW 2012
## Abstract:
### Although many have still not heard much about Microsoft's Parallel Data Warehouse Appliance the 2012 release of the product is our 7th version to market.  I will cover the basic differences between SMP and MPP data warehouse systems, how the Microsoft PDW works, and what features and sizes are available in PDW 2012.   We'll also talk about how PDW 2012 allows you to integrate your typical relational data with your Big Data in one integrated environment.
