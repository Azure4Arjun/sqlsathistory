## Title: Agile Analytics: How to do it using the Microsoft BI toolset
## Abstract:
### You can build a high-quality, high-velocity, and high-efficiency BI team using Microsoft development tools, including Visual Studio Online (or Team Foundation Server), SQL Server Data Tools, SQL Server Data Tools - Business Intelligence, and Power BI. This presentation is an overview of the toolset, as well as some recommended additional tools (mostly open source), and some of the high-level disciplines and practices that can turn a chaotic, bug-ridden mess into a finely-tuned, value-producing team. We'll talk about work item management, source code control, testing techniques, and automated builds and deployment mechanisms.
