## Title: Rapid Prototyping with Google Spreadsheets and using your DBA budget for bacon
## Abstract:
### I'll go through the problem (needing a quick and easy way to get a database set up to start developing), the solution (Google Spreadsheets and how to get setup for development) and then I'll show a couple examples of the projects I've developed with it. I'll also make good on my promise of using your DBA budget allocation for bacon.
