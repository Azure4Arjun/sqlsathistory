## Title: Introduction to PowerShell
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is Microsoft's next-generation command-line shell and scripting language. In this session we will discuss why you need it, how to use it, and what makes it different from any other shell on any platform. For administrators, Microsoft is investing heavily in PowerShell as the hub for its Windows Server products, starting with Exchange 2007 and SQL Server 2008. For developers, PowerShell provides full access to .NET for Read-Eval-Print loops (REPL), rapid prototyping, object exploration and extensibility. We will take a quick look at features for both groups before diving into an interactive demo, so come prepared with questions you have or problems we can solve together.
