## Title: Everything I Needed to Know About Dashboarding I Learned From World of Warcraft
## Abstract:
### The LSU Foundation embarked on its first $1B+ campaign in the university's history. To prepare, the organization saw the need to instill discipline, overhaul its systems, and develop a progressive business intelligence shop from the ground up. In this session you will hear from a world ranked World of Warcraft player on how her experience competing with one of the top guilds in the world provided deep insights that allowed her to build compelling, user friendly dashboards while instilling a culture that embraced transparency and accountability. This is a deep dive into the process that got them there, and the lessons they learned along the way. You will leave this session with concrete, actionable tasks and tools to begin building better dashboards, and a performance driven culture of your own.
