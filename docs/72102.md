## Title: What is the SQL Datawarehouse?
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a massively parallel processing (MPP) cloud-based, scale-out, relational database capable of processing massive volumes of data.
SQL Data Warehouse:
Combines the SQL Server relational database with Azure cloud scale-out capabilities.
Decouples storage from compute.
Enables increasing, decreasing, pausing, or resuming compute.
Integrates across the Azure platform.
Utilizes SQL Server Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and tools.
In this session we will discuss about this awesome feature from Microsoft Azure and how we can use it to help on our day to day.
