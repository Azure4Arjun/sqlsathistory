# Dimensional Data Model Prototyping With PowerPivot
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#149-Minnesota-2012)
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Keller 3-115
## Speaker: Eric Ness
## Title: Dimensional Data Model Prototyping With PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### Data modeling is often an abstract exercise involving a lot of talk and diagrams, but little hands-on experimentation.  This may still be viable in the world of transactional systems where a lack of source data prevents the modeler from quickly creating a prototype system, however in the world of dimensional modeling where source data is abundant there’s no longer a reason to treat data modeling as an academic exercise.  This session will cover how to use PowerPivot for Excel to quickly create prototypes of different dimensional models to try out and discard as necessary.  The features of PowerPivot which allow quick import of data from a variety of data sources will also be demonstrated.

## Title: SSRS: Reporting on Reports
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence gets a lot of press these days, but do you often wonder to yourself as you are writing a report, ‘Who is going to use this’? Learn about the rich information that SSRS is already capturing for you about your reports: who is running them and how often, how long do they take to execute, how much time is spent in data retrieval vs rendering, which parameters were passed in, and more…

# GeoGRAPHY and GeoMETRY Spatial Data Types
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#149-Minnesota-2012)
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Keller 2-260
## Speaker: Ross McNeely
## Title: GeoGRAPHY and GeoMETRY Spatial Data Types
## Abstract:
### In this session explore the use of the SQL Server spatial data types.  We will see an example of the geography spatial data type used to represent data in a round-earth coordinate system.  Then the geometry spatial data type which represents data in a flat coordinate system will be demonstrated.  Both spatial types are CLR data types and provide a powerful way for businesses; such as; retailers to identify where their shoppers are concentrated, or for call centers to visualize the effect of top performers on others.

Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Rapson 43
## Speaker: Luke Jian
## Title: Anatomy of a Join
## Abstract:
### A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.

## Title: Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility
## Abstract:
### How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.

# Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#149-Minnesota-2012)
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Keller 3-125
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
## Abstract:
### Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document. In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Speaker: Zach Mattson
## Title: A Powershell Driven Life
## Abstract:
### Why am I here?  This is a question you might ask yourself each day at work.  Perhaps its mundane tasks, reactive troubleshooting, or just filling out TPS reports on a Friday afternoon.  This session is going to attack the mundane and show you some of the things Powershell can bring to the table for working with SQL Server.  From performance monitoring to writing tests, it promises to be entirely scripts and demos compiled from real work on a large OLTP SQL environment .  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.       

No SSIS or Powerpoint will be harmed during this presentation.
