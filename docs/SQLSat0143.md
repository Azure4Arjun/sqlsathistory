## Abstract:
### Power View is the new ad-hoc data visualization tool coming in SQL Server 2012. Power View runs on a Business Intelligence Semantic Model created in either PowerPivot for Excel, or in Visual Studio 2010 for publishing to SQL Server Analysis Services. In this session we will go through the complete process for creating several (BISM) models from scratch, and working up in complexity using the Data Analysis Expresssion Language (DAX) to provide a functional and usable experience for your end-users that will use Power View.

How Flash-Optimized Storage Architectures 
Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage Management
This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures over the past 25 years, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  
We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.    
But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures desig
