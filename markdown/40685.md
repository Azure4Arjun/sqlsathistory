## Title: Building a Better Mousetrap: Using Cisco UCS for SQL Server Deplo
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs still hold onto the notion that each implementation of SQL Server requires a dedicated physical server. In today’s world dominated by virtualization and an ever increasing eye towards all things cloud, the infrastructure under SQL Server has a greater impact than ever before. This session will discuss the key differences between physical, virtual, and cloud; how the platform choice affects SQL Server deployments; and how Cisco’s UCS can benefit not only SQL Server and the DBAs, but also system administrators.
