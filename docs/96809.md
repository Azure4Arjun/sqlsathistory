## Title: Report optimization techniques in both Desktop and Service. Vertipaq Engine in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is using In-memory technology, which allows reports to be loaded and presented fast. But here you are limited by CPU and RAM characteristics. Similar behaviour will be when your report is placed at Power BI Service. 

At current session I will describe possible performance issues and how to handle them. We will talk about columnar storage and Vertipaq engine as well. During the session different practice advices will be presented.
