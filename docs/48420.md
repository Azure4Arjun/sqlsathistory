## Title:   A Choice Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### We don't just throw resources to a server until we can prove it is going to be utilized. I was often asked how to know and when the SQL Server system needs additional hardware resources? or we can trim down the excessive usage of resources?
It is a choice of judgement from experiences. The optimization goal is not to waste system resources but maintain database best performance. In this session, let me share with you my many years of experiences and show you the general rule of thumb to performance tuning.
We will go over the following topics of discussions for typical scenarios that applies to SQL Server generally (not a specific version).
The take-away is you would understand better what to do to help your SQL Server reach optimal performance and proactively prevent problems.
