## Title: Cloud Powered SQL Server Performance Tuning Unleashed
## Abstract:
### Monitoring SQL Server is a combination of knowing what you need to monitor in your environment and how to accomplish that monitoring. For most of us, we'll need a way to detect blocking, finding long running queries, discover what filegroups need more space and which jobs failed and this is just as a start. We also need a way to capture more detail of how the system is being used at both the hardware and software level and hopefully be notified before a situation becomes critical to the overall system health.Â 

Gather all that information, at a constant rate and keeping it long enough to understand trends - that is a challenge that was used to be handled only by expensive tools.

Join this session to learn how Quest used the Cloud power to build Spotlight Cloud monitoring solution. A fully managed, enterprise-grade tool that can do all of the above, at a price that is affordable by organizations of any size.
