## Title: SQL Server 2016 Migration:A Technical/Project Management Approach
## Abstract:
### Just imagine that the management has given you an annual goal, to upgrade/migrate a SQL environment to SQL 2016(or 2014) and no project manager is available.  After this session you will be able to create a quick  dirty project plan and handle similar projects with ease and confidence.

We will start by discussing the ten Knowledge Areas and five Process Groups in a Project Management Framework. Each of these in turn, has multiple inputs/outputs; and each of them has multiple tools. Then we will learn how all these map to a SQL Server upgrade/migration project.  

Most projects fail due to ‘Scope Creep’ , bad Stakeholder Management and poor communication. We will learn how to handle each of these along the way towards a successful completion.

Finally we shall discuss a relatively new concept of a ‘Go Live’ environment that will help you save hundreds of hours of work and help you complete your SQL Server migration project “In Time In Budget”.
