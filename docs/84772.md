## Title: Football Feelings Quantified â€“ Ranking Clubs by Supporter Sentiment
## Abstract:
### Regardless of what football league you follow, some years the title chase can be quite boring. A football podcast in the US (Men in Blazers) came up with an interesting idea - what if we ranked the English Premier League by the Twitter sentiment of the supporters at the end of the match? I heard that episode and created the Premier League Mood Table for them to discuss on the podcast. While the premise of a mood table might be quite silly, the underlying concepts and technology are relevant to any company with a social media sales presence. Join me as I walk us through using Azure Logic Apps, Cognitive Services, and Azure SQL Database to store and analyze Twitter sentiment that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours as well!
