## Title: Temporal Tables in SQL 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 offers a cool new feature: Temporal Tables. This new functionality allows you to have the system "automagically" record all changes that happen to the data. Querying the data is also much easier than it was before with the workarounds that we had to use. In this hour you will understand the concept, learn how to create temporal tables and how to query them, and what the pros and cons are.
