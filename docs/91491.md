## Title: The Analyst’s Guide To Finding and Fixing Performance Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### Waiting too long for your SQL-based analytical jobs to finish? Need results in minutes instead of hours?

Bert Wagner, a principal business intelligence developer, regularly advises analysts and developers on how minor changes to their SQL-based jobs can dramatically improve performance. In this session he will show how to spot common anti-patterns that negatively impact performance, and apply solutions that will correct them.

Whether you strictly write SQL queries or incorporate those queries into tools like Python, R, Power BI, SAS, SSIS, etc… this session will teach you how to recognize poor-performing patterns in your queries as well as how to fix them for improved performance.
