## Title: SQL Development in a Developer's World
## Abstract:
### Database development tooling is evolving to meet the demands of modern application development methods, including automated pipelines, cross-platform environments, and multi-dimensional architectures.  Whether you are familiar with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or new to SQL projects, the SQL Database Projects extension is worth a look because it combines the Azure Data Studio interface with declarative database development capabilities. Beyond Azure Data Studio, the command line application SqlPackage.exe is a powerful tool for extracting and publishing database schemas. Add in a little magic* and let your imagination run wild with the opportunities to create efficiencies in your development workflow.
