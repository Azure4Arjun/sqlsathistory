## Title: I deleted 1 billion records, what happened next will shock you!
## Abstract:
### In this session we will give an overview of what Table Partitioning is, how can it be used to move large amounts of data quickly and how can it be used with a data archiving strategy to quickly and easily drop archived data from a table.  We will discuss the practical applications of table partitioning using scripts to generate new table partitions, move a partition to another table and discussion on how this can benefit you.   In this demo heavy session, attendees will be provided with scripts to get setup quickly so they can begin using the strategies to take control of rapid data archival
