## Title: Powershell Jumpstart for SQL Server DBAs
## Abstract:
### Powershell can be hard. As a language, it is fairly complex and provides a large array of functionality.  Fortunately, you can teach yourself how to use Powershell with tools that are built right into the language. This session will cover some Powershell fundamentals, how you can use Powershell itself to learn about concepts and syntax, and techniques for using Powershell with SQL Server. We will focus on core language patterns that you can use immediately, taking the mystery out of the code and helping you start writing your own Powershell scripts. The key to learning Powershell is using it and this session will give you a launchpad to start building your own tools.
