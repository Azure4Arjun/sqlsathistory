## Title: Data Mining Beyond Adventure Works
## Abstract:
### Microsoft provides excellent tutorials and information about data mining through the fictional Adventure Works demos.  However, what happens when you stray off that neat-and-tidy path?  Data miners should be concerned about data preparation, proper algorithm selection, and correct interpretation.  This interactive experience will consist of succinct audience participation demos to introduce some practical issues in real-world data mining.
