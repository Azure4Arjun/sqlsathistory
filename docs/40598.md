## Title: No stress with OSTRESS, Lessons Learned from a high traffic Replay attempt
## Abstract:
### One of my client engagements lately was about replaying a workload. The system had so many batches per second that I couldn't actually do a replay but had to run in stress mode and try to slow down the replay in such a way that it resembled the production system.

I'll show you how to do that amongst a bunch of other things that I learned and would love to share with you.
If you are thinking about using OSTRESS / RML Utilities to analyse your system and stress test it on a different machine to find bottlenecks, then this session is for you.
