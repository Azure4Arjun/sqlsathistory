## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Establishing a SLA
## Abstract:
### Most DBA's rarely establish Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the Management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point something goes really wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
Â 
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA.
