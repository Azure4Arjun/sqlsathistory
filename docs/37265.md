## Title: Abstraction Techniques for SQL Server Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### As enterprise Reporting Services solutions mature, maintenance and change requests of existing reports often result in environment inconsistencies and bottleneck new development.  Establishing proper abstraction between data and presentation layers can greatly reduce maintenance tasks and ensure development consistency.

In this session we’ll review the following abstraction techniques and how they can ease maintenance burden and promote consistency across your reporting infrastructure. 
•	Keep SQL within the Database not SSRS
•	One size fits all for parameter aliases 
•	Combine available and default data sets into one procedure
