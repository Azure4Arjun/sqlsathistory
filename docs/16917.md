## Title: Building Your Myth Busting Lab With Power BI
## Abstract:
### Did you know that a large portion of Information Workers’ and Data Analysts’ tasks are akin to “myth” busting? How can Power BI be used for these myth busting tasks? What if myth busting can be as easily done as few clicks or asking questions in plain English? This session will demonstrate how to create an ideal Myth Busting lab for data gathering, modelling, analysis, visualisation and collaboration all in one suite.
