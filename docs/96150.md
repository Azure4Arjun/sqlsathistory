## Title: Improving the Performance of Functions
## Abstract:
### Functions are stored blocks of code that can be reused in order to create simpler, more stable, and cleaner code. Functions can be great to have; however, they can also become a royal pain. Scalar and table valued functions can cause serious performance issues and the root cause may not be easy to find. In this session we will go over: (1) How to identify if a function is causing poor performance (with examples); (2) Methods that can be used to modify the function to greatly improve performance; (3) Improvements that come with SQL Server 2019 that may make you want to upgrade sooner rather than later.
