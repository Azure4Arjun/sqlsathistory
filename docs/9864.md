## Title: Stop Schemers with Schema Security
## Abstract:
### In releases prior to SQL Server 2005, database object owners and users were the same things. SQL Server 2005  introduced the concept of database schemas and the separation between database objects and ownership by users. An object owned by a database user is no longer tied to that user. The object now belongs to a schema â€“ a container that can hold many database objects. The schema owner may own one or many schemas. This concept creates opportunities to expose database objects within a database for consumption yet protect them from modification, direct access using poor query techniques, or removal by users other than the owner.
 
The ability to protect database objects in this way has many practical applications. One example of relevance is the protection of database objects in application development environments where developers and testers share the same set of database objects.
