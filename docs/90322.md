## Title: Reasons to use in-memory OLTP
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced in-memory OLTP in SQL Server version 2014, promising that queries will be up to 100 times faster. In this session, we'll look at the limitations of the traditional disk-based storage engine and explore why in-memory technology has the potential to be significantly faster. We'll also look at how SQL Server guarantees the durability of in-memory data using the checkpoint file pairs and the transaction log.
