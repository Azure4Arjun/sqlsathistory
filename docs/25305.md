## Speaker: Steve Schaneville
## Title: Unit Tests in Action – an exercise in updating legacy code, and how unit tests play a critical role
## Abstract:
### This session will attempt to show how to use unit tests to confidently make changes to existing production code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.  It will do so in a “hands on presentation” sort of manner, as most of the time will be spent in code rather than in slides.  The intent is to demonstrate (by using a real-world example, not slides and theory) the importance of having/creating well written unit tests before updating production code, and will be targeted to persuade the developer who is not yet sold on writing a solid suite of unit tests.  During the session, we will take an production existing framework and make changes to it using the following techniques:
 
1)      Use unit tests to ensure existing functionality does not break
2)      Use Code Digger to ensure that we test all possible code paths
3)      Use Fakes (including both Stubs and Shims) to isolate code paths and create targeted unit tests
