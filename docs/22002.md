## Title: Introduction to SQL Server 2012 MDS and DQS
## Abstract:
### This presentation introduces the upgraded features of SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services (MDS) and the new service, SQL Server 2012 Data Quality Services (DQS).

MDS is a solution for master data management. First released in SQL Server 2008 R2, this upgraded version includes many new features and enhancements, including a new web interface developed with Silverlight, an Excel add-in to support simplified model creation and easier data updates and management.

DQS is a new knowledge-driven data cleansing solution, and it supports building knowledge bases that provide correction and de-duplication of data.
