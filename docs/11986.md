## Title: Introducing Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will introduce the audience to Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel. "Data Explorer" is an Excel add-in that enhances the self-service Business Intelligence experience in Excel by simplifying data discovery and access. It has often been referred to as the end-user ETL tool, but I believe that it will also be a valuable tool for all technical staff. This demo rich presentation will expose many great features of the newest addition to the Microsoft self-service offering.
