## Title: Azure Machine Learning Studio
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning is working its way into all of our businesses. One of the biggest challenges faced by the data science or analytic teams that perform work in predictive analytics is how to operationalize the models that they create. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is a fully hosted machine learning platform that streamlines the process of creating, training and testing predictive models and allows you to put them into production hosted in the cloud. 

In this session we will introduce the Azure ML platform, discuss some of the current uses, and understand how to overcome some of the common challenges with hosting models in the cloud.
