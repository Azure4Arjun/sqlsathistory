## Title: SQL Server Performance Related DMVs 
## Abstract:
### There are number of tools available on the market for the SQL Server performance troubleshooting. But do we use the full power of the internal SQL Server Data Management Views (DMVs)? Some very challenging issues can be solved using DMVs. What the Dynamic Management Views are? How diagnostics data is getting populated?
