## Title: Data Warehouse Indexes
## Abstract:
### A datawarehouse environment is used differently than a transactional environment, so architecture and indexing strategies should also be different.  In this presentation, we review what the ultimate goal of an index really is, what the point of a data warehouse is, and how they relate to each other.  You will also learn common practices for indexing the different types of warehouse tables, specifically dimension tables, fact tables, and staging tables.  We will review cases when it is useful to have summary level fact tables, in addition to detail level fact tables.  Then, lastly, we will look at the benefits, and gotchas, of using columnstore indexes.
