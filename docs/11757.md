## Speaker: Colin Smith
## Title: Intermediate Powershell for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Now that you know the basics, we will dive into functions and profiles. I will show you how to create your own function library so you can call these functions whenever you need to. This session will be very demo driven, and I will show you how to write scripts in order to offload the simple repeatable tasks that you have to do.
