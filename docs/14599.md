## Title: SQL Server Security in an Insecure World
## Abstract:
### One of the first responsibilities of a SQL Server DBA is to safeguard the data and protect it from unauthorized access.

In this session you'll learn how to secure your SQL Server infrastructure and how to take advantage of the numerous security features available in the product.
