## Title: Working with Server Side Traces
## Abstract:
### You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.
