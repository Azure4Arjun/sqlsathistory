## Title: The Data Warehouse is Dead! Long Live the Data Warehouse! 
## Abstract:
### Okay, the Data Warehouse isn't really dead. But, it's time to think past your favorite textbook and begin looking at practical solutions that fit the schedule, budget, and team you're working with. In this session, we'll discuss design options, implementation considerations, and lessons gained from the many mistakes the presenter has made over the years. This is a highly interactive session, so bring your ideas, opinions, and experiences.
