## Title: Near real time analytics with Azure Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### As recently as 5 years ago, most companies could not afford the technology or did not possess the in-house skill sets needed to implement real-time analytics. At least not without involving a lot of money, a large development team and some duct tape. However, in the last few years, Microsoft has made this type of technology available at an affordable cost (and without the need of large dev team or duct tape) in the form of Azure Stream Analytics. 
In this session we will review the architecture of Azure Stream Analytics, a walk through to implement this technology and a live demo with audience participation using PowerBI and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
