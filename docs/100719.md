## Title: Tableau eye for the PowerBI guy
## Abstract:
### A quick glance at the sessions scheduled shows there are lots of talks about PowerBI.  This is your chance to check out the competition.  I've been excited about Tableau for over 10 years.  I'll show you why I think it's the best choice for building a data driven culture in your organization.  We will explore the Tableau Prep tool, Tableau Builder and take a look at Tableau Server.
