## Speaker: Clive Trott
## Title: Data Visualisation
## Abstract:
### Probably the most important part of any Business Intelligence project. What are the different options for presenting data to end users? What are the pros and cons of each? What are the requirements for each of the different options? This session will show you that there is more than one way to visualise data and what works best.

Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Dave Dustin
## Title: Myths and misconceptions
## Abstract:
### There are a great many theories, anti-patterns and just plain wrong ideas that people (mostly Devs, but including DBAs) believe about SQL Server. 
Yes, it’s enterprise ready. 
No, it doesn’t magically tune/tweak itself (it needs some lovin’ from time to time (just nowhere near as much as Oracle)).  
We’re going to look into debunking some of these falsehoods.

# Interpreting DMV's  practical uses
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Jannie Muller
## Title: Interpreting DMV's  practical uses
## Abstract:
### The talk will be about how to interpret DMVs in order to troubleshoot real databases.
The talk will cover a logical flow of dmvs for fault finding, inspecting configuration and setting up maintenance plans by using dmvs.
Topics will also include how to visualize data from dmvs in excel for quick conclusions.

It also look at some best practises for configuration and maintenance.

# PowerShell for Beginners
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Kent Chenery
## Title: PowerShell for Beginners
## Abstract:
### You've heard about PowerShell but the amount of braces, at symbols and percent signs reminded you of a painful Perl experience.
You're frustrated at having to run the same piece of code on all your servers time after time?
You've only accidently clicked on the PowerShell icon and thought "white on blue is nice, but what makes this so good?"
You've heard its something to do with .Net, but you're a DBA and .Net is just for developers right?

If that sounds like you, then this session is for you.  We will cover some basics of PowerShell and take a look at some of the things it can offer the DBA and make their life a little bit easier.

# Extended Events - A whirlwind tour!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: Extended Events - A whirlwind tour!
## Abstract:
### We've all used SQL profiler, and most of us are familiar with server side traces.
SQL SERVER 2008 brought us Extended Events (XEvents), a more lightweight and flexible form of tracing.
However SQL SERVER 2008 has no native UI support for XEvents, which could be one reason for their apparent slow up take.
Learning the syntax now - and seeing what goes on behind the scenes of an XEvent session - will give you a firm understanding of their power and flexibility and place you in the position of knowing what is going on in the background when SQL SERVER 2012 brings us a fully functional UI for XEvents management.

# Query Optimizer Deep Dive
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Paul White
## Title: Query Optimizer Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Take your query writing and performance diagnostic skills to the next level by becoming familiar with the internals of the SQL Server query optimizer and the execution plans it produces.  This 400-level session covers deep optimizer internals and little-known query processor details that will give you new insights into the way SQL Server works behind the scenes.  Armed with this information, you will be better placed to write queries that optimize well, and to debug plan-related performance problems when they occur.

# If you had $10K what would you spend it on?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Peter Ward
## Title: If you had $10K what would you spend it on?
## Abstract:
### You are looking at the Bill of Materials for the new shiny server that you are going to purchase for SQL Server and you realise that there is still $10,000 in the hardware budget - how do you spend it?  Do you increase the core density, maybe increase the RAM or maybe even look at adding some solid state storage to the storage array.  In this session we will explore how some small hardware investments made in the right place can pimp your next SQL Server deployment.

# The Dark Art of Performance Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Peter Ward
## Title: The Dark Art of Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### Despite all of the enhancements to the instrumentation in SQL Server, many database professionals still view performance tuning as a dark art.  This session will provide database administrators and developers with valuable information on SQL Server performance tuning concepts.  This presentation will walk you through proven performance tuning strategies and teach you how to use SQL Server tools to identify a performance bottleneck, isolate the root cause, apply possible resolutions, and then quantify performance improvements.

# Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Paul te Braak
## Title: Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
## Abstract:
### Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language).

# Query Tuning Using Lessons Learned from SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Query Tuning Using Lessons Learned from SSIS
## Abstract:
### I'm sure you've noticed the similarities between an execution plan and an SSIS Data Flow Task. Of course there are major differences, such as the fact that you write Data Flow Tasks, whereas execution plans are created based on the T-SQL that you pass to the Query Optimizer and other things such as indexes, statistics and constraints. This talk will consider some of the things that SSIS developers look for when creating an effective Data Flow Task, and show you how those same concerns can be considered when writing queries.

# Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-136)
Event Date: 14-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
## Abstract:
### There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.

## Title: New Features of SSIS 2012
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is a leading tool in the data warehouse industry - used for performing extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) operations. ETL is responsible for the extraction of data from several sources, their cleansing, customization, and loading into a central repository normally called Data Warehouse or Data Mart.
SSIS 2012 comes with great new features which helps ETL Developers and Architects to create more robust and reliable packages to transfer data. This session will have a brief look at new features in SSIS 2012 and their usages in real-world scenarios.features such as; parameters, data flow changes, project deployment model, development changes, logging, environments, reports and ... will be discusse
