# Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance
## Abstract:
### This session will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you some of the top Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.

# Tools for a DB TakeOver
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Tools for a DB TakeOver
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore some practical scripts to help create database documentation. We will be looking at how to make some of those documentation tasks easier, while giving you greater insight into your database(s). Attendees will be able to leave with some additional tools for their toolbox and through the use of these scripts the attendee will be able to perform these tasks faster.

# 12 ways to write badly performing T-SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: 12 ways to write badly performing T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Database performance is a hot topic and there are often questions asked pertaining to the best way to write T-SQL queries. 

In this presentation, the attendee will NOT be shown the best manner in which to write queries but rather numerous ways of how to write poorly performing queries, with the hope that the attendee  will obtain an understanding of what NOT to do.  

The user will be guided through each query, be shown why it’s not the optimal way of doing things and then shown a well-written query that achieves the same results.

## Speaker: Luis de Sousa
## Title: Database Design Methodologies
## Abstract:
### "Data lasts longer than code, treat it right" - In this session we take a look at database design phases, data modelling and some tools to help you along the way.

#  "GIS in SQL and SSRS using Statistics SA data"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Mark Stacey
## Title:  "GIS in SQL and SSRS using Statistics SA data"
## Abstract:
### "Many data are publicly  available , including Geographic Information Systems points, and economic metrics. In this session, Mark will show a couple of these sources, and show how to import this geographic and economic information into a SQL database, and display it as a map in SSRS"

# Get your Oracle data into SQL Server faster!

## Speaker: Phlippie Smit
## Title: Get your Oracle data into SQL Server faster!
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will explore the usage and performance of the Microsoft Connector Version 1.1 for Oracle by Attunity.  Delegates will leave the session empowered to replace their current SQL Server Integration Packages to use the new connector to dramatically increase data transfer speed between SQL Server and Oracle.  The session is a must for BI developers working in heterogeneous environments where Oracle source systems or Data Warehouses and Microsoft BI tools co-exist.

# Recursive Queries: Beautiful Events Always Recur 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: Recursive Queries: Beautiful Events Always Recur 
## Abstract:
### (Eng  Afrikaans)
Within the realm of financial instruments, business structure and rules are highly hierarchical in nature. Investor funds consist of one or many levels of asset ID’s which in turn are comprised of one or more lots. This certainly poses interesting challenges when it comes to creating efficient and effective detailed and summary level queries and reports. This beginners' to intermediate level hands-on presentations is aimed at showing the attendee how we handle recursive scenarios,utilizing several techniques including, recursive T-SQL, code using memory TABLEs (as custom stacks) and CTE's.

## Speaker: Stephan Lawson
## Title: The Transaction Log and VLF performance.
## Abstract:
### Look at what happens to a transaction in the log file, and take a deep dive into VLF's with a live demo to see how they can affect performance if managed badly.

# Baseline my Database
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#83-Johannesburg-2011)
Event Date: 07-05-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Theo Potgieter
## Title: Baseline my Database
## Abstract:
### As a DBA I always get asked by my  DBA peers “How many I/Os, Deadlocks, Scans etc. does your database perform?”. Very valid question but in what context? The starting point of answering the context questions starts with implementing a baseline for your database. In this session I will propose concepts and raise important things to consider when implementing a baseline on a production database.
