## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services 2008
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoftâ€™s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this introductory session, I will cover topics like: 
- What is reporting services and what can it be used for? 
- New Features included in 2008 R2 
- Architectural Overview 
- Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access.
