## Title: SSIS Olympics
## Abstract:
### Did you know that 38 hundredths of a second separated gold and silver in the 4-man bobsledding race at the Vancouver Winter Olympics? What did the right setup mean for the US bobsled team in Vancouver? Everything!!! Choosing the right components and settings can make all the difference in the world. The same holds true for the setup and performance of packages in SSIS. In this demo heavy session, we will glide through parts of SSIS that, when used correctly, will make your packages gold medal contenders.
