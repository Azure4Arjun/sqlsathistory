## Title: Benchmarking, Baselines and Monitoring Storage
## Abstract:
### Benchmarking, Baselines and Monitoring Storage
There are several steps in the life cycle of your storage systems. We have several tools to help us understand our storage systems from initial deployment through its useful life. 
We will cover:
SQLIO, a specific SQL Server benchmarking tool.
Iometer, a general IO benchmarking tool and simulator.
SQLIOSim a specific SQL Server base lining tool and simulator. 
TPC style testing focused on TPC-C, TPC-E and TPC-H.
Monitoring your system using WMI and virtual file stats.
Finally, what it all really means, how to read these results and compare them with each other.
With these tools you can plan, deploy and manage your storage for years to come!
