### If you're using Dynamic Data Masking, Row-Level-Security or just SQL Server and you don't know how to hack it, then come to this session. I have some demos may leave you in aah. I'll show you how to also protect yourself against these hacks, plus how to add your database to source control with Azure DevOps, TFS or GitHub to better manage your database changes/deployments.
