## Title: Azure ML vs Cognitive Services Recommendations
## Abstract:
### Anyone who has already gained experience with Azure ML knows how hard it is to find a suitable algorithm that fits the task.
Cognitive services are becoming increasingly powerful and easy to address. With the focus on suggestions (Customers who bought this product also bought ...) I compare Azure ML and Cognitive Servies Recommendations. The result is the same for both, a proposal which could also be interesting. Only the how is for the developer significantly different.
