## Title: SQL Window functions in SQL Server 2008 and later
## Abstract:
### "Just what the heck is a window function and why should I care?"  Have you ever needed to provide a running subtotal or average in your dataset?  Need to provide a total by customer or a grand total on each row?  Need to assign row numbers or counts that change when a certain value in your data changes!  Window functions to the rescue!  That's why you should care.
