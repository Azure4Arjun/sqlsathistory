## Title: Dr. Bot, when AI meets helthcare
## Abstract:
### Do you remember when in films humans are taken care of medical robots? Well, we are not yet there but we will be in time.  AI is getting increasingly sophisticated at what humans do but depending on the area they can be more efficient. In addition, thanks to the NLP techniques the AI is getting better in understanding humans. So, in this talk an application of AI is presented for helping the diagnosis of rare diseases and helping doctors to making decisions in their treatments. In addition, the application is going to be taken to cloud in order to get accessible for any doctor to request it and help them to make a more accurate diagnosis.
