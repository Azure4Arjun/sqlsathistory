## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.
