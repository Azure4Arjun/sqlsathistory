### Join Adam Saxton (@GuyInACube) as he looks at how to interact with on-premises data when creating reports and dashboards for Power BI. This will start with Power BI Desktop, and the choices you have for SQL Server and Analysis Services. It will then move to the cloud and look at hosting your files on OneDrive for Business, and what this means for data freshness. 
 
He will then look at the Personal Gateway along with the new Power BI Gateway for enterprises and how that helps you work with live data. 
 
It will finish off with looking at some troubleshooting tools available to you when working with data refresh.
