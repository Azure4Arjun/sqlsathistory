# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#42-Columbus-2010)
Event Date: 26-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

# Database Design Patterns 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#42-Columbus-2010)
Event Date: 26-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Patterns 
## Abstract:
### Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.

# A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#42-Columbus-2010)
Event Date: 26-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Jeremiah Peschka
## Title: A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

# Programming with FileStream Object
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#42-Columbus-2010)
Event Date: 26-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Sam Nasr
## Title: Programming with FileStream Object
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced the FileStream object.  This allowed developers to resolve an age long dilemma of storing large binary files in the database or accessing them on the file system.  SS08 provides the best of both worlds while allowing applications to access the data readily through the FileStream object via Transact SQL or File I/O.

# Avoid Slow SSAS Queries: MDX Query Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#42-Columbus-2010)
Event Date: 26-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Craig Utley
## Title: Avoid Slow SSAS Queries: MDX Query Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Do you have SSAS queries that you feel should be faster? Multidimensional Expressions, or MDX, is the language used to work with Analysis Services. Similar to SQL for the relational engine, MDX is a language for queries and DDL statements on multidimensional cubes in Analysis Services. Troubleshooting slow MDX queries is often challenging because the level of support provided by the tools and the Analysis Services engine is not as mature as that found in the relational engine. This session covers the methods for examining slow queries using the SQL Profiler and Performance Monitor to determine the need for aggregations, caching problems, memory constraints, and so forth. Best practices for optimizing MDX will be examined.

## Speaker: Craig Utley
## Title: Do It Right: Best Practices for Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Are you seeking practical, in-depth technical advice for building a BI solution using SSAS? Analysis Services changed tremendously with the advent of SQL Server 2005. It introduced a new way of building dimensions and cubes that required a new way of modeling the solution. This session examines the best practices for properly designing cubes for performance and usability. It discusses some high-level topics but also looks at advanced topics such as alternative approaches to many-to-many dimensions, SCOPE statements, aggregation design, scalability issues, processing techniques, server properties, and more.
