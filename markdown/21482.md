## Title: Introduction to NoSQL
## Abstract:
### Understanding when and how to use NoSQL is already becoming essential, even for database professionals currently focusing only on the RDBMS world. This session will explain NoSQL for the SQL Server professional, discussing the history and needs that led to NoSQL solutions and the strengths and weaknesses in comparison with RDBMSs. We'll also explore the several NoSQL data models available in the market today (Key-Value, Column-Family, Document, and Graph) and cover the current solutions that implement them (Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, etc.).
