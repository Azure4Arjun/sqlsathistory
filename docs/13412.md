## Speaker: Doug Purnell
## Title: Congrats on your promotion to DBA, now what?
## Abstract:
### For those of you that donâ€™t have a full time DBA on staff, this session is built around you. I will give you the skills and tools necessary to successfully manage Microsoft SQL Server. Automation is the key to any monitoring effort and SQL Server is no different. I will show you publicly available tools and scripts to alert you when key areas of SQL Server are being stressed. Proactively monitoring SQL Server will make you more efficient and allow you to continue your success within your role.
