## Title: Demystifying Always On Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### Always On Availability Groups (AGs) have evolved since their introduction in SQL Server 2012. Not only is there the “classic” form of AGs, but now there are Basic Availability Groups, Distributed Availability Groups, Domain Independent Availability Groups, and Read Scale Groups. Also complicating the picture is virtualization, hyperconverged, the public cloud, Linux, as well as containers which is new to SQL Server 2019. Come to this session to learn what AGs are – and are not – today, the differences between the various AG and deployment options, and how you can harness the power of them in your environments.
