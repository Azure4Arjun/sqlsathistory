## Title: Azure Data Factory 101
## Abstract:
### You're tasked with moving SSIS packages to Azure. How do you tackle these existing ETL processes to work seamlessly in Azure? Join David Nguyen and Anandi Subramanian as they demonstrate the basics, highlight some challenges, and things you need to know about Azure Data Factory Version 2, Microsoft's new data integration and orchestration engine for Azure. The speakers will discuss similarities and differences between ADF and SSIS, and walk through strategies for "lifting and shifting" SSIS workloads directly to ADF and Azure.
