## Title: Commodity Server Provisioning for Database Servers
## Abstract:
### Powerful servers are now being commoditized and are becoming mainstream and very affordable. However, most of us, with the exception of  those dealing with the very large exotic server setups, lack knowledge on how we acquire off-the-shelf servers and components relative to how our SQL Server databases be after sometime. In this session, learn the basics on what to look for in a hardware that would fit to our specifications as database servers relative to our needs. This session will also cover best practices in setting up and configuring these servers (e.g. RAID, paritioning, etc)
