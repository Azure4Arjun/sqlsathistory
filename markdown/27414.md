## Title: Maximizing SQL Server Performance: Tuning the Processor, RAM, Disk and Network Subsystems
## Abstract:
### You can't escape hardware or the laws of physics. Ultimately your SQL Server instance will be using the processor, memory, disk and network subsystems. In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will go through the various subsystems and examine how the SQL Server database engine works with them and what configuration options exist. Along the way he will discuss how to tune the hardware, operating system and SQL Server for maximal performance.
