## Title: Creating Dashboards with PerformancePoint Server 2
## Abstract:
### The monitoring and analytics (MA) portion of PerformancePoint Server allows companies to manage their key performance indicators.  This session will discuss methods of designing dashboards, deployment scenarios, and ways to integrate SharePoint with the PerformancePoint dashboard.  While the next version of the PerformancePoint Server MA will be included in SharePoint, the design concepts from PPS 2007 will still be applicable in future versions.
