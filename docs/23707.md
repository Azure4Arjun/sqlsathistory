## Title: Code First with Entity Framework
## Abstract:
### Most developers are probably more familiar with the database first and model first design methods in Entity Framework, simply because these areas reached maturity earlier in the product life cycle.

This session will introduce you to the main concepts and core objects, methods, properties, etc. used to build your data access layer with code first methodology in Entity Framework.
