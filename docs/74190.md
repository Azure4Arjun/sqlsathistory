## Title: It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016/17
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system-maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.
