## Title: Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part II
## Abstract:
### This is part two of a two part series, looking at performance tuning (i.e. performance troubleshooting) from the beginning. Part II is about the next steps after taking a look at some of the free performance analysis tools. This session will go into more detail about how to capture the current transactions with tools like sp_WhoIsActive stored procedure, Wait Stats, performance counters and Extended Events. 

This is a very demo intensive session some basic issues and performance analysis that will be used as a starting point for performance tuning. 

There will be homework!
