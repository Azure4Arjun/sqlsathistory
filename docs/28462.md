## Title: Build Your Own Search Engine With SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 once again improves on the classic built-in SQL Server full-text search (FTS) functionality by making FTS more efficient and transparent. In this course attendees will learn both the basics of the new Integrated FTS (iFTS) and how to build user-friendly Google-style search interfaces on top of SQL Server for the benefit of their end users.
