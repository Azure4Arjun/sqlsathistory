## Speaker: Steve Schaneville
## Title: Unit Testing in a Team - A Kick Starter
## Abstract:
### I (and a team of people much sharper than me) tried to push unit testing onto established development teams on multiple occasions in the past, and we failed repeatedly... until we figured out the things that we'll discuss in this session.  We will cover a set of rules and guidelines for bringing the practice of unit testing into a team of developers who may or may not be interested in persuing unit testing.  We will include patterns and approaches for ensuring that the tests that we write are highly legible, maintainable, and bring genuine value to the team.  We will learn to structure our unit testing practices so that our efforts do not fade away in time due to lack of upkeep.

Unlike most of my sessions in the past, we won't be writing any code or doing demos in this session.  This will be more about the patterns and rules.  Target audience is anyone interested in bringing unit tests to their development team, or anyone has struggled to keep unit testing efforts afloat in the past.
