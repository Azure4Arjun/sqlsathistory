## Title: Running SQL Server in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine â€“ Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure gives you a choice in where to host your SQL data, with both SQL Server running in a VM and Windows Azure SQL database. Ongoing innovations in SQL/VM and SQL DB enable both low overall TCO for management of existing applications/services and an efficient platform for the new breed of cloud applications/services. Additionally the ability to mix and match existing and new applications in the same hosted service, and to integrate with on-premises applications and networks in hybrid models provides tremendous flexibility. This session will take a deep look at the best practices when provisioning and deploying a SQL Server in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine.
