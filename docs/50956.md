## Title: Predictive maintenance in aerospace with Cortana Intelligence Suite
## Abstract:
### A lot of machine learning projects these days centers around predictive maintenance. This session will provide a deep-dive technical walk-through of  the reference architecture described in the Cortana Intelligence Solution Template for predictive maintenance in aerospace. We will have a technical and demo-heavy look at the different parts making up the solution.  A few common business scenarios will also be mentioned, but not discussed at length. Some familiarity with machine learning in general and the services in Cortana Intelligence suite is assumed.
