## Title: Automated Deployments - Lowering the risk of database releases
## Abstract:
### Releasing changes can feel like the most stressful part of managing databases. Whether we're in a development shop reviewing changes from several unique development instances, a healthcare shop walking a series of changes through an extreme change management process, or the only DBA pushing manual changes into production, hitting that final button is stressful.

In this session, we'll build a deployment pipeline that will reduce the stress and risks we're used to from manual deployments while providing a framework for cleaner change tracking and management, shorter release windows, and the ability to keep numerous environments in sync with the latest available changes without constant restores. While the primary focus will be an end-to-end demo, we'll also discuss the business value of deployment pipelines, how they reduce risk and enable us to move faster, and alternatives to the set of tools used in the demo.
