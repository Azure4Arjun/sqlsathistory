## Title: To click or to type, that is the question 
## Abstract:
### When adminstering SQL Server, in SSMS are you a clicker or a typer? This session explores the use of the GUI vs. using scripting in SSMS to get day to day tasks accomplished, with a bent toward scripting for increased accuracy, control and speed. Tasks are illustrated through the use of the Day-to-Day section of Brad McGeehee's Sure DBA Checklist at http://www.bradmcgehee.com , Used with Permission and Great Thanks.
