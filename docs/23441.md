## Speaker: Ronald Dameron
## Title: SQL Server Security Easy Button
## Abstract:
### Attendees will learn how to define a permission set with a single script that allows your company’s DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies. 
DBAs will leave this session with an easy to implement, low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain the server but not be able to view user data. 
In addition, I’ll talk about our DBA’s real world experience with reduced permissions
