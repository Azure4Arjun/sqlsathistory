## Title: EntityFramework 360:  CodeOnly 4.1
## Abstract:
### Come see the new "code-centric" approach to managing your application data. In this session, we’ll • Explore the Entity Framework 4.1, its components and show how it works • Define an object model, implementing persistent POCO classes, while customizing the mapping via the tool's fluent API • Walk through a variety of examples that show how to interact with the model • Demonstrate how the Entity Framework automatically tracks data changes and generates updates. You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the new “code only” extensions enable you to implement a code-centric approach to store persistence.
