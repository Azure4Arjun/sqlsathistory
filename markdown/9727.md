## Title: Everything You Ever Knew About SSIS Is Null and Void
## Abstract:
### With the release SQL Server Integration Services 2012, Microsoft did a massive overhaul to the deployment platform for SSIS. Gone is the old file based deployment system and MSDB. New to SSIS is the Integration Services Catalog. 

Along with the catalog came many new improvements, such as package and project parameters. No longer do you have to mess around with ugly configuration files, or the mess of passing data between packages. Also included are new reports which you can use to examine your packages as they run, or see the status of past runs. 

In this session we'll look at how the new project based deployment model simplifies your SSIS coding. We'll also take a dive into the catalog, uncovering the wealth of information it can provide.
