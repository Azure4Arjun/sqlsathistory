## Title: Create Your Own Aggregate
## Abstract:
### Have you ever flipped the pages of Books Online, only to find that the aggregate function you need is simply not there? So why not add it?
Ever since SQL Server 2005, you can easily create your own aggregate functions. All it takes is a bit of .NET code.
This session will show you exactly how to create a CLR user-defined aggregate function, and how to use it in your queries. But it will also show you many workarounds to avoid having to do this for many commonly requested aggregates.
