## Title: Boring is stable, stable is good - best practices in practice
## Abstract:
### Everybody is talking about best practices, and like standards, most everybody has them. But why do they look like they do, and why would you use a specific set of "best practices" that someone has put together? This session goes through my set of best practices that I've accumulated over 20 years of DBA work, disassembles each and every one of them to see how they came about and discusses why I still use them - or don't. There is no such thing as the ultimate best practices, but I aim to provide the attendee with as much food for thought as possible in order to let each and everyone decide on their own path forward for their own set of best practices.
The session covers primarily SQL Server 2012 to 2016, with SQL Server 2017 thrown in for good measure.
