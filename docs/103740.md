## Title: Microsoft SQL Server 2019 big data clusters
## Abstract:
### Starting with SQL Server 2019, SQL Server Big Data Clusters allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers running on Kubernetes. These components are running side by side to enable you to read, write, and process big data from Transact-SQL or Spark, allowing you to easily combine and analyze your high-value relational data with high-volume big data. Join me in this session and I will show you how it is easy to deploy SQL Server Big Data Clusters and start using it.
