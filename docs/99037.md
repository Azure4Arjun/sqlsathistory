## Title: Data Governance Implications of the California Consumer Protectio
## Abstract:
### The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) has substantial implications on the data governance and data management practices of all companies that have customers in California.   The CCPA will come into effect in 2020 and has substantial potentially large monetary penalties for non-compliance.   Are you ready?   We will discuss what the CCPA is and who is required to comply with the law.   A presentation of MetaCenter, an enterprise metadata management and data governance solution,  will be given to show how a tool can be used to help you comply with the data inventory and data lineage requirements of the CCPA.
