## Title: Practical Partitioning
## Abstract:
### What can you do when you have an ever growing database, shrinking maintenance windows and increased demands from application queries?   Enter "Table Partitioning"!  
In this session we’ll initially talk to the basics of how partitioning works, and why it may be beneficial to your database.  We’ll then demonstrate real practical methods to show how partitioning techniques can be applied to tables and the positive and negative impacts partitioning will have to your database queries and design.  We’ll then wrap up with a demonstration on leveraging partitioning for database maintenance operations such as optimisations and the implementation of partial database backups.
This session will have a strong focus on real, practical, and hands-on partitioning methods and key concepts that DBA’s can apply from Day 1.
