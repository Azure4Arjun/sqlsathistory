## Title: Transactional Replication for Beginners
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication is a powerful tool and surprisingly easy to implement, but there are times when you might need to go beyond the wizard. This session will demo setting up replication in under 10 minutes, then look at how to handle some situations you might run into such as needing to delete rows on the publisher but not the subscriber, applying an alternate set of permissions and indexes to subscribers, troubleshooting replication agents, and more!
