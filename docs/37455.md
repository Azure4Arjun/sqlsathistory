## Title: Clusters Your Way: #SANLess Clusters for Physical, Virtual  Cloud Environ.
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Cluster MVP Denny Cherry will discuss how to create #SANLess clusters in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible: local high performance clusters leveraging SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage and clustering in the cloud - no SAN (or SAN Admin required). He will also discuss cost-effective strategies to get HA and DR protection without a SAN.
