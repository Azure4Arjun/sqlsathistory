## Title: Designing an SSIS Framework
## Abstract:
### Enterprise data integration changed with the introduction of the SSIS Catalog. Implementing enterprise data integration often requires functionality beyond the rich features provided by the SSIS Catalog. Building on his previous work in the field of Data Integration Life Cycle Management (DILM) and SSIS Frameworks development, a Data Integration Architect with 10 years of SSIS experience explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS Catalog-integrated Framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and parameter configuration.

In this session, you will learn:
- A method for migrating packages from Development, through the data integration life cycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Manager Properties.
- A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution.
- A method for customizing enterprise data integration reporting.
