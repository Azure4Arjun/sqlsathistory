## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination. Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again. BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy. In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.
