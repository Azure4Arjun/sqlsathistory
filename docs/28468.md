## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Spatial Data
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced support for new spatial data features -- providing powerful visualization capabilities to your users. In this course attendees will learn the basics of the Geography and Geometry data types, spatial indexing, and spatial calculations. We will also explore more advanced uses for spatial data: loading spatial data into SQL Server from other formats, the new Map control in SSRS, and using online mapping software like Bing Maps to visualize SQL Server spatial data.
