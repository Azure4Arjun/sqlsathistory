## Title: Database Continuous Integration Panel with Amir Fourey  Hila Bar
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration is a development and deployment methodology that has been around for many years. Many dev teams use this methodology to constantly build and deploy application releases. But for some reason, the database world has been left behind. Even today, there is still not a single methodology or tool that really works. Each organization creates its own tools and methodologies to manage the integration and deployment of database changes. Why is it so hard?
