## Speaker: Javier Caceres
## Title: Data Architectural Patterns in C#
## Abstract:
### This session will present the following topics:
(1) Data architectural patterns that can be implemented in a modern Software Architecture for favoring non-functional requirements such as resource management (concurrency, even distribution) and resource demand (incremental caching, hash partitions).
(2) Design techniques (like Resource Pooling, Do Not Wait / Fire and Forget , preferred caching components) and principles (like Eventual consistency, CAP theorem, Fine grained vs coased grained, Statelessness, Idempotency and fallacy of zero latency) to improve the application performance in the data access layer.

This session is for Software Developers/Designers/Architects and Data Architects interested in exploring the available options
