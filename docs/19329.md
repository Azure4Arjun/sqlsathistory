## Speaker: Luca Zavarella
## Title: Agile SSIS with Biml (IT)
## Abstract:
### Are you tired to waste your time in a “monkey work” spent in SSIS packages? Are you tired to fight against packages' corrupted metadata and side effects due to abrupt changes in metadata? It's time to get in touch with Biml, a new player in the Microsoft BI realm. We’ll see how Biml can help us in a BI project, automating the ETL packages' development. In particular, we’ll see it in action in the Staging phase of the project.
