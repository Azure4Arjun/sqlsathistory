## Title: Managing Memory for Optimal Performance
## Abstract:
### Memory is one part of the holy trinity of resources consumed by SQL Server, the others being CPU and disk. Most people know how to look at disk latency and throughput and then take remedial measures to fix those issues. But what about memory issues?
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses memory and various caches, how to gauge memory pressure, and how to address the significant problems it can cause.
You will leave with a much clearer understanding of how to monitor and manage memory consumption within SQL Server using native Dynamic Management Objects.
