## Abstract:
### Join me in a presentation on how to create your Azure environment for Data and Analytics.

- creating a template to make POC a possibility (how to recreate on demand)  
- real world situations and lessons learned in Azure situations 
- consumption of that data through Power BI Embedded

This presentation will include creation of an Hybrid solution for Operational Analytics in Azure using Azure SQL DB, an historical Azure SQL DW and using Azure Analysis Services to create the ultimate Data and Analytics experience in the cloud.
Make the move from on prem BI solutions to an Azure Data and Analytics solution.
