## Title: Python revolution in SQL Server world
## Abstract:
### Python is one of the most popular languages this days and we are very excited to have an ability to use Python inside SQL Server stored procedures starting SQL Server 2017.

Machine learning is not the only usecase for this wonderful feature, it can solve many challenges when dealing with text files, bulk loads and even simplify ETL flows when you need to move data from databases other than SQL Server. Moreover, you can offload the big data querying to nosql database and use Python to get the results into SQL server.

Target Audience:
Application and Infrastructure DBAs that want to see various usages for Python language from inside SQL Server stored procedures.
