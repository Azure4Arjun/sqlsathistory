## Title: NoLock,  What does it exactly do ?
## Abstract:
### It must be the most common query-hint but exactly why; what does it do?
In this 60 minutes talk,  the NoLock-hint will be explained.
Starting simplistic with explaining the way the ignoring locks works, quick touch on isolation-levels and continue with more difficult example and concept; Read-Past, Ghost-Reads and even duplicate reads.
Only to end with how the 'magic speed' comes to be and what other ways can used to achieve the extra speed.
