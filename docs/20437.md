## Title: A consolidation architecture to host 1000s of DBs
## Abstract:
### In this session we’ll explore and examine a proven architecture designed for consolidating SQL Server workloads using Hyper-V.  This architecture saves you time by simplifying deployment of a virtualization platform for running databases in a “n-tier” datacenter or a cloud environment. Perhaps you are interested in building your own, this session will help you understand exactly what’s required to design a complete high-end mission-critical architecture built on Hyper-V.  Additionally, I’ll outline field proven database migration and consolidation methods and strategies.   Finally, we’ll review the design’s HA and scalability options and capabilities.
