## Title: MDX, it is not that hard!
## Abstract:
### My first experience with MDX was: good, it looks like SQL: SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE. On my second glance it turned out to be completely different than SQL. But after a while SQL and MDX started to feel similar. In this session I bring you to the point of seeing the similarities instead of the differences. We will use your SQL experience to give you a head start with MDX. The session is also good for those with a bit of experience who want to know a bit more about the background. Of course all theory is backed by demoâ€™s.
