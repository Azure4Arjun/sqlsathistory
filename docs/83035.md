## Title: Orchestration and data movement with Azure Data Factory v2
## Abstract:
### As more and more businesses are looking to leverage cloud services to move and store their data we’ll take a look at how we can achieve that with ADF v2 and other Azure storage services.
For the SSIS developer, we’ll translate some ADF terminology to help get you started as well as demonstrate some real-life examples from our customer engagements.
And of course, being automation experts with Biml, we’ll demonstrate how we can automate the creation of ADF v2 assets.
