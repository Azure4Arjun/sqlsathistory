## Title: Customizable User Interfaces with Dynamic Components in Angular
## Abstract:
### Modern component-based design has brought developer productivity to new heights, but most are unaware that this pattern can be taken even further. Designers, admins, and users alike could all benefit from additional steps which make these components truly dynamic. New abilities can be unlocked, such as combining components to suit your need or personal preference, even faster development cycles, and lazy-loading components which have not yet been created. While this talk will focus on applying this technique in Angular, the concepts are universal and can be brought to any framework or language. Learn how making your components dynamic is surprisingly easy, and be left wondering why you have not done this sooner.
