## Title: Tabular vs Multidimensional.  Lets build it together!
## Abstract:
### This session will be one big demo where we will build both a Tabular and Multidimensional model side by side to contrast and compare the uses of both methods.  By the end of this session you should have a good understanding of both modeling methods and how to make use of them in the future.
