## Title: RAD with MDS
## Abstract:
### If you think about RAD tools, you think about Visual Studio LightSwitch, Project Sienna or even Power Apps. But usually you don't think about Microsoft SQL Server Master Data Services. 
MDS makes the administration and maintenance of your master data quite easy and comfortable. But in more and more projects, we no longer use MDS only as a master data system. Every time you need a small list, a maintainable table, something where somebody can store in any manner manageable information â€“ we use Master Data Services. 
From the simple management of SSIS jobs to a complex forecasting or annual planning system. With MDS you can create very quickly and easily applications for the processing of well-structured data. And together with the Excel AddIn directly for an environment with a high degree of acceptance. With SQL Server 2016, many more features have been added, to even more simplify the rapid application development process.
In this session, we will show different development approach
