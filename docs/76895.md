## Title: Kimball Methodology - Facts and dimensions
## Abstract:
### We will take a deep dive into the Kimball methodology for building a true star schema data store with fact and dimension tables. We will go into the types of facts tables and what you can do with the data. We will look at the granularity that you should and need to store for analytics at every possible level. There will be files available after the presentation of everything that we will cover.
