## Abstract:
### Too much data to think about and no idea where to start?  Let the machine to the thinking and give data mining a try!  This presentation looks into data mining: what it is, how to get it up and running, how to know if it makes any sense and (more importantly) how the use it.  We look at the development and evaluation of models and then put them to work so they can be used to produce tangible benefits for your end users.
