## Title: Combining SQL Server and R
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 now includes a feature called SQL Server R Services. This feature allows for direct integration between database and the R statistical language. In this session we'll look at some of the R and SQL integration features, then we will build a machine learning model and then use that model for scoring and predictive analytics.
