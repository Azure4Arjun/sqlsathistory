## Title: Azure Automation: Your SQL Agent in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### You want to migrate your on premise SQL Database to cloud, and soon recognize that SQL Agent is not available.  You heard the promise of spinning up databases on demand and turn off/dial down when not in use. Do you want to do this manually each time?  Azure Automation comes to rescue.  It is a service for simplifying cloud management. Using Azure Automation long-running, manual, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.
In this demo intensive session I will show you how to setup Azure Automation, walk you through a runbook example (a compilation of routine procedures and operations), execute runbook on demand and also show how to schedule the same.  At the end of this session you will have solid understanding about how to automate Azure services including replacing SQL Agent functionality using Azure automation, and conveniently encapsulate within the common Azure portal experience.
