## Title: Query Optimizer Deep Dive Pt1
## Abstract:
### Take your query writing and performance diagnostic skills to the next level by becoming familiar with the internals of the SQL Server query optimizer and the execution plans it produces.  This 400-level session covers deep optimizer internals and little-known query processor details that will give you new insights into the way SQL Server works behind the scenes.  Armed with this information, you will be better placed to write queries that optimize well, and to debug plan-related performance problems when they occur.
