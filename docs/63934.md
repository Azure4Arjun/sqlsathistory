## Title: Let’s have some fun(ctional) with M (Power Query/Power BI) language!
## Abstract:
### You know how to use Power BI or Power Query to load data from different sources but you want to go further than limiting yourself to the UI? You’re tired to look at auto-generated code and don’t understand the key concepts of this powerful ETL language? Then, this session is for you. During 60 minutes, you’ll learn how to write code in this functional language. Starting with syntax, primitive and structured values; we’ll quickly jump to the creation of expressions and functions and the usage of some recurrent patterns. This session contains many demos and real-life use-cases that you’ll be able to transpose to your own projects.
