## Title: Parallel Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### In this presentation we will discuss the Parallel Data Warehouse Technology from Microsoft in-depth. We will cover its main use cases, why it was built, and how PDW works. We will then talk about how we use Polybase and big-data technologies within PDW to access data stored in Hadoop. With the new Appliance Update release in 2014, we are now able to automatically create MapReduce code based on T-SQL. In this overview we will cover PDWâ€™s ability to implement Predicate Push-Down and show how we integrate with Hadoop natively.
