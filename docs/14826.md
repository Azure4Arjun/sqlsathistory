## Speaker: Greg Low
## Title: Better Together: Merge, Partitioning, ColumnStore 
## Abstract:
### Most SQL Server sessions are based around individual features but SQL Server really shines when you start to combine features. In this session, Greg will provide an introduction to ColumnStore indexes, review Table Partitioning and Merge and show how to combine these features to improve query performance while still being able to load data warehouse data quickly.
