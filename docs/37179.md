## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Automation with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### DBA’s are constantly faced with challenges in maintaining a healthy SQL Server environment. Monitoring our database servers, deploying database code changes and performing database restores are just a few examples of a day in the life of a DBA. As workloads increase, performing these tasks manually introduces more opportunity for human error and time starts to become your bottleneck. Your only option if you want to stay above water is to become more efficient at what you do. Enter, automation. 

Using PowerShell with the SQLPS module is a very potent combination for DBA’s looking to automate their database environment. This presentation will give you an overview of the PowerShell language itself, and then it will dive a bit deeper into the SQLPS module for SQL Server. Be it large or small, there are plenty of opportunities for leveraging PowerShell and SQLPS to help you automate your environment. 

The sooner you start to learn the better, because PowerShell is here to stay.
