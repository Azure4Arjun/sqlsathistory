## Title: UTF-8 in SQL Server 2019: Theory, implementation for Hebrew, and internals level behind the scene.
## Abstract:
### SQL Server started using Unicode with UCS-2 encoding (mapping range 0-65535, using 2 bytes). In time, support to UTF-16 added (mapping additional range up to 1114111, constructed from two UCS-2 Code Points using 4 bytes). Traditionally Unicode data types like NVARCHAR/NCHAR are marked with "National Character" N.

SQL Server 2019 introduced the Supplementary Character "_UTF8" to fully support UTF-8 under non-"National Character" Data types like CHAR/VARCHAR. UTF-8 potentially can reduce the data size dramatically up to 50%, but migrating to the new feature requires an in-depth understanding on how SQL Server store and use the data in order to prevent unwanted implications

In this presentation we will cover different string data types and Collations, supplementary characters and surrogate pairs, Code Pages, encoding (ASCII, Unicode, UCS-2, UTF-16, and UTF-8), Emoji, and more. We will dive into SQL Server internals and examine the way SQL Server store the data behind the scenes
