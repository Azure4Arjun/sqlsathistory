## Title: SQL 2012 AlwaysOn Quickstart
## Abstract:
### In this presentation I'll explain what the new SQL 2012 AlwaysOn high availability
and disaster recovery solution is all about.  I'll talk about the different levels
of protection it provides through Windows Clustering, SQL Clustering, and Availability

We'll finish with a dive into availability group configuration and the new
capabilities it gives us.
