## Speaker: Kevin Hazzard
## Title: From T4 to BimlScript
## Abstract:
### This session is for database and application developers who know Microsoft's T4  (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) from Visual Studio but would like to make the transition to the powerful BimlScript language for generating SSIS and SSAS projects dynamically. Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) and BimlScript let you tap into the rich metadata of your SQL Server databases, multiplying your efficiency and accuracy many times over. During this highly-interactive session, we'll leverage your familiarity with template-based code generators like T4, comparing its features to BimlScript to tackle some difficult Business Intelligence tasks in a fraction of the time it would normally take. If you don't know T4, any prior experience with template-based code generators will prepare you well for this session. Moreover, if you've never done dynamic code generation before, you may still find this session fascinating and a quite useful addition to your toolbox.
