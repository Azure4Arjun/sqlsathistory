## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2016 on Steroids!!
## Abstract:
### Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

# Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#647---Boston---BI-Edition-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
## Abstract:
### Being able to group data into logical and meaningful sets can be extremely useful.  When the data involved is a non-repeating sequence of integers, grouping is not too difficult.  Most real data, though, is made up of dates, times, decimals, and rarely can guarantee non-repeating, non-null data sets.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  Want to know how many production incidents make up a single common problem?  Can we track sales success by the number of  consecutive weeks that an agent has exceeded their goal?  How about the longest home run streak hit by Derek Jeter at night games on Tuesdays?

Discussion will include performance, CTEs, recursion, set-based vs. iterative analysis, and some pretty hairy TSQL!

# Relationship Modeling Patterns in SSAS and Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#647---Boston---BI-Edition-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Brett Powell
## Title: Relationship Modeling Patterns in SSAS and Power BI
## Abstract:
### The relationships defined in Power BI and SSAS Tabular data models directly impact both the filter context and the performance of queries. This session will briefly review the fundamentals of relationships in Power BI and SSAS Tabular models including filter propagation in classic one-to-many star schema relationships. The majority of the session, however, will cover the features and design patterns available to handle common but more complex modeling scenarios such as many-to-many, multiple granularities, counting values from dimension tables, and implementing 'virtual relationships' via DAX when physical relationships can't be created in the model. 

Example models will be shared using single and bidirectional relationships as well as relationship functions such as CROSSFILTER(), USERELATIONSHIP(), and TREATAS(). Recommended practices for choosing and implementing the alternative modeling techniques will be shared along with relationship pitfalls to avoid.

# Azure Data Catalog – Turning Unused Assets into Usable Knowledge
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#647---Boston---BI-Edition-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Melody Zacharias
## Title: Azure Data Catalog – Turning Unused Assets into Usable Knowledge
## Abstract:
### Data is today’s currency. Azure Data Catalog (ADC) is a relatively unknown resource in the IT community.  This is an unfortunate state since ADC is an incredibly useful tool that is easy to implement and use. Companies that are able to leverage their data have seen the greatest gains in growth and market capitalization.  The reason for this is simple: We live in the information age.  Being able to leverage the data you gather is the invitation you need just to compete in information age.
ADC is an indispensable tool that helps companies organize and make sense of the mountains of data they collect every day.  By walking participants through an implementation of ADC, I will introduce them to the product, and show how easy it is to use.  By presenting concrete examples of how ADC is used, I will demonstrate its importance. Participants should leave this session determined to introduce ADC to their team and resolute in their intention to implement it within their company.

Come to this highly interactive session to learn why 99% of the candidates failed the simplest questions and disqualified them self.

Thomas will share what he misses in resumes and how to respond to questions better.

## Speaker: Jack Corbett
## Title: It's All about the Rules: A Dynamic ETL Architecture
## Abstract:
### You are provided with requirements for an ETL Process that has hundreds of rules that need to be applied and you code them all and during testing some rules change and more are added requiring you to modify SSIS packages taking hours of your time and there is no simple method to isolate testing the changed and new rules costing even more time.  In this session we will go over how we addressed this situation with a rules-based architecture, where rules are defined in a database and read and executed from SSIS.
