## Title: Migrating a Disk-based Table to a Memory-optimized Table
## Abstract:
### In-Memory OLTP table was first introduced in SQL Server 2014. However, a massive number of limitations makes In-Memory OLTP table usage practically impossible. In SQL Server 2016 many of those limitations were eliminated which made it possible to start implementing In-Memory OLTP table in the database. The session 'Migrating a Disk-based Table to a Memory-optimized Table' will cover the process of migrating the disk tables to In-Memory OLTP table. This process is not straight forward and requires analysis before making a final decision for migration. However, the benefits of In-Memory OLTP table is worth the effort. If you are looking to improve transaction speed and reduce blocking for your server, the In-Memory OLTP tables is an excellent way to accomplish this task.
