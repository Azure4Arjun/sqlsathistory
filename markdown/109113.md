## Title: Building a Security Dashboard for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### If you have a SQL Server, you need to secure it. However, even the most robust security is useless if you're not monitoring it. How else would you know whether something has changed? Or whether something isn't working as expected? And frankly, for monitoring, you need a quick view of the data you've collected. Enter dashboards.

In this session, we'll discuss what information you need to collect from your SQL Servers to effectively monitor security. You'll also see how to build a simple security dashboard for your own use using Power BI.
