## Title: DBCC WritePage and Data Recovery
## Abstract:
### DBCC WritePage is an undocumented command that allows users to modify physical pages directly. It can only be useful for database repairing when there are extreme situations where nothing can help you recover your data. It makes troubles in most of the time. But it's a good tool for learning other stuff. More importantly, you need to know this when others have already known.

In this 500 level session, We will explore some internals, use this command or other ways to break the database integrity, and use this tool to recover it. I will also demonstrate you how to keep yourself safe from using this command.
