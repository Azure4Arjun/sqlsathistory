# Azure Machine Learning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Nico Jacobs
## Title: Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning plays a central role in Cortana Intelligence: discovering useful patterns in all the collected data is essential in advanced analytics.
To get started with Azure machine learning you don't need to be  an expert: Microsoft provides ready made models that can be used immediately (Cognitive Services). For other business problems (e.g. churn) Microsoft provides a template, but we need to tune this template to our business data. And for some analysis problems we need to build machine learning solutions from scratch.
In this demo-oriented session you will see demonstrations of these three ways of working with Machine Learning in the Azure cloud.

# Abusing your SQL Server for fun and profit
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Abusing your SQL Server for fun and profit
## Abstract:
### SQL and SQL Server has a lot in common with Othello - fairly easy to learn, but takes a lifetime to master. Many times overt abuse is not even necessary - an incorrectly configured database is surprisingly capable of destroying any semblance of performance all by itself. 
The database is very good at doing some things - and exceptionally bad at others. Combine these facts with a general lack of understanding of the database engine and the road to perfomance hell is truly plotted. 
Join Alexander for a session of examples how developers can and do abuse SQL Server - both intentionally and unintentionally.

# Always On Multi-Site Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Always On Multi-Site Patterns
## Abstract:
### Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.

## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: Management Studio level-up
## Abstract:
### Move up to Management Studio Superstar with these great productivity tips! We’ll explore stuff like keyboard shortcuts, configuration options, how to keep your SSMS settings synchronized across multiple environments and other really useful everyday tricks and hacks. Think “hey, wait, how’d you do that!?”

Some of the things I’ll cover:

* Previewing and quick-reference stuff you can do with keyboard shortcuts
* Quickly navigating your code to find errors or bookmarks

No undocumented stuff, no registry editor, and nothing you wouldn’t put into production. Just really clever productivity tips that will take some of the burden off your everyday work.

But I’m not going to sugarcoat it. Your code may still run slow, and you’ll probably write just as many bugs – but you’ll write them a lot quicker and with so much more style and panache.

## Speaker: André Melancia
## Title: Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.

# When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.

# Power BI behind the scene: security and user management
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: Power BI behind the scene: security and user management
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a great suite of tools for business analytics and reporting. You use it to create reports and dashboard to deliver insights throughout your company. 
But, what about the new licensing model recently introduced for Power BI? How it can fits to your needs?
Every organization is a complex system with rules and limitations. Users belong to groups each with visibility profile. 
So you need to know how security in Power BI works: how to configure and restrict access, how to filter data based on the logged user, how to implement static and dynamic Row-level security (RLS), how to control usage of specific features. 

Furthermore you deal with a large number of users you can’t leverage by hand. Power BI provides an admin portal that allows you to manage users and groups in the Office 365 admin center. 
Come to this session to discover what’s behind the scenes in Power BI and how to implement a solution compliant to your security and governance model.

# Green is good, Red is bad - Turning your Checklists into Pester Tests
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rob Sewell
## Title: Green is good, Red is bad - Turning your Checklists into Pester Tests
## Abstract:
### This session is for DBAs specifically, but will be relevant to any technicians who use checklists

I was required to prove that I had successfully installed and configured a backup solution across a large estate. I had a number of success criteria that had to be met. Checking all of these by hand (eye) would have been error prone, so I wrote a test to do this for me and an easy for management to read HTML report using PowerShell and Pester.

The session has come from that situation and is about enabling you to provide an easy to read output to quickly and repeatedly show that infrastructure is as expected for a set of checks, also known as  Operational Validation using Pester. There are many use cases for this type of solution; DR testing, installation, first line checks, presentation setups

After this session you will have a basic understanding of how Pester works and the capability to examine your checklists and create your own validation tests and provide some reporting for manager

# Change Tracking: A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-657)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: Change Tracking: A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control
## Abstract:
### Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture. Change Tracking is now the red-headed step child, but in many cases may be the best solution for data ETL movement from an SQL Server OLTP database to a data warehouse or reporting database. This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos. It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos using TSQL only (no SSIS).

## Speaker: Emanuele Zanchettin
## Title: JSON before and after SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### The JavaScript Object Notation format, known simply as JSON, has now become a standard in data interchange between client-server applications, it is also used to store information in non-relational databases and the SQL Server 2016 engine handles it natively . However, today, not everyone has passed to the latest version of SQL Server, however, it is possible to process the JSON format even with earlier versions: in this session, it is confident with this format and illustrates the non-native mode that allows you to be ready in the moment of the upgrade to 2016 (or later) with a few simple moves. Finally, with a few simple examples, you will find some tips on how to use JSON in an advanced way with SQL Server 2016.
