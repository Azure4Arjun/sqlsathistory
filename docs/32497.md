## Title: DW-ETL: 10 Mistakes to Avoid
## Abstract:
### With data being the focal point of a data warehouse, its data integration component becomes a critical point of failure of the whole system, and to make matters worse, we, as developers, face increasingly complex scenarios and requirements such as larger number of systems and volumes of data, data quality problems and complex business logic.
 
In this session Rafael will share a compilation of pitfalls and mistakes he has seen –and made!– across many implementations, and offers recommendations to avoid them. We will look at problems related to metadata, data quality, monitoring, system reliability and some SSIS specific issues among other common problems.
