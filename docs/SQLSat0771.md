# Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-771)
Event Date: 07-07-2018 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Hamish Watson
## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
## Abstract:
### Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

# DAX as a Query Language
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-771)
Event Date: 07-07-2018 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Matt Allington
## Title: DAX as a Query Language
## Abstract:
### Many people (business and IT) already use Power Pivot, Power BI and SSAS Tabular to produce reporting and analytics tools.  But did you know that these tools also have their own query language?   In traditional databases such as SQL server, it is possible to extract data into a new table.  The same is possible using DAX as a query language with a tabular data model.

In this session, Matt will introduce the topic and show how you can use DAX Studio to connect to a data model.  Once connected, DAX studio can be used to write queries over the tabular data model to start to interrogate the data itself (as opposed to simply aggregating the values into a pivot table or a Power BI report).  The learning can then be used to write more complex DAX measures or alternatively it can be used to extract tabular data directly into a table for further analysis.

## Speaker: Gilbert Quevauvilliers
## Title: Power BI Writeback with Power Apps
## Abstract:
### Have your users ever asked if it is possible to update a record in a report, and see the results almost immediately?

In this session I will demonstrate how to integrate write back using Power Apps, within a Power BI report.

The session will be almost entirely demo based, in which I will demonstrate how to integrate the Power App with the Power BI report. And then show by updating a record, that the data is almost instantly updated within the Power BI report.

# The Why and How of Partitioned Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-771)
Event Date: 07-07-2018 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Martin Cairney
## Title: The Why and How of Partitioned Tables
## Abstract:
### Previously restricted to Enterprise Edition, partitioning was one of the features pushed down to all Editions in SQL 2016 SP1. With greater availability comes greater responsibility to make sure it is implemented appropriately.
This session will demonstrate some of the common pitfalls with implementing partitioning:
•	how excessive data movement can kill performance
•	how poor maintenance can negate the performance gains
We’ll then look at how to plan and implement partitioning appropriately and some of the corresponding benefits that can be realised from a well implemented and managed partition scheme:
•	how to automatically maintain a partition scheme
•	how to implement a sliding window for data loading and archiving
•	how to plan and implement partitioning to limit data movement
Finally, we will consider the additional options open to us with partitioned tables from both the maintenance perspective, and the coding and tuning perspective.

## Title: Azure Data Lake Analytics: Leveraging the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### What you feared has come upon you: You’ve been happily building business intelligence solutions the traditional way for years; Finally, the big data curse has caught up with you. Your organization wants to exploit their big data along with their day-to-day transactional data. You are now tasked with storing all this in one place and working your analytics magic on it. You start wondering how and where you would store this data, what kind of hardware you would need and and how you would learn everything from storing to processing to analysis in a short time – after all big data is a different type of beast from transactional data.
Fear not, all you need to do is look to the heavens; with Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Lake Analytics, you could get started quite fast. After an introduction to Azure Data Lake, we will dive into how you could perform simple yet power analytics using methods that are familiar with Azure Data Lake Analytics.

Event Date: 07-07-2018 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Victor Isakov
## Title: Mastering Temporary Objects
## Abstract:
### More and more Transact-SQL code is using temporary tables and table variables constructs. These constructs leverage the tempdb system database, which in turn becomes a severe performance bottleneck. This will be particularly "felt" when moving on-premise database solutions into the cloud. In this session we will cover the best practices in how you should be implementing these temporary constructs in your database solutions. We will discuss the differences between temporary tables and table variables, their impact on query performance and tempdb before looking a different implementations and best practices. We will examine a variety of techniques to improve temporary object performance, from hardware to the database engine configuration. Finally we will cover a number of key, proven techniques that can improve substantially performance. With lots of examples and case studies we will show how you can improve query performance by 20x or more.
