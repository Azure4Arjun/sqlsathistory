## Title: Data Wrangling for Reporting  Analytics using Power BI
## Abstract:
### In todayâ€™s world reporting and analytics are no longer focused exclusively on internal data from transactional systems and the data warehouse. 
Mashups using data from partners, commercial and public sources are fast becoming the new normal.
Do you have a csv file too big to open, is a non-windows format or generates errors on import or opening?
Need to determine the quality of a file downloaded from the internet or supplied by another party?
In this presentation we will review tools to examine/repair schema issues and explore Power BI Desktop features that provide insights into your datasets along with the M language for building mashups and data models.
