## Title: SQL Server Data Tools: Write it, test it, deploy it with Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is the latest iteration of technology that makes use of Visual Studio for coding, testing, and deploying databases.  SSDT provides a single solution, whether you choose to deploy your code to your own computer, to a nearby server, or to an Azure cloud database.  I'll talk about my recent "real world experiences" with this technology -- where SSDT really helped and where it ...didn't.   There will be more time for QA, so that you can better understand if this technology is right for your  projects.
