## Title: Common Data Model, nice to meet you
## Abstract:
### “Data is the new oil” we heard it a lot of times. As IT professionals it’s very important to manage this fuel across our organizations, in order to properly feed “engines” in the hands of data analysts and data scientists.
Without being able to share and understand the same data easily, each application or data integration project requires a custom implementation, which can be expensive and potentially risky from a business users point of view.
Here is where the Common Data Model (CDM) comes in: we will understand CDM underlying concepts and try some hands-on integration with Microsoft Power Platform and Azure data services.
