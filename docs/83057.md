## Title: Virtualisation and DevOps can help make your SQL Server perform!!
## Abstract:
### Over the years, running SQL Server inside a virtual machine has changed from being a bit of a strange and risky idea to being commonplace and offering a range of benefits: more effective distribution of load, more flexible provisioning, and allowing additional tiers of redundancy to be put in place.

Though these factors are compelling, running your database inside a virtual machine introduces an additional set of variables to worry about. 

This session will discuss industry tools that allows for configuration and optimisation of virtual servers. 

It will also show how using common DevOps principles - such as automation, monitoring and Infrastructure as Code can mitigate some of the variability in running SQL Server on a virtual host.

We'll also go over some of the things that you should be looking at within your virtual environment to ensure that you are getting the best performance out of it.
