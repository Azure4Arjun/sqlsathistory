## Title: Using LINQ to SQL in Your Applications 
## Abstract:
### LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful new technology built into the Microsoft.NET 3.5 platform that allows developers to query object graphs (including DataSets, XML and SQL Server databases) with a familiar and easy-to-use query syntax right from their application code. Learn how to setup a LINQ project, retrieve strongly-typed object graphs from SQL Server (including child relationships and object dependencies) and bind this data to an ASP.Net webpage, a Windows Form or a Silverlight/WPF application.
