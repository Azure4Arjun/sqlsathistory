## Title: Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### One of a DBA#39;s primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring. Although it#39;s one of the newer tools in the DBA toolbox, Extended Events is one of the most powerful tools available. In this session, we will discuss performance management responsibilities for DBAs and provide a foundation, through Extended Events, to understand and resolve performance issues.
