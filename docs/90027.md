## Title: Fundamentals of Building an Effective Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Building a data warehouse that is effective and efficient is a constant challenge to designers and developers, and this session will highlight some of the fundamental guidelines to use during the life cycle of a data warehouse. With a broad range of topics, both business reporting users and developers  architects will find this session informative.  We will review the importance of each phase of the lifecycle, including analysis, design, development, testing and maintenance. We will discuss the expected outcomes for each phase, as well as the stakeholders who should be involved in the decision making process along the way. We will provide examples of documentation to help guide each step and discuss issues that commonly arise when building a Data Warehouse. At the conclusion of the session, attendees will receive a Data Warehouse checklist that provides a comprehensive overview of everything discussed and can serve as a resource beyond the session.
