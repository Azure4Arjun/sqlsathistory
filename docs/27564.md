## Title: AlwaysOn – Way to get your 9’s?
## Abstract:
### We are always being told 9’s, 9’s  and more 9’s, but when implementation time comes to take action, technology / budget limitations get in the way, especially in the High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) technology space.  Clustering and Mirroring are great and meet many of our needs, but there are some things we have wished for, such as a mirror database that is usable. AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both Mirroring and Multi-Node Multi-Subnet Clustering (True Geo-Clustering Support!!!).  AlwaysOn also allows the replica database to be used in a Read-Only capacity, so we can use it for reporting purposes. (Imagine that!)  Join us in providing a warm welcome to this new functionality with extensive demos.
