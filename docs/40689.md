## Title: Keeping Your SQL Under Control: Version Controlling Your Database
## Abstract:
### Source control isn't just for application development anymore; your database code needs it just as much!
 
This session will cover the fundamentals of source control systems and how getting your database under version control is an excellent way to collaborate with team members, communicate changes, and keep an audit trail. You'll see how Redgate SQL Source Control makes it incredibly easy and intuitive to maintain your database in nearly any source control system, and how the universe of development pipelines and continuous integration is easily accessible from there.
