## Speaker: Bradley Schacht
## Title: Intro to Cloud ETL: Azure Data Factory V2
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory (ADF) has long been a service that confused the masses. With pipelines, data sets, availability schedules, and JSON littering the code based environment it was no wonder the learning curve was steep. With the introduction of Azure Data Factory Version 2 that has all changed. The environment is simplified, scheduling is easily understood, pipelines are more straightforward, and there is more functionality now than ever before. Data Factory now feels like a true cloud-born ETL tool for everyone who is already familiar with SSIS. As a bonus, the lift-and-shift story has never been easier as SSIS packages can now be run natively in ADF. 

 In this session, Brad will walk through the major features including creating the environment, authoring your first pipeline, scheduling, monitoring, deploying SSIS packages, and interacting with on-prem data sets. At the end of this session, you will be ready to orchestrate data movement with Azure Data Factory like a pro!
