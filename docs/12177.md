## Title: Tuning SQL Server for SharePoint
## Abstract:
### We will discuss SQL and SharePoint integration concepts, walk through the different types of SharePoint databases, and get you more comfortable with the SharePoint platform.
Some of the topics covered will include: the configuration steps and settings needed for SQL Server to properly host SharePoint databases, database size considerations, the SQL permissions your SharePoint administrators REALLY need, and why SharePoint databases have a GUID in their name (and how to avoid them!).
