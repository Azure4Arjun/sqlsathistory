## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Tune Like a Guru - The Big Three! (Hands On)
## Abstract:
### EVERY client I engage with is taught to RUN 3 SCRIPTS IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT THOUGHT AND WITHOUT DELAY as soon as a performance problem is noted. I am exceptionally good at performance tuning and forensics, but I (nor anyone else out there) cannot get at the root cause of a problem without information about the occurrence. These scripts will give you said information, which is very often transient in nature! I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this! :-D

Es una sesión con algunas demos prácticas que, aunque no es obligatorio, si que necesitarás un portatil si quieres ponerte manos en la masa. ¡No te lo olvides en casa!
