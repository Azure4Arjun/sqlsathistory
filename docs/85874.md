## Title: SentryOne Tools for Productivity and Performance
## Abstract:
### Whether you are hosting in your office, in a data center, or in the cloud, SentryOne covers monitoring, alerting, and tuning to help you get the most out of your servers – including servers that aren’t running SQL Server. In this session, your hosts will guide you through time saving strategies for managing performance across hybrid environments - whether you are running physical or virtual servers, SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, APS, or Azure SQL Data Warehouse. You will see demonstrations of SentryOne software highlighting configuration and performance pitfalls and leave with a better understanding of performance problems you may be currently missing. SentryOne provides a unified management experience; it’s your ONE platform for physical, virtual, and cloud performance.
