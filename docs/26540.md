## Abstract:
### In my presentation “Practical BI: Strategies IT Can Use To Maximize Its Productivity and Value To The Business”, I will review strategies that the BI technical team is using at Valpak to provide the best service to our business stakeholders. In particular, I will discuss the ‘agile development’ methodology we are employing, and will detail the special refinements we’ve made to accommodate the unique challenges of BI development. I will also describe specific practices to facilitate productivity that can be employed in any BI shop regardless of project management.
