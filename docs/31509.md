## Speaker: Kendra Little
## Title: Seven Strategic Discussions About Scale
## Abstract:
### Know those apps that need a complete rewrite from scratch, but management won't listen to you?  Kendra Little has been there and she's figured out how to frame the big conversations. She'll give you seven strategies to improve scale and change application architecture, and explain concepts from sharding to caching along the way. You'll get a toolkit for each conversation: how to gather the right supporting data from the environment, who to talk to, and how to speak the right language to drive each change.
