## Title: R; One Ring to Rule Them All
## Abstract:
### R is one of the most popular and powerful analytics languages. That helps data scientists to prepare data, predict data, and visualize it. Microsoft offers several deployment options to bring next-generation advanced analytics to your business. Microsoft R Server delivers R-based analytics to where your data lives. Processing analytics in-place eliminates data movement, reducing latencies and operational costs. 
In this session, first basic concepts of machine learning will be discussed. Then, a demo of how to use R for data wrangling, and visualization (show map) in R studio will present. Then I will show how R can be helpful for software developers to create a intelligence software using R in visual studio and  Azure ML API in c# codes. Finally a couple of demos will be presented on how R can help BI developers and database administrators using  R server ,R in SQL Server 2016, and power BI to create smart reports.
