## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: SSIS Frameworks and Biml
## Abstract:
### The material in this session ranges from introductory to advanced. 

Building small, function-like SSIS packages is an SSIS best practice. Biml helps generate lots of packages using design patterns. 

Now you have a bunch of packages - how do you manage executing them? An SSIS Framework can execute packages in a specified order, and it is driven by metadata. Need to make a change in execution order? Execute a T-SQL statement. 

How do you manage the metadata that drives an SSIS Framework? Biml can generate the metadata, as well.

Join SSIS author, blogger, and presenter Andy Leonard for this demo-packed session on Data Integration Lifecycle Management (DILM).
