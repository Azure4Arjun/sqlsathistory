## Title: Women in Technology: Identifying, Understanding and Combating Gen
## Abstract:
### Gender Bias is something we're all guilty of.  It's typically unconscious and often stems from long held misperceptions about women  job responsibilities.  We'll learn about the origins of some of these biases and how to identify gender bias when we see it.  We'll discuss some strategies for how  both men and women can combat this at work  in our every day lives.  This session is about developing positive solutions to a problem that often goes undiscussed.
