## Title: Parallel Processing Database Architecture
## Abstract:
### If you want to architect a parallel processing system, Data Vault should be your preferred architecture.  In this session I will introduce you to the Data Vault design pattern and demonstrate the major performance advantages of this architecture.  Data Vault hub, link and satellite tables allow for vertical and horizontal partitioning of data.  When properly implemented, your database tables will provide the most index coverage of any indexing system and provide the fastest possible disk scan access.  I will provide a real world example of a parallel manufacturing execution system that we developed at Abound Solar which implements the Data Vault architecture.
