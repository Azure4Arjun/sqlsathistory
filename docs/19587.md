## Title: Accelerate SQL data and applications over the WAN
## Abstract:
### The main culprit affecting MS-SQL performance over a WAN is latency.  Latency cannot be addressed by adding bandwidth.  A different solution is needed.  Riverbed Steelhead appliances address latency issues with MS-SQL by pipelining the delivery of data between the client and the SQL server, giving up to a 10x improvement in performance.
