Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 2. Dorian Gray
## Speaker: Carmel Gunn
## Title: First steps in continuous integration for databases with Red Gate’s SQL Automation Pack.
## Abstract:
### At previous SQL Saturday Dublin events, you’ve seen how easy it is to get your SQL Server databases in source control.
In this session, we’ll build on this foundation and look at the resources you can use to set up an automated build process for your databases.
Starting with a database that’s source controlled using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control, we’ll use the SQL Automation Pack and Team City to set up a simple build process that runs every time you commit a change.
You’ll see how this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker, and how you can use it to produce an artefact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future.
One lucky session attendee will also win a license of the SQL Automation Pack during this session, so don’t miss out!
