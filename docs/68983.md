## Title: R Server on Spark - Go big or go home
## Abstract:
### The publication of R Server by Microsoft aims to improve the weaknesses of the R language and its processes of performance, development and operationalization. When we need to analyze very diverse or really large amounts of data, traditional servers may fall short, and this is where R Server over Spark comes to the rescue. How is it implemented in the Microsoft ecosystem? In what scenarios does it help us? How do we configure it? In this session we will answer all these questions and more, with our eyes always on the clouds and thinking big.
