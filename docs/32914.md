## Title: Building SMO Apps for the Non-Programmer DBA
## Abstract:
### SMO gives us an exremely powerful library that can be used to perform a slew of SQL Server tasks.  Using this library we can build tools to automate daily tasks and even build apps that might not be easy to do or even possible with SSMS/TSQL.  In this session I will teach you, the non-programmer DBA, how to build an SMO application that performs some SQL Server health checks and reports back to you in a nice GUI tool.  We will go over some basic OOP information but the bulk of this session will be hands on building/demoing. No .NET experience is required. The less experience you have with .NET development the better!!
