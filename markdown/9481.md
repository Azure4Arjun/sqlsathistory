## Speaker: Andrew Brust
## Title: Big Data-BI Fusion: Microsoft HDInsight  MS BI
## Abstract:
### HDInsight is the name of Microsoft’s distribution of Apache Hadoop, the essential and defining technology of the Big Data world. But why in the world would Microsoft embrace an open source technology, written in Java, and customarily run on clusters of Linux servers? Two words: Business Intelligence. HDInsight (and Hadoop in general) become far more enterprise-friendly when combined with Microsoft BI technologies like PowerPivot, Analysis Services and Power View. And then there’s SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse, which actually blends the BI and Big Data worlds together in one product. In this session, Microsoft BI expert and ZDNet Big Data blogger Andrew Brust will introduce you to HDInsight and its developer tools, demonstrate relevant BI tools and show how they work together. He’ll also show how developers with relational database skills can make the jump into this exciting and opportunity-filled area.
