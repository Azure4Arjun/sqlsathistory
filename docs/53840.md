## Title: Building an SQL Server 2016 AlwaysON Availability Solution (Part 2)
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 has major enhancements to existing features as well as brand new ones that will contribute to making SQL Server implementations more highly available. 
This two-part session will cover not only what is in SQL Server 2016, such as all of the improvements to availability groups like seeding and basic AGs, but important Windows Server 2016 features like site awareness, storage replica, and more that all DBAs should be aware of. With this extended session, most of what will be discussed will be shown so you can see how they work. The session is based on practical scenarios from a customerâ€™s implementation. We will start with requirements list and will end up with an implemented solution.
