## Title: Hyper-V for SQL Server Virtualization
## Abstract:
### VMware is not the only game in town when it comes to virtualizing SQL Server in a production environment. Microsoftâ€™s Hyper-V, which is built into Windows, is a viable and powerful option to consider when going down the path of virtualization. Microsoft currently has a few advantages over VMware, such as being able to use high speed networks and storage solutions to have blazingly fast deployments. This session will discuss Hyper-V from a SQL Server point of view based on real world deployments and architectures, providing tips and tricks along the way, and introduce you to new technologies and features you may not have heard of such as Scale Out File Server and RDMA. Whether you are a VMware shop that is looking to reduce cost by switching platforms, or just want to know how Hyper-V stacks up, this session has you covered.
