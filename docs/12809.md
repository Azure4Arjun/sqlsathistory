## Title: Turbo Charged SQL Development With SQL#
## Abstract:
### Turbo charge your SQL Server development with the amazing SQL# CLR library.  We will do a quick overview of the SQL# library and then jump into examining a few real world implementations of some of the functions and procedures. Some examples will include string manipulation, file handling, as well as some RegEx usage. There are over 245 procedures and functions, user defined aggregates, and user defined types ... and counting. Come explore some of the interesting problems that SQL# can solve. If you'd like to download and view the CLR library ahead of the presentation, you can get most of the CLR features for free at www.sqlsharp.com.
