# SQLSaturday #7 - Birmingham 2009
Event Date: 30-05-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Development
## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: Confessions of a Data Integrator
## Abstract:
### Most database professionals are charged with managing, extracting, and integrating data from sources which were not designed by themselves.  This session focuses on methods of dealing with "somebody else's" design choices, including a focus on dynamic SQL, datetime concerns, and data abstraction.  This should be an interactive session, so feel free to bring your horror stories as well as your ideas for success!
