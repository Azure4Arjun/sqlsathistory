## Title: Clusters! From the ground up, let's build one together
## Abstract:
### You're looking to protect your SQL instance from a machine failure.  Or maybe your storage budget and tight and you don't want to have your databases in two places with one of the other highly available options that SQL provides.  Let's learn what a cluster is and why it might be the right thing for you.  We'll explore the system, network, storage and database administration sides of the equation.  And, when it's all said and done we'll even have built a SQL clustered instance!
