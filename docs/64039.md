## Title: SQL Server AGs and Clustering In The Cloud
## Abstract:
### This session is to help you see how straight forward it is to create a test environment in AWS and Azure utilizing the features provided by Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC).  We will create both an instance level Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) and a 2014 Availability Group (AG) with a read-only replica node.   We will show how to setup IPs, iSCSI devices, default AD setup, and SQL Server installations.  Some basic Powershell will be used and the code made available if needed.

iSCSI will be created using a 'Storage Gateway' on AWS and another solution such as DataKeeper for Microsoft Azure.

Ultimately these environments will allow you to quickly spin up machines and begin to look at State Configuration solutions such as 'Microsoft DSC' or for example, utilizing the SALT stack.
