## Title: Azure SQL DWH, from ingesting the data to providing analysis
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DWH, from ingesting the data to providing analysis
Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a massively parallel processing (MPP) cloud-based, scale-out, relational database capable of processing massive volumes of data. It combines the power of Data Analysis appliance with the flexibility in resources of the cloud. 
Who should use it, Who shouldn’t and Who is already using it?
Transfer your data in from your own in-house systems and enrich your data with external sources from the public domain or cloud source and how about non-relational data. 
But what if we already have too much data and what we need is an Analytically processed and distilled information? How can we get intelligent decision based on all that data that we collected in our SQL Data warehouse?
All these and other related questions we’ll try to explore together… See you there.
