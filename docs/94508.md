## Title: Building a modern data warehouse
## Abstract:
### Embarking on building a modern data warehouse in the cloud can be an overwhelming experience due to the sheer number of products that can be used, especially when the use cases for many products overlap others. In this talk I will cover the use cases of many of the Microsoft products that you can use when building a modern data warehouse, broken down into four areas: ingest, store, prep, and model  serve. Itâ€™s a complicated story that I will try to simplify, giving blunt opinions of when to use what products and the pros/cons of each.
