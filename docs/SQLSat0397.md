# Whatcha Doin'? Passive Security for Hostile Environments
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Security
## Speaker: Bob Pusateri
## Title: Whatcha Doin'? Passive Security for Hostile Environments
## Abstract:
### Ideal database security settings usually exist in books, but rarely in reality. Is your CIO a member of the sysadmin role because they demanded it? Or maybe some users have rights for purely political reasons? Just because you can't enforce security through typical means doesn't mean you're powerless. Attend this session to learn about the features SQL Server provides that will allow you to keep track of what your users are up to at all times and sleep a little easier. Through various scenarios and demos, see how technologies such as event notifications, auditing, and extended events can help ensure nothing happens on your system without you knowing about it. Even in optimally secured environments these techniques can still come in handy. The best security is often that which cannot be seen.

Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Eric Zierdt
## Title: Table Partitions for Archiving
## Abstract:
### What is Table Partitioning?  How can it be used to move large amounts of data quickly?  How can it be used with a data archiving strategy to quickly and easily drop archived data from a table?  We will discuss the practical applications of table partitioning using scripts to generate new table partitions, move a partition to another table and discussion on how this can benefit you.

# What is causing my database to grow?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jared Karney
## Title: What is causing my database to grow?
## Abstract:
### Have you ever received a call that an application is throwing errors about the database being out of space? This session will help you learn how to proactively deal with those calls! Sometimes it isn’t practical to limit the growth of our databases.  As DBAs, it is our responsibility to make sure that we know the disk space that is used and free, the size of our databases, when they grew, and why they grew so that we can prepare for it or reduce it. We can also track the size and growth over time to be able to predict future trends. In this beginner session, Jared Karney will show you how you can track the size of your disks, databases, and database files using DMVs. He will show you how to structure tables and indexes for storing this data, demonstrate the Extended Events to track when a data or log file grows and what caused the growth to occur, and how you can automate the whole process using SQL Agent.

# APPLY Yourself
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

# Performing a SQL Server Health Check
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Performing a SQL Server Health Check
## Abstract:
### How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  If you say never, I'm not surprised - many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have many gaping holes.  It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that have too much!)

Come learn how to use freely available tools to check your servers for basic issues like backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy and indexing.  If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

# Establishing a SLA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Soft Skills
## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Establishing a SLA
## Abstract:
### Most DBA's rarely establish Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the Management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point something goes really wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
#160;
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA.

# Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Security
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel
## Abstract:
### Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

# Scary Things A Database Owner Can Do
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#397---Omaha-2015)
Event Date: 15-08-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Security
## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: Scary Things A Database Owner Can Do
## Abstract:
### So you've setup your new SQL Server instance and it’s time to start adding databases to it.  You followed security best practices at the instance level, but what about security within each database?  Is that something you can control?  Well, if like me, you work in a shop that mostly purchases software, then having users with database owner permissions is a reality, and likely not one you can change.  But members of the db_owner role can only make changes that would adversely impact their own databases, right?  Think again. During this session we’ll review some common database level settings and actions which can have a negative impact across the entire instance.  We’ll discuss ways to mitigate these risks and monitor for their occurrence.  Come learn how to not let poor choices made by a database owner impact your entire instance.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Database: The Elephant in the ALM Room
## Abstract:
### Many teams and individuals are still building their databases and maintaining them through old-fashioned manual processes. This, even as these same teams move towards an automated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) through the adoption of DevOps best practices. These manual processes are hurting the ability of your database deployments to keep up with modern development. Is there a technical reason for this slow adoption of ALM best practices in the database world, or is there a cultural problem preventing a reassessment of these manual processes? Or, could it be both? This session will address these questions as it explores the challenges presented by ALM for databases. We will discuss the necessary first steps required to move from a manual database deployment process to a fully automated one. You will learn about tooling that can assist you in implementing these new processes. Your database deployments can take advantage of the same processes you use for application deployments.
