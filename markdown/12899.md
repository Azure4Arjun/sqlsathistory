## Title: Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data
## Abstract:
### Writing map-reduce jobs to process data is not a trivial experience. To do this effectively you really need to be a seasoned java or C# programmer. Even then it is a time consuming experience. A very useful tool available to create and run Map-reduce jobs in Hadoop is Hive. HiveQL is a declarative language modeled to provide a similar experience as writing SQL. If you are familiar with SQL the use of HiveQL should be very intuitive. With HiveQL you construct and run the statement, submitting it to a query engine. The query engine transforms the query into a series of map-reduce jobs. By not having to worry about the low level coding you become much more productive and can concentrate on data analysis. This session is designed to get you up to speed and productive with hive. It includes several practical examples in order to make data analysis with hive as concrete as possible.
