## Title: Centralized SSIS
## Abstract:
### Store SSIS on one SQL Server in a centrally managed location. Easily scale resources to handle SSIS execution, keep the ETL workload away from other databases, and standardize multiple SQL instances using the same SSIS package without opening Visual Studio. Review logs in one centralized location. Centralized SSIS is available in version SQL Server 2012 and later.
