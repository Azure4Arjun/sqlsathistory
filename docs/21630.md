## Title: Keep your sanity by using Policy Based Management to implement standards
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review the basics of Policy Based Management, what you get out of the box and how you can build policies that extend beyond the built in facets. We will take a look at some advanced policies using WMI to get OS configuration information such as Power Configuration and TSQL to read configuration information such as the last time CheckDB was run for a database.
