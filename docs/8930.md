## Title: Configuring Security in SharePoint for SQL BI
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SharePoint Server is a fantastic option to surface SQL Server Business Intelligence tools to end users (SSRS, PowerVIew and PowerPivot, SQL Tabular, SQL BISM).

Yet, this tends to be a little tricky because the SQL Server Professionals do not understand all SharePoint aspects and vise versa.

To make matters worse, SharePoint architecture underwent a huge change from kerberos to claims and this meant a lot of pervious concepts don't appy and lot of new tools are not claims aware.

The objective of this session is to clarify

1. Clarify how to configure SQL BI in a Claims based SharePoint 2013 environment.
2. What works and what does not work with claims.
3. All necessary terms and concepts provided to SQL Professionals who will them be able to work with the SharePoint teams fearlessly.
4. Advanced consultants, will be able to configure the integration between SharePoint and SQL BI completely.
