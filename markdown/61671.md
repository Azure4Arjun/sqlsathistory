## Title: Anatomy of a Transaction
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server, the transaction log is the most important file in any database.  All changes to the data and schema are tracked in the transaction log.  Join me to learn how to read the transaction log, how to follow a transaction as is processes, and how SQL Server handles a transaction rollback.  You will also learn how to identify the resources and objects SQL Server accesses during the course of the transaction.  Finally, you will see how SQL Server processes transactions for In-Memory tables.
