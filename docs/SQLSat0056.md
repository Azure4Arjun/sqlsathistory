## Speaker: Jose Chinchilla
## Title: Business Intelligence: Decaffeinated Please!
## Abstract:
### For many Database Administrators, Data Analysts and other IT and Business Professionals, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehousing (DW) may be a new and uncharted territory with no clear path towards the destination.

I will also go over the natural roadmap towards BI success, its maturity stages and some of the factors that influence a successful BI project. I will exemplify all these concepts by showcasing a successful real-world BI and DW solution.

# Implementing a Data Cleansing Component for SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-56)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room: MPR4025
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Implementing a Data Cleansing Component for SSIS
## Abstract:
### To ensure consistency across data integrated from multiple systems, the application of standard data cleansing routines is a best practice. Examples of data cleansing include translation of NULL values to defaults, trimming string values, and consistent formatting for textual data such as telephone and social security numbers. While these routines can be implemented using standard SSIS components, the resulting logic must be duplicated for each source and column which creates a development and maintenance burden.  This session will walk through the process of creating common data cleansing routines in a custom component to enable code reuse with minimal effort across many packages.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: SSIS and SSRS Better Together - Long
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  and Reporting Services (SSRS) are two pillars of Microsoft's Business Intelligence stack:  SSIS gathering the data and SSRS displaying the data.  Do you know that SSRS provides a set of Web Services that SSIS can use to manage and even render SSRS reports? In this session we will develop an SSIS package that exports an SSRS report to pdf format using these Web Services.  Then we will use the SSRS Web Services in a Data Flow Script Component to get data from a report.

# Transition from DBA to BI Architect

Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room: MPR1200
## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Transition from DBA to BI Architect
## Abstract:
### Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.
