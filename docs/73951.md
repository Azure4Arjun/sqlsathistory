## Title: Reading Execution Plans Successfully
## Abstract:
### If you've seen an execution plan but didn't know how to read it, this session is for you.

The goal of this session to learn how SQL Server is interpreting your query into an execution plan. We'll discuss execution plan internals, how SQL Server estimates the cost of your query, and what a graphical execution plan is displaying through its operators.

Learning to read an execution plan is a great way to begin troubleshooting performance. At the end, we will take a look at how SQL Server 2016 (and 2017) provide more tools for exploring execution plans.
