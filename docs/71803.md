## Title: Serverless Computing: Azure Functions, Logic Apps and Azure SQL and CosmosDB
## Abstract:
### Serverless is all about allowing us to focus only on the business problem we have to solve, removing all complexity related to infrastructure management, scalability and maintenance.
Azure offers many options in that space and two of them are particulary interesting: Azure Function and Azure Logic Apps. 
What are you needs? Hanlding data coming from a form? Invalidating cached data when a file changes? Responding to an external event like new customer added to your CRM?
Everything can be done very easily and with the language of your choice, or even via an easier workflow-like approach, that doesn't even require you to write code. 
No matter which approach you decide to take, you'll need to store data somewhere. Depending on the scenario you may want to use the new multi-API CosmosDB or the well established Azure SQL.
In this session we'll see how all the mentioned technologies can help us to have architectural choices to be more efficient and effective in our job.
