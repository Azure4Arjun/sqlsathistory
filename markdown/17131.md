## Title: Performance Troubleshooting Sql Server
## Abstract:
### Perfomance is a concern for every dba.   How do you baseline performance?  What do you do when users complain about performance?   What tools can you use to gather data and how do you analyze that data?   We will start a basic performance troubleshooting methodology and move into more specifics of what data to collect and how to use that data to isolate a performance problem.
