## Title: Working With XML In SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!
