## Speaker: Steve Knutson
## Title: Business Intelligence for all with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Itâ€™s a fact, we are now recording and storing more business data than ever before. Whether you are the CFO, Marketing Manager,  HR Manager, customer services representative or business owner, you are probably swamped with data that is meaningless unless you spend hours building the mother of all spreadsheets. Power BI allows you to visualise and analyse data from a wide variety of sources, both in-house and off the cloud quickly, easily and at a price everyone can afford.

Learn how Power BI improves your Business Intelligence. In this session Steve demonstrates Power BI dashboards, reports and natural language queries to answer real-world business questions.
