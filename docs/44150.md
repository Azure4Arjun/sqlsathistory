## Title: Going beyond SELECT *
## Abstract:
### You know how to do the basics: selects, joins, filtering. What comes next? Sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what comes after SELECT * FROM.  This session covers some of the more advanced features of TSQL that you may not know about. We will cover subqueries and the different ways they can be used. We will cover the different windowing functions and how they can be used. And finally we will cover the MERGE command.
