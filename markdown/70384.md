## Title: Troubleshooting Issues with Extended Events in real time
## Abstract:
### Extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration specially when you don't have any benchmarking data for troubleshooting issues. In this session, we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time. We will demonstrate how this feature enables new possibilities to capture real time problems without enabling any third party tools or inbuilt SQL Server features to capture issues like blocking,  deadlocks, high CPU and many more.
Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008 but by SQL Server 2016, it has enhanced significantly. After this session, hopefully you will start using extended event, if you haven't started using till now.
