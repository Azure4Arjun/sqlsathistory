## Title: Secrets of SQL Server: Database Worst Practices
## Abstract:
### “Oh no--what have I done?” Chances are you have heard, or even uttered, these words. This demo-oriented session shows many examples in which database pros have been dumbfounded by their own mistakes. It might even bring back memories of your own early DBA days. This session exposes the small details that can be dangerous to the production environment and SQL Server as a whole and talks about worst practices and how to avoid them. The session focuses on common errors and their resolution. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that they can immediately apply to their own servers.
