# Turbo-Charged Transaction Logs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Maxwell
## Title: Turbo-Charged Transaction Logs
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood components of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long start-up times, problems with the transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log works and how to optimize its performance. You'll learn how to determine the right settings for maximum throughput, and what to do when things get out of control.

# Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
## Abstract:
### Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jim Dorame
## Title: How to collect a baseline on all your servers and still get a good night's sleep.
## Abstract:
### Your boss comes up to you and asks you why the system is slow, unless you know how your system is supposed to respond you are stuck scrambling to answer those questions.  With a few free quires and some SSIS magic you can capture a Baseline of your systems.  With this you will be able to know exactly where to look and what might be amiss.  Before you can say what is wrong with your system you need to know how it reacts under normal circumstances.  This session will provide the tools you need to start collection of your systems baselines and give you a great deal of information.

Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction
## Abstract:
### It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.

# What is a Latch, and Why Do I Care?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: What is a Latch, and Why Do I Care?
## Abstract:
### Latching is a necessary function of the database engine. Although latching is a topic is normally presented only in expert-level sessions, a good grasp of the problems excessive latching exposes is important even for novice tuners. This session focuses on the PAGELATCH_* and PAGEIOLATCH_* wait types, explaining what is happening, why it is happening, and how to use the exposed information to tune queries and solve performance problems. If you've seen these wait types in Activity Monitor and wonder what they meant, then this session is for you!

## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Introduction to Window Functions
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

# Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
By Learning a little Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

# Biml for Beginners: Speed up your SSIS development
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Biml for Beginners: Speed up your SSIS development
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating and maintaining a large number of SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over and over again. Handling metadata and schema changes is a manual process, and there are no easy ways to implement new requirements in multiple packages at the same time.

It is time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) software engineering principle to SSIS projects. First learn how to use Biml and BimlScript to generate SSIS packages from database metadata and implement changes in all packages with just a few clicks. Then take the DRY principle one step further and learn how to update all packages in multiple projects by separating and reusing common code. 

Speed up your SSIS development by using Biml and BimlScript, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!

## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods

# Anatomy of an Optimizer
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Luke Jian
## Title: Anatomy of an Optimizer
## Abstract:
### In this session, we look in depth at how the query processor architecture and show what operations it performs during query optimization to generate equivalent query plans and find a “good enough” plan with limited time during query optimization, explain query optimization phases and show a few DMVs that are useful when diagnosing optimizer behavior
We will also explore the differences between In-Memory OLTP tables vs Disk based tables, and have a look at some considerations when you use the new cardinality estimator
We explain why query optimization complexity increases exponentially with the number of tables included in the plan, and how to diagnose and remedy issues that relate to bad query plans

# Effective Data Visualization: The Ideas of Edward Tufte
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: David Giard
## Title: Effective Data Visualization: The Ideas of Edward Tufte
## Abstract:
### We spend much of our time collecting and analyzing data. That data is only useful if it can be displayed in a meaningful, understandable way.
Yale professor Edward Tufte presented many ideas on how to effectively present data to an audience or end user. 
In this session, I will explain some of Tufte's most important guidelines about data visualization and how you can apply those guidelines to your own data. You will learn what to include, what to remove, and what to avoid in your charts, graphs, maps and other images that represent data.

# Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

# Context  Calculation, Back to the Basics with DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)
Event Date: 05-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Austin Senseman
## Title: Context  Calculation, Back to the Basics with DAX
## Abstract:
### The learning curve for DAX isn't a straight line - it starts off gradual and quickly gets steep.  With a syntax similar to Excel, DAX seems easy enough for an Excel power user but things quickly get confusing without a good foundation in the basics of DAX.  Those basics - context and calculation - are the topic for this session.

This session is for the intermediate DAX user who has produced some quality data models and DAX calculations but who is still having difficulties with functions around filtering, time intelligence, and complex calculations.  We'll go through a number of practical examples that show that DAX at a fundamental level is a combination of creating filter and row CONTEXTS and then using those contexts to produce CALCULATIONS.  Understanding this concept is a must to produce more complex code in DAX and it's also a very useful framework for someone just getting started.

## Speaker: Mark Broadbent
## Title: Lock, Block and Two Smoking Barrels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform but due to its complexity (and bad programming practices) can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates and much more!
In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. Now in SQL Server 2012, 2014 and 2016 even more have followed, but many challenges and problems still remain.
Let’s take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate Pessimistic and Optimistic isolation understanding how they work, when you should use them, and more importantly when they can go very wrong. Don't be staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two Smoking Barrels and join me for this revealing and thought provoking presentation.

## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Top 10 Clustering Dos and Don'ts
## Abstract:
### Clustering SQL Server still vexes many in one way or another. For some, it is even worse now that both AlwaysOn features - clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) - require an underlying Windows Server failover cluster. Storage, networking, Active Directory quorum, and more are topics that come up quite often. Learn from one of the world's experts on clustering SQL Server some the most important items - both good and bad - that you need to do to be successful whether you are creating an FCI, AG, or combining both together in one solution.

## Speaker: Pat Phelan
## Title: Data Architecture 101
## Abstract:
### This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.

### As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.

## Speaker: Fred Bliss
## Title: Big Data in the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### 'Big Data' has been the buzzword of the past few years. With the exception of a few niche verticals and use cases, it's often been a solution in search of a problem, as well as a word in search of a definition. With decision makers excited to push big data and predictive analytics solutions within organizations, data architects and developers must quickly understand its strengths within an enterprise BI architecture.

This session aims to define big data from the perspective of the enterprise data warehouse, while also arguing that both big data and data warehouses compliment one another perfectly. By using Google's big data analytics platform (BigQuery), SSIS, and a data warehouse built in SQL Server, we will illustrate how big data can best serve your organization, while also combining cloud and on-premise solutions across competing technology platforms.

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Virtual SQL Servers, Actual Performance
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance are discussed, and the knowledge gained can help you work with your infrastructure engineers so that you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes are demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

# Time to Stretch: Scaling out with Azure DB Elastic Scale
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#484---Chicago-2016)

## Speaker: Warner Chaves
## Title: Time to Stretch: Scaling out with Azure DB Elastic Scale
## Abstract:
### Elasticity is one of the main promises of cloud computing. The cloud has given us the ability to programmatically add or remove resources to an application and dynamically respond to our workload volume to allow for cost efficient, high performing solutions. However, achieving this elasticity in a transparent way can be a challenge in itself.

In particular, dynamically scaling the database tier can be difficult due to having to deal with distribution schemes, data movement, application routing and the actual increase or decrease of the database resources. Azure SQL Database and the Elastic Scale .NET API combine to provide a solution to these challenges in an easy to use but powerful set of capabilities. 

In this session we will demo the elastic scale API, elastic db pools, elastic query and elastic database jobs and how they combine to bring database elasticity in your own application and take advantage of true cloud optimized infrastructure!
