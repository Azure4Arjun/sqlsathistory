## Title: Automating Routine Maintenance
## Abstract:
### You have installed SQL Server in your environment, but now what? Unfortunately, far too many servers are neglected after SQL Server has been installed and the applications are up and running. In order to sustain a SQL Server instance that provides optimum performance, it requires constant maintenance. Luckily, you can use the same tools within SQL Server to automate maintenance tasks that you use to meet the business needs of the organization. This session will cover the tasks you need to perform in order to maintain a healthy instance of SQL Server as well as the tools you can use to automate them.
