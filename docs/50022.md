## Title: XML X-Treme!
## Abstract:
### At some point we’ve all had to work with XML, and you may have even searched XML documents in a text editor.  However, did you know that you can query XML documents within SQL Server?  In this session, I’ll show you how you can query XML documents as a data source right along with SQL Server tables and how to optimize your queries for better performance.  You’ll learn how to check conditions that determine if the data you need exists and how to deal with incomplete or missing data.
