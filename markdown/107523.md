## Title: Azure Key Vault, Azure Dev Ops and Data Factory how do these Azur
## Abstract:
### Can we store our Connectionstrings or BlobStorageKeys or other Secretvalues somewhere else then in Azure Data Factory(ADF)? Yes you can! You can store these valuable secrets in Azure Key Vault(AKV).
But how can we achieve this in ADF? And finally how do we deploy our DataFactories in Azure Dev Ops to Test, Acceptance and Production environments with these Secrets ? Can this be setup dynamically?
During this session I will give answers on all of these questions. You will learn how to setup your Azure Key Vault, connect these secrets in ADF and finally deploy these secrets dynamically in Azure Dev Ops. As you can see a lot to talk about during this session.
