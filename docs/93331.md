## Title: Maximizing Big Data ROI via Best of Breed Technology Patterns  Practices
## Abstract:
### Not long ago the question was whether your organization had big data. Did you have the volume, the velocity, the technology. Now those basics are largely given for most people attending this event. The path to success is still fuzzy, however, with so many technologies to choose from – and so many ways to use them.
 
This presentation triangulates in a holistic manner on the modern business dilemma: how can we leverage technology to improve revenue, profit, market share, quality, and numerous other success criteria. That said, this is not about the analytics or KPIs -- although it is about measurable improvement. It’s about lining up the right technologies and using them in effective, proven ways to maximize Return on Investment (ROI). Since the slant here is holistic, we’ll show how to blend infrastructure, tools, methods, and talent to avoid and constantly trim technical debt… and to produce success stories that are consistently repeatable, not a byproduct of individual heroics.
