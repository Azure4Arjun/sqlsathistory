# Top Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Top Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance
## Abstract:
### This session, updated for SQL Server 2012, will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you the top 10 Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.

# Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Multi Track
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.

# Strategies for Working with VLDBs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: Strategies for Working with VLDBs
## Abstract:
### Very large databases (VLDBs) are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love.

Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer and minor issues become major very quickly.

In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to minimize your maintenance window requirements, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas.

Demos will include how I set up a log shipping secondary and a replica of a 2 TB database in less than half an hour.

# Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups
## Abstract:
### If you work with very large databases (VLDBs) that must be replicated, you should be using initialization from backup. There are a some misconceptions the have caused DBAs to assume that they could not use initialization from backup. In this session I will explore those misconceptions and prove that they are incorrect.

Demos will include initializing a subscriber from a transaction log backup and performing a partial restore of a database and initializing the subscriber from the partial backup.

# SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track
## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.

## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: T-SQL Brush-up:The Best Things You Forgot You Knew
## Abstract:
### You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool. This session is chock full of code examples, including before-and-after demos and how-tos.

# Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: AD Track
## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will emerge victorious!

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Building Your Own SQL Server Virtual Playground
## Abstract:
### As the number of SQL Server versions and features grow over time so does the the difficulty in maintaining a set of tools for working with all of them on your local machine. Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

# Working With XML In SQL Server 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#107-Houston-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: AD Track
## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Working With XML In SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

## Speaker: Kris Hokanson
## Title: Beyond the Where: Full Text Search tips and tricks
## Abstract:
### Lots of people know that Full Text Search is a powerful tool for searching unstructured data but did you know that you can utilize its power for structured data as well?  Functions like FREETEXTTABLE and CONTAINSTABLE open up some pretty groovy doors in terms of usability.  We’ll discuss ways to give your users that search engine like interface that everyone has grown accustomed to without sacrificing query performance.  We’ll also hit on creating synonyms to give your users results even when they aren’t quite sure what to search for.  It’s an entirely different type of search altogether.

Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: AD Track
## Speaker: Rick  Morelan
## Title: Avoid Errors on Errors
## Abstract:
### Did you know that BEGIN TRAN…COMMIT TRAN is not enough to make everything work together? People are often shocked when they see the demo where there are errors in a transaction and it still commits. When SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action or control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome to the way you want it. This is a very common workplace faux pas and a Microsoft Certification topic for Dev and Admins. We will use lessons from SQL Programming Joes 2 Pros Vol4.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Introduction to the XML source
## Abstract:
### XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

## Title: Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0
## Abstract:
### The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.

## Title: SQL Server Security for Developers
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has a robust and granular system for granting and denying access to users, but all too often we see applications running as DBO or even sysadmin. Why? Part of is that same granular system can be overwhelming and part is that many developers don't see the point in applying such granular security. In this introductory level presentation we'll start at the beginning with creating and managing logins, take a quick look at system roles, and then get into the nitty gritty of users and roles and permissions at the database level. Along the way we'll talk about why its so important to set security at the database and not just rely on the application enforced security.

## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. Denali AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.
