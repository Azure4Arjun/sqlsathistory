## Title: Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Most administrative functions consist of repetitive sequences of tasks which just take time.  PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment which allows an administrator to automate those repetitive tasks, providing better results to the organization while saving the administrator time, and ensuring that the tasks get done properly every time.  This session will give an introduction to PowerShell and demonstrate a number of scripts which help SQL Server administrators effectively manage their environments.
