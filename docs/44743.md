## Title: SharePoint 101 for Beginners
## Abstract:
### In this introduction to SharePoint session, attendees will learn about the building blocks of SharePoint, such as: What is a list? What is a library? What is a web part? Should I view/edit documents in the browser or in the client? What is versioning? How do I check out and check in a document? Additionally, attendees will learn how to create, modify, and switch views, as well as set up and manage alerts. This session will include demos in Office 365, but the concepts apply to all versions of SharePoint, from 2003 to 2016.
