## Title: Devops  Continuous Release for the DBA
## Abstract:
### I've been working on a DevOps team for more than year. Join me as I talk about culture, tools, and processes that are all part of the journey to continuous release.  My goal is to get you thinking about how your job as DBA or database developer changes when you're part of a team that is striving to release faster. Part of that will be sharing the tool stack I use right now and why, and some of the many challenges I've hit so far.
