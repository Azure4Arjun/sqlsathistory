## Title: I See What You Did There - Automating Auditing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### You are a DBA, not a psychic.  If you want to know who is making changes, trying to access confidential data, or unsuccessfully attempting to login as the Web service account on any or all of the SQL Server instances you manage; you donâ€™t need a crystal ball to gain the power of insight. However, if you follow along in this presentation you will be able to use the magic of SQL Server Audit to peer into the past with Power View and tell the professional future of the unwary soul who crossed your path. None shall PASS!
