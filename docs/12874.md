## Title: The Last NULL in the Coffin: Missing Data, SQL  the Relational Model
## Abstract:
### Missing data has possibly been the thorniest aspect of database management: without a logically sound yet practical solution, data professionals and users are left between a rock and a hard place. They must either (a) rely on SQL's arbitrary and flawed implementations of three-valued logic (3VL) based on NULLs and risk results that are easy to misinterpret, or wrong in ways hard to discern, or (b) undertake in applications a prohibitively complex, error prone and unreliable burden that belongs in the DBMS.
This presentation outlines a relational (2VL) solution to missing data that is devoid of NULLs and theoretically correct.
