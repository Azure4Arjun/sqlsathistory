## Abstract:
### If you like an interactive and lively sessions them this is the place for you.
We’ll look at the background of this term – and see how it has transformed to bring focus to the data professional.
We’ll take a peak at what it means for the technology professional as well as what it means for the business professional - and we'll see Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and the cloud in action.
We’ll look at the different kinds of disciplines that lead to a well-rounded DevOps set up.
We’ll have a run through some of the motivations for developing a DevOps mindset and we’ll also hear about some of the arguments for non-adoption.
We’ll look at some of the other IT methodologies that we’ve seen emerge over the years and examine exactly what sets DevOps apart from these.
Regardless of if you’re never heard this term before or you have strong feeling about the subject – either way – you’ll leave the room with a new perspective and quite likely you’ll have contributed to your fellow delegates kn
