## Title: Taking your Data to SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### Working with data is core to what we do as developers. With the release of the Microsoft SQL Azure Database cloud offering, developers have a new set of options and features that make it possible to take full advantage of the scalability and availability of this platform. In this session, we take a look at what SQL Azure means for developers and show how to create and manage a database in the cloud. We also explore the tools and the practices for using the tools.
