## Title: SQL Server Databases in the Clouds
## Abstract:
### Application servers or services running on a cloud platform now have many options for their database engines. We discuss the various alternatives for providing Microsoft SQL Server services to cloud-based applications, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google GCE, and multiple options within those environments.  Why would you choose one approach over the other? What are the trade-offs on cost, performance, availability, security, ongoing maintenance, required skill sets, etc.
