## Title: Spark'em All - Azure Databricks Demo Hour
## Abstract:
### Azure Databricks is one of the hottest data services in Azure nowadays. Microsoft puts it in many “so called” referential architectures, and recommends it in many scenarios – starting from analytics, through ETL processes, ending with Data Science and Deep Learning use cases. The purpose of this session is to showcase strengths and weaknesses of this platform and to clarify when Databricks can “do the thing” in a modern data platform architecture.
