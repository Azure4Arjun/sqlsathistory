## Title: Certification and IT Career - Self Case Study
## Abstract:
### Several years of work in one industry. A few years in another. The first professional exams, certification and specialization. For last few years, the next - this time in ICT. Even more exams (successful or not), the requirements, specializations, orientations. Is certification for information technology or information technology for the certification? Where to start, what to stop. Where is the end to the possibilities, and where the boundary joy of work. As far as proving something to someone in need IT career. These and several other strange, philosophical, perhaps unnecessary questions I will answer. A few would be left to their own assessment.
