## Title: SQL Server 2012 PowerView - What's missing?
## Abstract:
### As part of the new SQL 2012 release there is a powerful tool called Power View. lt integrates with SharePoint 2010 to provide a easy to use tool to manipulate SQL Server Analysis Services data into beautiful charts and graphs. There's one problem... it's missing a few things that our client
(and probably many others) needed.
 
ln this session I will show how we utilized custom
development, Open XML 2.0. and a few other tools to remedy the problem.
