## Speaker: Dan  Beutler 
## Title: Life++: Data mining your life
## Abstract:
### Sense that although you’re getting a lot done, you might not be doing the right things? Wonder if there are changes you could make to your life to get better results? Found something that really helps you to get more done? I’ve spent the last 15 years reading, listening and trying out everything I can find about self-improvement, trying to discover the silver bullet of effectiveness. I'll share what I’ve learned, and listen to what works for you. I’ve been able to apply statistical analysis and simple data mining to my own life and accelerate the pace of improvements. This session will briefly cover the basic themes of self-improvement literature, and then dive into how I found surprisingly helpful information using tools like Excel and Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services and how you can use them to search through the data in your life. Expect to walk away from this collaborative rambunctious session with a new perspective about what is possible.
