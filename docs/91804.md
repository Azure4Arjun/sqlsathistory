## Title: Protect Your SQL Server Data with Static Data Masking
## Abstract:
### Are you providing adequate protection to your sensitive and confidential data? Iâ€™m sure we all do our best to protect our confidential data in a production environment by allowing only approved methods to access production data. But how are you protecting your development and testing environments when they contain copies of production databases?
In order to protect data and comply with regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA, databases used by development and testing must not contain private and sensitive data from production databases. In this presentation, Greg will demonstrate using a new feature of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) called Static Data Masking to protect your sensitive/confidential data when copying production databases to your development and testing environments.
