## Title: U-SQL Killer scenarios: Custom Processing, Big Cognition, Image and JSON processing at Scale
## Abstract:
### When analyzing big data, you often have to process data at scale that is not rectangular in nature and you would like to scale out your existing programs and cognitive algorithms to analyze your data. To address this need and make it easy for the programmer to add her domain specific code, U-SQL includes a rich extensibility model that allows you to process any kind of data, ranging from CSV files over JSON and XML to image files and add your own custom operators. In this presentation, we will provide some examples on how to use U-SQL to process interesting data formats with custom extractors and functions, including JSON, images, use U-SQLâ€™s cognitive library and finally show how U-SQL allows you to invoke custom code written in Python and R.
