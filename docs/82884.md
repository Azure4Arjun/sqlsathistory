## Title: Azure Managed Instance: Reducing Maintenance Costs While Making Migration Simple
## Abstract:
### While Azure SQL Database provides the full feature of the SQL Server database engine, it is designed primarily for newly developed, cloud-based applications.  For existing applications running on traditional SQL Server instances, the cost and complexity of migration can be prohibitive.  With the release of Azure Managed Instances, much of the cost and complexity have been removed.  Join me for this session to learn about the differences between Azure SQL Database and Azure Managed Instances. Additionally, discover methods for migrating existing instances to Azure.
