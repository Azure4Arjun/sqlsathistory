## Title: SQL CLR from 2005 to 20015, Not how, but why and when
## Abstract:
### 2005, Big buzzâ€¦. Microsoft added a NEW FEATURE to the SQL Server, which allow users to extend the Server abilities, by importing external CLR libraries. Hundreds of articles and discussions were held around the same time, asking: is Transact-SQL dead? Today we are celebrating Tenth Birthday to CLR feature, and it is best time to open the discussion and get some insights regarding this OLD FEATURE.

In this session we are going to focus on the questions WHY to use SQLCLR, and not less important WHEN to use it over transact-SQL. We are not going to talk about HOW to use it. We are going to demonstrate the SQLCLR abilities in practice (all code will be publish latter), we are going to compare different solutions, explain why you have to use it, and show that in practice we all using SQLCLR, yet most DBAs do not write their own code. As part of the demonstrations, we will show how to implement new features from SQL server 2012 / 2014 on older versions.
