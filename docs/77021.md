## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a legal requirement. Data masking is the best way to secure non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking isn't encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Masking also isn't just a SQL Server feature, it is a technique common across databases.

Data masking for data at-rest removes the value from the asset.  This reduces your organizations "surface area of risk" overall, permitting your organization to prioritize security efforts where they are absolutely needed.  There are other possible solutions, such as synthesizing data and redaction, which present other challenges.

Come learn about the right way to secure non-production data to limit exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.
