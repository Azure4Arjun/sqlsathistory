## Title: How to become a BI Developer? 
## Abstract:
### This is one of the most frequent questions I get from our website visitors (mainly as we provide BI Tutorials).

I have become a BI Developer and I would like to share my experience and thoughts (and get yours) during this session, which will include:

1) We are not born BI Developers and anyone has a chance to become one!
2) It is not easy but it is easier when you have a clear directions how to get there!
3) Permanent vs. Contractor brief explanation of pros and cons!
4) Money is important aspect so we will talk about salaries and contract rates!
5) My journey to becoming a BI developer was not easy and I have started from not knowing English (in 2005) and any aspects of IT and I worked very hard (and Katie; my wife was my main success factor!) but I no longer want to be a BI Developer so last point is where to go next?
