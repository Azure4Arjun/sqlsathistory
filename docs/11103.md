## Title: Dimensional Modeling: The Basics  Beyond 
## Abstract:
### Dimensional Modeling (DM) is the de facto standard for the design of databases for BI reporting  analytics.  Regardless of whether a database is a data warehouse used for reporting or an OLAP cube or advanced analytics, DM should be the basis for the data model.  This session will cover the fundamentals of DM along with best practices in designing and implementing the data model.  Additionally, we will cover practical situations that require “breaking the rules” of DM and how to implement solutions to these problems.
