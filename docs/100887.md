## Title: Microsoft's Modern Data Warehouse Architecture
## Abstract:
### Microsoft recently announced a rebranding of their Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Azure Synapse Analytics. But, Azure Synapse Analytics promises much more than just a replacement for a relational data warehouse. It represents the culmination of their modern analytics data architecture vision and it spans everything from traditional dataset to big data to streaming real-time analytics all under a single pane of glass. In this session we will go through an architectural overview of platform, discuss what is available right now, what is coming, and how this changes the way we approach analytics.
