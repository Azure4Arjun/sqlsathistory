## Abstract:
### This is introduction to WhereScape RED, an agile development environment â€“ building high quality data warehouses native to SQL 2008, R2, 2012 quickly.  No other toolset can beat the productivity which results in a consistent, scalable, supportable and fully documented data warehouse.
