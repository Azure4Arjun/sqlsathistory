## Title: Plots and Data Points: Pulling R Charts together in a Power BI Da
## Abstract:
### Are you a data analyst or developer who wants to learn R to compliment your reporting skills? In this session we will use RStudio, a free tool for writing R code, to create several data visualizations. We'll talk about what types of analysis each type of chart is best suited for. Then we'll use the custom R visuals in Power BI to display and share these charts. The session will include information on how to setup Power BI Desktop to work with R, some of the common R packages used for creating visualizations and how to use slicers in your PBI dashboard to filter data in R charts.
