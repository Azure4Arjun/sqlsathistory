## Title: Analyzing Text with SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media.
Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with SQL Server tools.
