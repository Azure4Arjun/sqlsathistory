## Title: Learn from the Product Group - Azure SQL DB: Hyperscale
## Abstract:
### This session will be presented by the Microsoft Azure SQL Database Product Group and will cover a deep dive into the architecture for Azure SQL Database Hyperscale. 

The database-as-a-service paradigm in the cloud (DBaaS) is becoming increasingly popular. Organizations adopt this paradigm because they expect higher security, higher availability, and lower and more flexible cost with high performance. It has become clear, however, that these expectations
cannot be met in the cloud with the traditional, monolithic database architecture. This paper presents a novel DBaaS architecture, called Hyperscale.  This session will cover the key ideas and features
of Hyperscale, as well as comparing it to traditional deployment options.
