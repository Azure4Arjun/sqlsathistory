## Title: Who Moved My SharePoint (to 2013)?
## Abstract:
### Change can be a difficult obstacle in any organization. As an IT pro, how do you promote executive and/or business user adoption of SharePoint 2013? As an executive, power or business user, what should you expect? In this interactive session, we will build a SharePoint 2013 training and transition plan that promotes collaboration between the organizationâ€™s SharePoint users and IT professionals for a successful migration. Topics include improved efficiencies, enhanced search functionality, making social features useful for business purposes, what's new for site administrators, and changes to the world of workflows.
