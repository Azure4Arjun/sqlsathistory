## Title: SQL Server Deprecated and Discontinued Features
## Abstract:
### Support for SQL Server 2005 ends in April 2016 - do you still need to upgrade? Each version of SQL Server provides a list of features which are deprecated – meaning they will be removed in a future version – and a list of features previously deprecated which are discontinued in that version. This session will discuss the deprecated\discontinued features starting with SQL 2008 and will show you how to identify deprecated features so that you can upgrade with ease when those features are discontinued in the version to which you are upgrading.
