## Title: Parallel Query Plans - Good and Bad
## Abstract:
### I will review the basics of Parallel Query Plans and discuss a variety of issues. Single CPU query plans can be very complicated. Multi CPU plans add another layer of complexity. There are benefits to using more than 1 CPU to run a query faster but there are also pitfalls. Why do some high cost queries only use 1 CPU? What about CXPACKET? Why can a parallel plan query run slower than the same query using only 1 CPU?  All new computers have multiple CPU cores. This has increased the relevance of parallel plan query execution.If you have questions or stories of parallel plan issues, please share your questions and experiences during this talk.
