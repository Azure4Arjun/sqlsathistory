## Title: A Blueprint for Success with Enterprise Power BI Solutions
## Abstract:
### This session provides a blueprint for launching and maintaining enterprise Power BI solutions. Power BI enables self-service and personal business intelligence for the masses. Launching a Power BI solution is easy. Preparing for increasing data volumes, data variety, and evolving requirements often creates challenges for solution teams. We'll review 1) Data platform considerations: When to use Analysis Services, Direct Query, Power BI Premium? 2) Data architecture considerations unique to Power BI. Design a solution optimized for end user experience, QA, Maps, Security, Mobile, and future data sources. 3) Project management considerations such as requirements gathering, change control, and proper documentation. 4) Enterprise Governance: Administrative settings, Licensing, Sharing, Workspaces, and Apps. Attendees will get documentation templates, links to best practices articles, and reference materials so they can create their own blueprints for excellence with Power BI.
