## Title: Plan Cache performance tuning
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve performance in the Plan Cache will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.
