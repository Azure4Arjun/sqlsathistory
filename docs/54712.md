## Title: My Top 10 Favorite Replication Tricks
## Abstract:
### Replication can be intimidating and a bit confusing. I will show you my ten favorite tricks for working with replication that will show you how you can replicate from multiple sources to multiple destinations, chose the appropriate method of replication and, if desired, put the data in a different schema with a different collation at the destination than it was at the source. I will also cover various methods of managing your publications, agent properties and distribution schedules. This presentation assumes a basic knowledge of configuring distribution and creating a basic publication and subscription.
