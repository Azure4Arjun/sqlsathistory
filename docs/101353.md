## Title: Look Smart  Save Money - Database Optimization, Consolidation,  Capacity Planning w/ SQL Governor
## Abstract:
### Has your manager ever come to you and said "we need to save money on our SQL Server licensing!" and/or "we need to move our SQL Server data to the cloud!"? If they haven't, they will, so wouldn't you like to proactively present them a plan that will save money, make you look smart, and potentially earn you a bonus or a raise? SQL Governor provides you with a comprehensive toolkit that does the heavy lifting and detailed analysis necessary to make your database consolidation and migration projects successful. Its performance analysis tools help ensure that things run smoothly before, during, and after migration and consolidation work. Join Microsoft Data Platform MVP Matt Gordon and SQL Governor Founder/CTO Jani Savolainen as they walk through war stories and case studies from the field, how SQL Governor could have helped, and how it can help you!
