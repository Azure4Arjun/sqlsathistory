## Title: Aggregations in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Aggregations are now generally available in Power BI and are one of the most important optimization methods for managing large datasets. Combined with Direct Query storage mode, they allow big datasets to be analyzed efficiently by answering high level analytical queries quickly from memory while sending more detailed queries back to the source database.

In this session, you will learn about aggregations, different table storage modes, how to set up aggregation tables and configure them to improve query performance.
