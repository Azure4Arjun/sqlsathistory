## Title: Mapping SQL Server Expertise to Azure Cortana Intelligence - Cases and Scenarios
## Abstract:
### Platform as Service offerings now enables developers to roll out their database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations. All of these are new challenges that are coming into the field of responsibility of the SQL DBA professional.

In this session, we'll map Cloud offerings, mainly Azure, that corresponds to the current features SQL Server DBAs use, their use cases for each one based on our client projects, and how they are different to the different SQL Server features we are familiar with. The goal is to get SQL Server DBAs on the latest Azure offerings and the echo of Cortana Intelligence.  If time allows, we will also show some offerings from Google Cloud.
