# SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#410---Chattanooga-2015)
Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT
## Abstract:
### The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.

## Speaker: Robert Verell
## Title: Getting Started With SQL Server Replication
## Abstract:
### In this session we will examine how SQL Server replication works.  A technology that has been around, this tool is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's an excellent way to keep a subset of data synched with another database without having to synch the entire thing (although you could if you wanted to!).  We will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of transactional and snapshot replication pieces so you can implement this technology in your environment and use it as a valuable tool in your personal knowledge book.

# Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#410---Chattanooga-2015)
Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
## Abstract:
### When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

# How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#410---Chattanooga-2015)
Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: DBA/Developer
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
## Abstract:
### With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.

## Speaker: Lindsay Clark
## Title: Beginners SQL Server Security the Low Hanging Fruit
## Abstract:
### Security is not for the faint of heart and this session is just the tip of the iceberg. Those new to the DBA role and of course the Accidental DBA's can take away a few nuggets to get them started securing their SQL Servers and raising awareness to the importance of securing the data we have been sworn to protect. Let this session jump start your journey to learning why DBA's are called the gatekeepers and increase your value in the office while getting noticed for caring enough to stop intrusions to your SQL Servers.

# Why should I care about the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#410---Chattanooga-2015)
Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: DBA/Administration
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly).
