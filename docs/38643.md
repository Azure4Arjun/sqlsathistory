## Title: 2014 SSIS Project Deployment Model: Deployment and Maintenance
## Abstract:
### The 2014 SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Project Deployment Model introduces new opportunities for the delivery of SSIS solutions. Gone are decisions about logging providers, configuration approaches, and deployment targets. Now, you need to focus on the creation of an .ispac, the approaches to deploying the project, and applying configurations to ensure expected behavior.

This session begins by exploring mapping between elements in an SSIS project and their counterparts in the compiled file, the .ispac. The session then covers three approaches for automating the deployment of this unit into SSISDB We then cover the administration side of the SSIS Catalog. You create SSIS environment variables and apply them to configure run-time behaviour. Finally, you work through the native tooling to troubleshoot failed SSIS packages. We'll cover SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) reports, Catalog views, and data taps for run-time collection of values.
