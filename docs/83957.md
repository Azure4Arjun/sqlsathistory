## Title: CSV files and ETL- The Good, Bad, and Ugly
## Abstract:
### CSV files come in a variety of shapes and sizes. If you’ve been working with them for a while, you will know that not all CSV’s are the same. We will cover methods to perform ETL on CSV’s file utilizing T-SQL and PowerShell. The Good- The simple, easy to load structure. The Bad- It looks good in excel, but I’m having difficulty loading it. The Ugly- You want me to load what monthly? That file it too big and it’s structure changes too often.
