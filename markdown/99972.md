## Speaker: Rich Baumet
## Title: Azure Synapse Analytics - Intro
## Abstract:
### Big announcement from Microsoft at Ignite and PASS, but what is it?  Is it just Azure SQL DW rebranded?   No, not really...it's way more than that.  In this session we will talk about what this is and what it means for everyone out there.   I'll give you a clue, no more storage keys, and key vaults to do what you need to do to go from Data Lake to Power BI and everything in between.
