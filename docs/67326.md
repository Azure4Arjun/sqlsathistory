## Speaker: Bill Fellows
## Title: What is Biml and why are SSIS developers excited about it?
## Abstract:
### This session is designed for you, the experienced SSIS developer who's been hearing about the Business Intelligence Markup Language, Biml, but has not taken the plunge. We will cover what the Biml language is and how using your familiar development tools, SQL Server Data Tools, SSDT, and BIDS Helper, you will be able to streamline the creation of SSIS packages.

We will work through progressively more complex examples from a "Hello World" equivalent to a to a full fledged, audited, truncate and reload pattern based on an external metadata repository. 

You will leave this session armed with the knowledge of how Biml can help you achieve a consistent and reproducible approach for the creation of SSIS solutions.
