## Title: Azure Data Factory: Ingesting and Integrating Data for a Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### When you build a business intelligence system for the current times, such as a modern data warehouse, the mantra for getting data onboard is ELT, and not ETL. Building an ELT solution is not as simple as switching two letter; it is a paradigm shift in thinking. In this session, I will brief you on the concept of a modern data warehouse, then move to why its data integration needs are different, how a solution for such a need is designed, and finally how you would build it using Azure Data Factory, and related technologies.
