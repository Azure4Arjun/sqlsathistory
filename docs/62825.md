## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Lighten Up: Soft Skills for Hardcore Techies
## Abstract:
### Your ideas are only as good as your ability to describe them to others.
 
As technology professionals, our tech skills need to be at their peak. However, we often lack the communication skills to describe technical concepts to others, including business users, executives, or even other technology professionals. In this session, veteran IT professional Mike Hillwig, will show you a handful of skills that are essential in communicating with people outside of the database world.
 
You will learn Mike's keys to good storytelling, making analogies, listening, writing, and putting technology concepts into things that give you a common language with business users. You'll leave this session with the ability to influence technology decisions based on your skills explaining why the DBA is usually right.
