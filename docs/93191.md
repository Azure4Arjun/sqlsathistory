## Title: DBA as the Cloud era Data Professional
## Abstract:
### Database Administrators have been safeguarding the business critical data assets of the organizations for decades, managing not just the data but often also the infrastructure in the on-premise environments. However the times are rapidly changing and so are the expectations towards the DBA profession. These new expectations revolve around the ongoing digital transformation across different industries and the DBAs ability to answer to challenges presented by the modern, disruptive technologies.

When it comes to disruptiveness, very few technologies can match the public cloud and as a company working with all the major hyperscalers, Nordcloud has a unique perspective on the requirements on the skillsets needed to manage data in the cloud. Join our session to learn what core DBA skills will still be relevant in the cloud era, and what are the technologies and skills to learn!
