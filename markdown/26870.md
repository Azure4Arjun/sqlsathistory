## Title: Management Studio Features for Working Less and Getting More Done
## Abstract:
### As SQL Server Professionals we spend countless hours inside a single tool - Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - yet odds are you don't know of some of the enhancements that exist inside Management Studio that provide you with the ability to re-use code, parameterize frequently-run scripts, and store all these scripts right at your fingertips.  In this session Tim will dive into some of the less familiar areas of SSMS and give you ideas on how you can work less... and get more accomplished.  We will also touch upon some additional functionality that Red Gate's SQLPrompt offers for taking this one step further.
