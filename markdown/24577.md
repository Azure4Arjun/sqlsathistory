## Title: Understanding SQL Server Statistics
## Abstract:
### This intermediate-to-advanced level session will introduce you to SQL Server statistics: how to create, manage, troubleshoot, and more! Statistics are a key part of getting solid and repeatable performance, and is equally as important as having indexes. SQL Server statistics provide cardinality estimations and selectivity of data. Weâ€™ll also learn how SQL Server automatically creates statistics for the Query Optimizer, making the right plan choices based on estimated costs.
Targeted audience will be IT Developers, Managers and Support Groups.
