## Title: What Counts For a DBA
## Abstract:
### The world of a DBA can be daunting for a person, either as a new or old, because not only do they need to keep up with new and emerging technologies, but also with the code and designs of their coworkers.  In this highly participation driven session, we will employ a random topic chooser to pick several of these traits for discussion as a group.  Possible topics include past blog topics such as Logic, Curiosity, Failure, Humility, Skill and Passion, as well as any other topics that might be added for that day. So come prepared to participate and voice your opinion about what counts for a DBA.
