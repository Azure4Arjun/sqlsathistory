## Title: Using Agile Project Management in IT Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### In this session, a novel framework for disaster recovery will be introduced. This framework is suited for a generic large enterprise, but can be tailored to fit specific needs of virtually any company. Using academic and industry research along with lessons learned, we developed an agile-based project management framework for the orchestration function of IT disaster recovery. This framework is intended to serve as a quick response plan that will improve the rate of response and flow of communication in the wake of a natural disaster like the notorious South Louisiana hurricanes.
