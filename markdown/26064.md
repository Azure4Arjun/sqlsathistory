## Title: Upgrading and Migrating SQL Server with limited downtime 
## Abstract:
### With SQL Server 2012 released and going strong, SQL Server 2014 coming quick, we’re all wanting the latest and greatest, high performing, SQL Engine sitting on our servers. How we do that is another question. How do you get a weekend of downtime? Do you like convincing the business you need it? I don’t and that is why we’re going to look at methods to upgrade or migrate SQL Server 2005, SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 up to SQL Server 2012 and 2014 with as little downtime as possible – minutes..seconds! In this session, we’ll see how mirroring, log shipping and even replication, can make us look like DBA Rock stars at upgrade time.
