## Title: Restoring a SQL Server Database from Azure Blob Storage
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure offers Blob Storage as a cost-effective way to store SQL Server backups offsite. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to go through tens of thousands of files to write a restore script, when your SQL Server goes away.

Leveraging Ola Hallengren's backup solution, this session will describe how to recover the most recent SQL Server backup available, by knowing only the database name and your Azure Storage credentials.
