## Title: Back the Truck Up
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning backups? Yes. Performance tuning backups. As your data grows, so does your DR profile. In this session we'll take a look at how different backup configuration options affect both the performance of your backups as well as the performance of your server during the backups. Of course, this is also sneaky way to introduce a real-world use of Extended Events during the process.
