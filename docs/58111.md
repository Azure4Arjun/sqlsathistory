## Title: The SQL Server v.Next Availability Story on Linux
## Abstract:
### Although the paint on SQL Server 2016 just finished drying, Microsoft is already working on v.Next and preview builds are already available. One of the biggest changes is that SQL Server will be supported on Linux in addition to Windows Server. This means that all of the considerations we have for deploying instances and databases will be relevant and possibly different on Linux. While the story is still a work in progress, this session will cover how SQL Server v.Next can be made available based on what is known at this time. If you want to get a head start with SQL Server on Linux, this session is for you.
