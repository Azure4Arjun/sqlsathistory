## Title: When Reporting is More than Reporting
## Abstract:
### Is your day full of repetitive tasks that you would like to hand off? Maybe you can push them back to the source. SSRS can empower you to empower your users. By pass the UI team and do it yourself. We will discuss options and considerations you should know about to create a report process to populate data your users are asking you to populate with validation and defaults.
