## Title: So What is Power BI?
## Abstract:
### This session will provide the attendee with an introduction to Power BI Desktop and how to use it with external data sources (sources may vary but could include Web Sites, SharePoint, SQL Server, Excel, Text, or Access). It will compare and contrast it with the features of Power Pivot and Power Chart.  Along with way, it will cover some basic table editing techniques, working with data from multiple data sources, and creating multiple visualizations on the same desktop that will interact with each other during the data analysis.  This session might be of special interest to anyone currently using Power Pivot, Power Chart, or Power View to see how this tool can be integrated into their toolbox of Business Intelligence skills.
