## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: Don't Box Me In:  Escape the Cubicle
## Abstract:
### I've been telecommuting in some capacity or another since before I was a DBA.  For 13 years I've been able to be a productive, responsive, integral and valuable asset to my company without maintaining a physical presence within the confines of a corporate office.  Let's have a conversation and discuss what has (and has not) worked for me over the years.  Let's discuss the traits of a good telecommuter as well as those attributes that may not make this the right arrangement for everyone.  We will even discuss what my Managers have done over the years to not only acommodate telecommuting, but to embrace and succeed from having staff that work remotely!  

This session is aimed at staff and management alike.
