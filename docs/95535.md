## Title: Battle Tested Monitoring for Always On Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### You are the go-to guy for your company.  You are not only coding but also administering
SQL Server in your organization. You've also implemented one of the coolest High Availability
feature â€“ Always On Availability Group. However, you are not sure if you are monitoring everything that you should and you don't have a commercial tool to help.
Lately, there were some issues reported where you have seen AG is lagging behind, and it has eaten up your time and effort analyzing what went wrong
I can help you here!! I can share some of the monitoring scripts that I have written, and I can show you some monitoring tips that can help you. I would also like to help you with some of the metrics/counters that you would like to capture for analysis to make sure your Always On Availability Group is healthy. These are the things that you would love to try and implement in your environment. By the way, have you ever think of getting this monitoring via a Power BI tool? If not, ready to see the repo
