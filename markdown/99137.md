## Title: A Moment in Time: About Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Are you a developer or analyst who has been asked what changed for a particular record, and thus need to get the record at a given time? Well, in 2016, we were introduced to system-versioned temporal tables in SQL Server, which can tell you the full history of what the data looked like if you ever need to fend off questions. You will get to know the business uses for temporal tables, how they are built, the ways to query temporal table records, converting your current in-memory tables, and other elements to consider.
