## Title: Does This Look Weird?  The Importance Of Baselining
## Abstract:
### How do you know when your server is on fire?  Without a set of known-good measurements to compare against, you don’t.  This session will show you how to capture a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance and help you decide what to capture, and where to store it. Finally we will put it all together by walking through a scenario using the captured baseline data to identify a problem.
