## Title: Device provisioning with Azure IoT in a Nutshell
## Abstract:
### Scaling from a few connected devices while developing a proof of concept to thousands or millions 
of devices deployed in the field is not trivial. 
In the IoT device life cycle, provisioning is key for scaling securely. 
This talk is about main concepts and implementation when we need to provision IoT devices for modern Azure 
IoT Solutions.
During this session, you'll get a sneak peek into how Azure IoT enables seamless, 
zero-touch registration of devices to IoT Hub with security that begins at the device and ends with our cloud.
