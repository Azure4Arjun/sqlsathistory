## Title: Automating the Data-Centric Deployment Pipeline
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment are common elements of modern DevOps practices.

In this session, we’ll cover why these approaches are beneficial for the data organization and the pieces you need to have in place to be successful. We’ll also cover some of the prime trouble spots that organizations run into, as well as some tools that can help jump start your efforts.
