## Title: Mirroring Start to Finish
## Abstract:
### Mirroring is not dead! If you don't have Enterprise Edition, then this is still your tried and true solution.  Weâ€™ll cover what mirroring is from start to finish, how it can fit into an HA/DR plan, the rules surrounding its use, configuration via the GUI and T-SQL, as well as how to monitor mirroring. This presentation is designed to walk you through a basic implementation. At the end you will have learned what mirroring is, how it can fit into your environment, what business requirements it solves, and how to configure it.
