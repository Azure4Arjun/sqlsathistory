In this session, you will learn why Azure SQL Database might be for you. Next, you will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. You will learn how to successfully migrate your database schema and data. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.
