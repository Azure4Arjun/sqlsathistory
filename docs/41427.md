## Title: How to collect a baseline on all your servers and still get a good night's sleep.
## Abstract:
### Your boss comes up to you and asks you why the system is slow, unless you know how your system is supposed to respond you are stuck scrambling to answer those questions.  With a few free quires and some SSIS magic you can capture a Baseline of your systems.  With this you will be able to know exactly where to look and what might be amiss.  Before you can say what is wrong with your system you need to know how it reacts under normal circumstances.  This session will provide the tools you need to start collection of your systems baselines and give you a great deal of information.
