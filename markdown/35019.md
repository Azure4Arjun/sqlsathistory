## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Hints
## Abstract:
### Most of the time, the SQL Server query optimizer does a great job of selecting an optimal query plan. On a rare occasion it does not, and when it does not, then hints are sometimes needed to help the query optimizer create an optimal query plan. In this session we will:

•	Learn when to use, and not to use hints
•	Learn how to implement commonly used hints
•	Learn hint best practices
