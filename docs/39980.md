## Title: Office 365 - The Art of the Possible
## Abstract:
### Office 365 has many different capabilities that have historically been separated into different products. The convergence of the products on one platform is opening up new possibilities for collaborating in new, more effective ways.

This session will explain some of the ways that Office 365 is being used and demonstrate some of the capabilities that convince millions of companies to invest in Office 365 to replace existing products with a single unified environment making the most of the familiar business critical tools from Microsoft.
