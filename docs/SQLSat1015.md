## Speaker: Nikola Ilic
## Title: From XL to S - Reduce your Power BI model size by 90%!
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what makes Power BI so fast and powerful when it comes to performance? So powerful, that it performs complex calculations over millions of rows in a blink of an eye.

In this session, we will dig deep to discover what is “under the hood” of Power BI, how your data is being stored, compressed, queried, and finally, brought back to your report. After the session, you will get a better understanding of the hard work happening in the background and appreciate the importance of creating an optimal data model in order to get maximum performance from the Power BI engine.

Finally, you will see a real use-case demo showing how the Power BI data model was reduced by 90%!

## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: BI in Azure two years live
## Abstract:
### After more than two years live with BI in Azure Alexander Klein would like to give an honest feedback. 

Which architecture is the right one? Which tools/services should I use ( Azure Data Factory V1 or V2, Azure Stream Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Analysis Service, Azure Data Lake, Power BI, Azure Databricks ...) ?
What was good and what wasn't so good? What do you have to pay attention to? What can you possibly do better in the next project?

Alexander Klein will answer all these questions and more in this presentation.

Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Thomas Martens
## Title: DAX - Musings about foundational concepts
## Abstract:
### Much has been said about DAX, and even more will be told, as DAX still evolves and the adoption of tools that are using DAX like Power BI and MSFT Analysis Services Tabular is growing. I got inspired for this session by questions from https://community.powerbi.com. These questions are touching the most foundational concepts. They remind me of my journey into the realm of evaluation context, filter propagation, data lineage, the scope of variables, and the mysterious world of table iterators, just to name some concepts.
I explain these concepts using small datasets that allowing us to perform computation without leveraging the cloud, but please be prepared for some surprises. The presentation uses a single pbix file that will be available for download after the session.

# Not My Problem(?) - Azure Networking 101 for Azure SQL Server DBAs
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1015)
Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: Cloud Technology
## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Not My Problem(?) - Azure Networking 101 for Azure SQL Server DBAs
## Abstract:
### The unofficial scapegoats of the the IT world has always been "the network" or "the database". The traditional way of doing things on-prem has unfortunately added to this divide - either you're a networking specialist or a DBA, and very rarely will the same person do both jobs. 
As an on-prem DBA, chances are that you never had to think twice about which network the database was in, what kind of endpoint was used for the traffic or how the firewall was configured. In Azure, things can get rather complex pretty quickly - especially when working with the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) version of Azure SQL Server. 
This session will walk you through the basics of networking, explore the concept of virtual networks and firewalls, and explain the use of endpoints - all from the perspective of how they relate to Azure SQL Server. We will be looking at both how the technical components work, and also why one would choose a specific design in favor of another.

## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Business Analysis with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### You can make advanced business analytics also with T-SQL, you do not need to use R, Python, or some other currently fashionable language for every single in-depth view in your data. In addition, you can get magnitudes better performance inside a database management system when in statistical languages and engines. You will learn how to use T-SQL for queries that you might already be familiar with, for aggregating queries. But this is only to warm you up. Then you will learn how to do hazard and survival analysis, market basket analysis with association rules using different measures like support and confidence, and even sequential market basket analysis, when there is a sequence in the basket. Then the session introduces the look-alike model, which is a mixture of k-nearest neighbor and decision trees algorithms. The session finishes with Bayesian inference implemented with T-SQL.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Crushing a Cloud Migration: Moving Mountains While Migrating Data
## Abstract:
### Are you an architect or DBA who has been tasked with executing a cloud migration? Are you a consultant who is trying to wrestle with the scale and scope of a cloud migration for a client? While there are certainly technical issues to solve and tooling selections to understand and execute, what often gets lost in a migration are the political and organizational mountains that need to be moved for the project to be successful. Technical success will not happen with our organizational success - they work hand in hand to lead to a successful conclusion.

As we walk through this session we will discuss and demo the technologies and tools that are useful for a cloud migration - and we\'ll review some that are not useful and talk about why they should be avoided. We will also mix in discussions of successful migrations and how the team worked together to move those organizational and political mountains out of the way in order to execute a successful cloud migration to make clients, customers

# Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1015)
Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
## Abstract:
### Gaps and islands problems are often treated as academic problems that are discussed without relevant real-life problems to solve.

By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion.  We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data in order to everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.

## Title: Azure SQL anywhere. An Introduction to Azure Arc enabled Data Services.
## Abstract:
### Until very recently, Azure SQL was just for... well. Azure. Join Data Platform MVP Ben Weissman as he explores Azure Arc for Data Services, Microsoft‘s solution to deploy services like Azure SQL to any cloud – including private clouds – using kubernetes. He will take us through the core concepts of Arc enabled Data Services and also demo how easy it is to deploy an Azure SQL Managed Instance on premises (or in any other cloud) while still being able to see it’s telemetry etc. from the Azure portal.

# Power BI Dataflows on Steroids: Handling 100+ million records using Enhanced Compute Engine
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1015)
Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Ferenc Csonka
## Title: Power BI Dataflows on Steroids: Handling 100+ million records using Enhanced Compute Engine
## Abstract:
### Power BI dataflows used for self-service data preparation within the Power BI ecosystem. When a large volume of data and complex transformations should be handled, Enhanced Compute Engine should be enabled to support DirectQuery queries against Power BI dataflows and accelerate the transformations in upstream dataflows. In this session, we will present how to use Enhanced Compute Engine for managing 100+ million records in multi-phase ETL processes containing complex transformations, then implementing Power BI composite models and aggregations over this large amount of data stored in Power BI dataflows. We will also present in detail the best practices for Power BI dataflows to manage such a huge volume of data. We will focus also on how to store dataflows in your organization’s ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2 account instead of using the built-in one.

# Financial Modelling with Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1015)
Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Bob Duffy
## Title: Financial Modelling with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Bob has been involved in taking Financial Models from paper based to highly dynamic analytics models in Microsoft BI for many large enterprises in Ireland.

Building Successful Financial Models based of a Chart of Accounts and General Ledger can be difficult for a number of reasons:
-	Dynamic/Growing Chart of Accounts
-	Many to Many Structure
-	Parent Child
-	Ragged Hierarchies on financial reports
-	Unary Operators such as running sums 
-	Entity Attribute Value structures
-	Overhead Allocation
-	Modelling Profit Variations like EDBITA

Bob will show the “secret sauce” to financial modelling for General Ledger (GL) structures such as Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet.

Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: The ins and outs of securing SQL Server traffic
## Abstract:
### We are frequently hearing of an enterprise-size business being hacked, data being stolen, or data being exploited. Data security has always been important, but it should not be taken for granted. Data is information, and one of the greatest assets to a business, and when it is compromised, things go south quickly.

While there are multiple levels of security (securing data at rest, data in traffic, etc.), this session will focus on securing data that is on the move; ie., securing traffic between a client and server. We'll discuss and look at two solutions: Certificates and IPsec, exploring them in detail, outlining the pros and cons of each, how to set up and configure them, and when to use what.

Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Developing a Solution with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
## Abstract:
### If you want to launch a Python or R project with data which lives in SQL Server, SQL Server Machine Learning Services may be right for you.  In this talk, we will take a look at SQL Server Machine Learning Services, starting with an overview and installation, but quickly moving into custom development.  We will deploy packages with sqlmlutils and investigate some of the nicest features of Machine Learning Services, including native scoring and parallel processing.  We will also see how to develop and deploy custom code and tie everything back to .NET applications using stored procedures.

## Speaker: Julie Koesmarno
## Title: Notebooks 101 for SQL People
## Abstract:
### Are you a database developer, a DBA or a data analyst? Do you find spending quite a bit of time trying to reproduce analysis or reproduce issues and the troubleshooting techniques? This Notebooks 101 session is for you!

The lack of rigor in being able to reproduce analysis in business context or to reproduce data troubleshooting can lead to confusion and time wasted on work that had been previously done. With Notebooks, Data Professionals can share their techniques and data sources used for the data analysis or troubleshooting for code review and reproducible insights/troubleshooting. 

Azure Data Studio Notebooks support SQL and KQL natively with intellisense; with easy to use charting capabilities. With Notebooks and Jupyter Book (collection of Notebooks) in Azure Data Studio, it’s also easy now for your team to build an onboarding guide (user manual) / documentation on data sources, useful sample scripts and tutorials.

## Speaker: Craig Porteous
## Title: DIY ETL with Logic apps, Azure Functions and more
## Abstract:
### How do we handle the edge cases, the unique or temporary solutions to get data from emails, file shares, FTP, someone's desktop etc? 
We need DIY ETL when the easy data sources don't exist, and the usual methods won't work.
In this session, we'll take 3 scenarios, solve them and make them reliable, and repeatable, with tools like Power Automate, logic apps, Azure functions and more.
