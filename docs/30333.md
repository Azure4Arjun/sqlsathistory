## Title: Building a Shard for SQL Azure using .NET 4.0
## Abstract:
### In this session I will discuss what it takes to build a shard against SQL Azure. Shards allow developers to access data across a farm of SQL Server or SQL Azure databases transparently. This session places a strong focus on C# and evaluates .NET 4.0 and shows you how to leverage the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and the new Caching namespace to achieve greater performance access SQL Azure. View http://enzosqlshard.codeplex.com/ for information about this shard.
