## Title: Power BI Pro, or Premium: that is the question
## Abstract:
### One question that always pops us during my Power BI assessments for companies planning to adopt Power BI is which SKU to buy. The choice might seem obvious to your organization, but there is much more below the surface. Join this session and learn important considerations that might influence your decision, including:
•	Licensing cost
•	Hosting organizational semantic layers
•	External reporting
•	Features
•	On-premises reporting
