## Speaker: Cindy Bean
## Title: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Change Automation
## Abstract:
### Automation and Continuous Delivery are at the forefront of software development processes today.  However, databases are being neglected because database code is different, harder to automate, and DBAs just don't seem to trust database automation. This is not surprising when you consider the number of incidents and instances of downtime that were caused by out-of-process updates, code overrides, and other database glitches. In this session, we will explain the options to automate database changes along with the benefits and issues with each option.

Event Date: 05-12-2015 - Session time: 15:05:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Dave Fackler
## Title: TFS for SQL/BI Developers
## Abstract:
### If you do any kind of SQL Server or BI development, you eventually have to grapple with the problem of keeping multiple copies of your work.  You either need to maintain stored procedure and DDL scripts or you have copies of SSIS and SSRS reports to keep up with.  In most cases, this problem starts off small as you need to have development versus production copies of your code.  But eventually, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your "source code" as your environment becomes more complex and as you potentially have to start working with a team of other developers.  During this session, we'll talk about Team Foundation Server (TFS) and show you the different ways it can be used to keep up with all the different types of source code you might be responsible for -- from full database designs to complete BI solutions.

Event Date: 05-12-2015 - Session time: 15:05:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: SSIS: Design principles for robust ETL processes
## Abstract:
### Is the design of your ETL processes robust?  Does your ETL process keep you awake at night?

Data integration is still the most common point of failure of data centric projects and choosing a mature ETL tool, such as SSIS, is not enough.  In many cases this is due to improper planning and the use of questionable design principles. During this session we will look at ETL processes from a holistic point of view to identify key areas that are often neglected and that have the potential to affect the system reliability and increase its maintenance cost. We will use SSIS to evaluate key ETL architecture areas - such as re-start ability, monitoring, error handling, among others- and discuss design principles you can use to improve the architecture of your ETL processes going forward. You will find the session valuable regardless of you level of expertise in ETL.

## Speaker: Mark Hudson
## Title: What Can Data Quality Services Do for You?
## Abstract:
### In 2002, U.S. businesses lost an estimated $600 BILLION a year because of data quality problems. In 2012, Microsoft offered Data Quality Services (DQS) to reduce some of that loss.  DQS enables analysts to recognize data quality defects and manage business rules to correct those data defects. Once defined, those business rules are available for use throughout the enterprise in SSIS packages so the data loaded is as clean as the business-defined rules. Standardizing and de-duplicating data are no match for DQS. Join me as I profile and standardize data before your very eyes.

## Title: T-SQL for Application Developers - Attendees chose
## Abstract:
### That's right, attendees choose! I'll show 30 possible topics on the screen, and the attendees vote on which topics I'll cover. Everything from isolation levels to ranking...everything from GUIDs to table-valued functions....everything from querying temporal data to instances where subqueries are necessary....everything from update triggers to reading execution plans. The good news is that you'll walk away with 30 code samples, even though we'll only cover a portion of them in the presentation. This has always been a very popular session.

# A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS

Event Date: 05-12-2015 - Session time: 15:05:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.

## Title: Only You Can Prevent Database Fires!
## Abstract:
### Do you find yourself constantly putting out "fires"? Can't take anymore heat in the data center? We as DBAs can easily become burnt out with dealing with these daily blazes. Wouldn’t it be grand to learn how to prevent these fires from scorching us to begin with? In this session, we will jump into things you can start implementing as "fire prevention" to stop the "fire fighting".  We will talk about several things that you can take back to your shop and put into action easily ranging from code tuning, backup maintenance, monitoring and performance tuning!
