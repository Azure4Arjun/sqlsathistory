## Title: U-SQL custom extractor for multi-gigabyte XML
## Abstract:
### With emerging industry data standards like ISO20022, FpML, XBRL, HL7 etc. XML is getting more and more common as a standard for exchanging data. The advantages are numerous, but mainly on the definition and validation part of the story. When the XML is getting heavy - let's say > 1gb - many out-ot-the-box approaches start running into processing issues and the XML gets too big to handle.

During this session we will explore and compare DOM, Streaming, LINQ, XPath, and .NET serialization for processing big XML. In the final Azure Data Lake approach, you will see how to separate the concerns of large file handling and parsing complex XML. Running on Azure Data Lake enables for integrating this into your serverless big-data pipeline.

Hands-on stuff where solutions will be shared with attendees.
