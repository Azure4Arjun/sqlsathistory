## Title: Business Continuity with SQL Server: Real-Life War Stories
## Abstract:
### Having worked with hundreds of customers over the years on their high availability and disaster recovery deployments, at SQLCAT, we have learned a few things. We have learned how old problems are solved by new technologies, and how new technologies bring up new challenges. We have learned what customers do when situations put them between a rock and a hard place, how they solve tough business problems, how they circumvent technology limitations. We will share these lessons with you in the form of war stories â€“ stories you can apply to your world when you or someone you know encounter such situations.
