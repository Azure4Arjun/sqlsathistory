## Speaker: Peter Myers
## Title: Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. In this session, learn how a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with machine learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and integration of predictive insights.

This session has been specifically designed to describe machine learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing developers taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease in which it can be accomplished.
