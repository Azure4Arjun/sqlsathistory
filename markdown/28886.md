## Title: T-SQL Awesomeness – 3 Ways to Write Cool SQL
## Abstract:
### There’s nothing quite as satisfying as writing a cool bit of T-SQL.  Luckily for us, there are some truly awesome ways to make your data do just what you need it to do, while improving performance and/or readability.  Come learn three new-school ways to expand your T-SQL repertoire with:  
•	Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE)
•	EXCEPT and INTERSECT
•	CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY
We will look at data models and scenarios you might encounter that lend themselves to these techniques, see old-school ways to solve T-SQL challenges, and then compare them to newer, leaner ways to get the same result set.  Impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad T-SQL skills.
