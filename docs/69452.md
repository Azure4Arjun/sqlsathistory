## Speaker: Jens Vestergaard
## Title: Delivering BI Continuously
## Abstract:
### This session is tightly coupled to Visual Studio Online (VSO) as the central component to orchestrate the path to an automated deployment process. The tool itself is so much more than just a code repository, and once we have unlocked the power of VSO, you will quickly realize the sky is the limit. Focus in this session will mainly be delivered on processes around SSAS, SSIS and SSRS and we will also briefly touch on Continuous Delivery for the underlying Data Warehouse. Come join this session, if you are ready to take the first few steps towards automation of your deployment processes and want to know how Microsoft tools can help you. 
 
In detail we will be looking at these components:
Visual Studio Online
3rd. Party Add-Ons
Build Agents
Powershell
Codeplex projects
 
And these processes:
Build
Test
Release
