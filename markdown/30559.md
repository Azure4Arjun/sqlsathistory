## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: The Tally Table: What it is/how it replaces loops
## Abstract:
### Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL. There are dozens of things we do in SQL that require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters" and "loops" to most people and recursion to others. To those well versed in the techniques of "Set-based" programming, it means some form of a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden takes the mystery out of how this wonderfully compact tool works and how it easily replaces many types of loops. This session has been updated to include additional information about what “Pseudo-Cursors” are and how they work as well discovering why “Recursive CTE’s” can be your worst enemy.
