## Title: The importance of data strategy
## Abstract:
### Data is not a by-product of a new wiz-bang application.  Databases are not just a container for the shiny new website.  Databases do not exist simply to be managed.  Data is the reason for creating the applications and the IT infrastructure to support it.
According to TDWI poor data quality costs businesses in excess of $6 billion per year.  The cost of good data existing in multiple systems and business processes to work around or with poor or multiple copies of the same data is likely much higher.
This session will address the data in your environment instead of the container that it lives in.  We will look at Master Data Services in SQL Server 2008 R2 and how it can help your organization rethink and help define your data strategy.
