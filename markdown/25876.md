## Title: Intuitive  ad-hoc reporting: SQL 2012 Power View
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Power View provides intuitive ad-hoc reporting for business users such as data analysts, business decision makers, and information workers. They can easily create and interact with views of data from tabular models based on PowerPivot workbooks published in a PowerPivot Gallery, or tabular models deployed to Analysis Services (SSAS). Power View is a browser-based Silverlight application launched from SharePoint Server 2010. In this session I will give you an overview of the key features of Power View and then I will develop some of these views and export them to interactive PowerPoint slides.
