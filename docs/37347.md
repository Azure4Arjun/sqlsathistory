## Title: Internet of Things
## Abstract:
### It is predicted that 4.9 billion things will be connected to the Internet in 2015 and is expected to increase to 25 billion by 2020. With this growing number of devices connected to the Internet, we will no longer be in a world of stand alone mobile apps and websites. We need to start thinking about the Internet of Things.

In this talk, we will cover statics of what is coming, how to stay secure, along with a demonstration of the integration of hardware and software.
