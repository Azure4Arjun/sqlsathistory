## Title: How to be a DBA and retire Rich
## Abstract:
### Yes, how to be a DBA and retire rich.  This is a session in the ‘off the beaten path’ or the ‘miscellaneous track’.  You will learn nothing SQL Server technical in this session, but will learn about the Modern Portfolio Management theory in Finance.  I will conduct a practical discussion on how to structure your 401(K) portfolio or your general investment portfolio for the most optimal asset allocation and maximum return while minimizing taxes and expenses.  You can use the practical tips in this session to consider options to streamline your portfolio to maximize returns.  This session may serve as a wakeup call to do something about your portfolio.  When it comes to retirement, clearly, luck is not a strategy.
