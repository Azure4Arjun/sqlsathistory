## Title: Query Store and Automatic Tuning in SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL DB
## Abstract:
### One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release was Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight data recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information over time – including the text, the plan, and execution statistics. The addition of wait statistics information – tracked for each query plan – in SQL Server 2017 makes Query Store a tool that every data professional needs to know how to use, whether you're new to troubleshooting or someone who's been doing it for years. When you include the new Automatic Tuning capabilities in SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL Database, suddenly it seems like you might spend less time fighting fires and more time enjoying a lunch break that’s not at your desk. In this session, we'll talk through these new features - and see them in action - so you can understand how you can immediately start to use them once you’ve upgraded to SQL Server 2017.
