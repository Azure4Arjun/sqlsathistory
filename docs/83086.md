## Title: Data Compression: Squeeze Out Some Free Gains
## Abstract:
### Since data compression is now a standard level feature (2016 SP1+) learn how to squeeze a little extra performance out of your databases for free!  We’ll cover the types of compression available, the costs and benefits and how to determine good candidates for compression. Once we know what we want to compress we’ll cover three ways to apply it, including the easiest way to compress your whole database to meet best practices with just one line of code!
