## Title: Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Containers, and You
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Studio (ADS) provides a cross-platform tool for SQL Server.  With ADS, you can manage connections, develop and execute code, and build and run Jupyter Notebooks.  Notebooks allow formatted text to be combined with executable code and can be render in a browser, making them ideal for wiki pages and runbooks.  With the November 2019 release, both T-SQL and PowerShell code can be executed in a notebook.  This allows docker commands to build and manage SQL Server containers from within a notebook.  Join me for this introduction to ADS and SQL Server containers.
