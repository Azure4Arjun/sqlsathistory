## Title: The Rise of the Flash Powered Economy
## Abstract:
### Flash storage has revolutionized everything from smart phones and mobile computers, to web searches and social media. Unfortunately, it's been nearly impossible to deploy flash across a data center without breaking the bank. Pure Storage has cracked the code and destroyed the disk status quo. All-flash storage is now affordable enough to use broadly across any enterprise. Every company should enjoy the performance, space and efficiency advantages of flash as well as the lower maintenance, power, cooling, rack space and management costs. With Pure Storage, your business can achieve things that weren’t even imaginable with disk. No more wondering how much data you can analyze, how fast you can respond to a customer, or how quickly you can launch a new service. It’s time to unlock the productivity and creativity of your company while delivering a responsive experience to both customers and employees. All applications. All customers. All budgets. Flash for all.
