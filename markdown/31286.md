## Title: Configuration Domination: Taking Control of SQL (M
## Abstract:
### We all know that every environment is different, so how can we expect the default SQL Server installation to be optimized for each one. In this session, we will look at some of the configuration options you can change after you have installed SQL Server to maximize performance, security, and reliability. We will also cover the configuration changes you should make that are often overlooked after your server or your database has been upgraded.
