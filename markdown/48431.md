## Title: JSON    XML;  since SQL 2016 it is important to weigh respective advantage
## Abstract:
### The session begins with „JSON“ and shows with a syntax-comparison the similarities to XML.
Both the different operational scenarios and the technical background
of JSON and XML, however, require a different range of functions and language.
Therefore, initially, as far as practicable the parallels will be demonstrated.
Especially the T-SQL  extensions  „FOR JSON“  and  „OpenJSON“  are very similarly implemented in comparison to „FOR XML“ and „OpenXML“.
Furthermore the new functions  „IsJSON“,  „JSON_VALUE“ and  „JSON_QUERY“  are now contained in T-SQL. Do they also have these as T-SQL functions for XML or can these results be calculated with XML-methods?
Additionally, XML has some more features which concern saving ( and indexing ) and requesting 
(in particular with XQuery) in relational tables. These will also be demonstrated exemplary. 
The goal of the session is to show, when which language is of advantage in which case.
