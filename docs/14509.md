## Title: Whatâ€™s your Imperative doing in my Declarative?
## Abstract:
### T-SQL is one of a minority of computer languages where you describe the results rather than code an algorithm.

In this all-demo session we will explore several such commonly used constructions that are detrimental to SQL Server performance and scalability.
