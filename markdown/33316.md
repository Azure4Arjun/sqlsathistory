## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: Development Mise en Place
## Abstract:
### Chefs and cooks have a process called mise en place (MEEZ ohn plahs) which translates to "put in place". For cooks this means "organize and prepare" their stations. They have everything they need ready and in the right place. It also means to remove all distractions. 

In this session I will show how developers and DBAs can use this method to better organize their time and efforts to get more done with less rework.
