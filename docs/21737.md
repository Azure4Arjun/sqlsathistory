## Title: New Data Management Capabilities with SQL Server 2
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is one of the most commonly virtualized applications in VMware environments. With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft introduces full support for SMB. Now you can install SQL Server 2012 with both system and user databases on SMB file shares.  This  allow you to build end-to-end NAS solutions where the data management capabilities of NAS, such as volume auto grow and the ability to shrink NAS volumes, can be taken advantage of by the SQL Server.  This session will demonstrate how to install and run SQL Server over SMB and VMware NFS storage.  Best practices, caveats, and performance of SQL Server database over SMB and NFS will also be discussed.
