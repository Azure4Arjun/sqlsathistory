## Title: SQL Serverâ€™s 2016 Hidden Gems for BI Developers
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 contains many brand new features, which are important to BI developers, including NUMA support for SSAS Tabular, parallel processing partitions, Tabular Model Scripting language and others. In this session, I will focus to not well known feature enhancements in SSAS 2016, which can developers benefit from, like DAX improvements (DAX variables, new DAX functions), bi-directional cross filtering, translations, calculated tables, consistency checker and extended events for SSAS, and more.
