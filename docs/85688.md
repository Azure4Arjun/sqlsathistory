## Abstract:
### Email reports are common and useful for reporting when a process succeeded or failed. You might have also figured out how to make it easier to read with HTML content, and even HTML tables. Sometimes, it still needs more, and needs to be easier.

Come see how to use Python to add graphs of your data to emails as a picture. Plus, you'll see some easier ways to create HTML content for emails using Python.

You'll be surprised how little code is needed for this. It's simpler than you think!
