## Title: Using FileTables
## Abstract:
### The FileStream feature allows BLOBs to be managed by the DB.  FileTable expands on this feature by using specific tables for storing these BLOBs. This allows Windows apps to access these items as if there were stored on the file system but with benefits only a database can offer, such as text searching and querying.
