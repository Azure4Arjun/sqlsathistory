## Title: Empowering your data sharing architecture
## Abstract:
### This session will show attendees how to use database replication to manage the ever-increasing volume of data by using database replication to maintain near real time copies of databases closer to the consumers of that data.  We'll discuss the use of database replication to both distribute and consolidate data with no impact to performance or reliability.
