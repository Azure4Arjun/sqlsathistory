## Title: DH2i: Stand-alone to High-Availability Clusters in Minutes
## Abstract:
### Don’t miss this demonstration of the hot new container technology that will change your assumptions about what it takes to implement high-availability clusters on premises or in the cloud. Join DH2i’s OJ Ngo as he transforms standalone SQL Server instances into an automated HA cluster failing over between mixed-OS systems—in just a few minutes. In fact, he’ll have plenty of time left over to show you some other cool tricks with his new cluster, such as: QoS controls at the instance level, SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start, and multi-subnet geo-clustering capabilities.
