## Title: Native JSON support in SQL 2016
## Abstract:
### Alongside with all other features SQL 2016 now natively supports JSON – one of the most common formats for data exchange. SQL 2016 now has built-in capabilities to query, analyze, exchange and transform JSON data. 
JSON functionality is quite similar to SQL XML support  but despite this being one of the most desired additions to SQL 2016 there is a flavour of something missing – the JSON data type. 
In this session we will talk about JSON support features, limitations and some tricks to overcome these.
