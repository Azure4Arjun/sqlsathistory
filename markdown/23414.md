## Title: Visualising  your data with PivotViewer
## Abstract:
### Discover the power of PivotViewer, the Silverlight control that enables users to visualise large data sets in an extremely effective and tangible way. Quickly filter, sort and see how your data relates to each other in a way that traditional reports cannot. This session will cover what the  PivotViewer control is and how to get the most out of it with your own data. Even if you've used PivotViewer before, see what's new in the recent Silverlight 5 version to enable you to make the most out of your collections.
