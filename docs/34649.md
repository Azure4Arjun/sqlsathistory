## Title: Introducing Contained Databases in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Portability and tempdb collation conflicts are challenges currently faced with traditional databases.  SQL Server 2012 introduces a new feature called Contained Databases that overcomes these challenges.  This session is an introduction to Contained Databases and will look at the different types of containment; how to create, connect to and manage a contained database; and database portability made easy.
