## Title: Going Live! Upgrading to SQL 2012 with Log Shipping
## Abstract:
### Want to see an in-the-trenches example of transitioning a SQL2005 server to a SQL2012 server? This session will review how we upgraded a SQL2005 server to a SQL2012 by utilizing Log Shipping, speedy restore operations, and quick thinking. This isn't a technical demonstration of how you COULD do something:this is a review of how we planned, organized, and executed a server upgrade. I'll include some of the problems we encountered and troubleshot before, during, and after the upgrade.
