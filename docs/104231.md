## Title: Document Design for Document Oriented Databases
## Abstract:
### When designing your documents for databases such as MongoDB, CosmosDB, or DocumentDB you should not be following old normalization rules. What rules it should your follow? This session will give you a good foundation for figuring this out. I'll be surveying some common use cases and how to model them. We'll discuss some rules of thumb, and discover both how and why certain designs work better than others. Relationships, entities, indexes, memory, working sets - all the familiar concepts in an all new light.
