## Title: Launch a Cost-Effective Mentoring Program
## Abstract:
### Your technology organization needs a mentoring program!

- It's easier than you think.
- You can do it now.
- You don't need special skills.
- It's inexpensive to start.
- The benefits are measurable and substantial.

The key is to keep the business goals for the program at the forefront. When mentoring and learning become vital, expected parts of work, and when you measure results, you're headed for success.

I'll show you how I started and nurtured a mentoring program at SJV Data Solutions. Participants included software developers, managers, and product professionals. In under a year, this program improved products and advanced careers. The positive effect on the bottom line was unmistakable. The program's benefits far exceeded expectations. Plus, a well-designed mentoring program scales; most weeks, I spent under two hours running the program.

Conducting this mentoring program is the most rewarding thing I have done in my tech career.  I can't wait to share these ideas with you!
