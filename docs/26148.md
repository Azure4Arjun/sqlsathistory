## Speaker: Theresa Eller
## Title: Self-Service Business Intelligence with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Microsoft recently introduced the Power BI Designer to empower self-service business intelligence charts, reports, and dashboardsâ€”without writing code. This session will begin with the Power BI Designer to build charts from data stored in SQL. Then we will bring those charts into a Power BI dashboard and review the options available there. Finally, we'll examine the underlying technology: Power Query, Power View, and Power Pivot, which are free Excel 2013 add-ons that provide additional capability not yet available through the Power BI Designer.
