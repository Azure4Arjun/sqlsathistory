## Title: Getting the most from your SAN - File and Filegroup design patterns
## Abstract:
### You’ve been given the task of optimising the File and Filegroup layout to get the most from your storage. Not sure where to start, or thinking you could get a more from your storage with a different design?

Are your SAN guys telling you your storage can process 2 GB/s but you're only seeing 200 MB/s?

This session will dive into how to optimise your File and Filegroup layout strategy to get the most from your I/O Subsytem, including a case study where we took a customer's table scans from 500 MB/s to 1.2 GB/s with only a change in filegroup layout.

Topics covered include:
- Layout for OLTP
- Data Warehousing Fast Track Style
- Data Warehousing on a SAN
- Get data into your SSAS cubes faster (ProcessData)
- Hidden options and “go faster” buttons 
- How to maximise performance in enterprise edition and master read ahead
