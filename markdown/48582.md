## Title: Implementing security inside SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Having a good understanding of what security features are available and what configurations are considered best practice can be crucial to your  company's data security.

This is very much a HOW TO session, both in terms of how to decide what feature combinations work best for your environment and how to implement those features.
