## Title: Service Broker - Async In the DB
## Abstract:
### For years we searched for a solution to better manage the synchronous database logic in our legacy application.  Between triggers and stored procedures, basic transactions got slower and contention increased.  If only we had a free, always available solution within SQL Server to help us make some of these processes asynchronous! Through a twist of fate we (re)discovered Service Broker in the last year and have found it to be a great solution to solve some long-standing problems.

In this session I'll take a look at this "older" technology introduced with SQL 2005. I'll discuss what it is, how it can be used as a local database messaging queue, and how it can effectively allow you to do asynchronous trigger and stored procedure logic that wasn't previously possible.

You'll leave with ideas of how to refactor existing logic and setup your first SSB conversation. We'll also cover some of the initial pitfalls many people run into and considerations for using SSB in larger environments.
