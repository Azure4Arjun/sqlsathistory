## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: are your developers all using cursors? SELECT *? Running dynamic SQL using sysadmin privileges? And all in production despite your warnings? WHAT DO YOU DO? Answer: You attend Revenge: The SQL! This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices without actually killing them. You'll see demonstrations of little-used features in unconventional ways. You'll also see methods to prevent common mistakes that even you might make, like dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause accidentally. We'll also demonstrate the dangers of too many permissions and how to convince everyone to never use the sa login again! Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but youâ€™ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.
