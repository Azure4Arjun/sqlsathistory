## Speaker: Sven Vosse
## Title: Power BI + Microsoft Flow + PowerApps = Real Magic
## Abstract:
### BI is certainly about interactive reports and clever analysis, but for it to be truly valuable, your insights must easily be turned into actions. 

In this session we’ll explore how combining Power BI and two other Power Platform apps, namely Microsoft Flow and Microsoft PowerApps, we can turn BI into “insights AND action”.

We will walk through a popular use case of a Sales Rep visiting a client, and integrating Flow, PowerApps and Power BI on a tablet one can vastly improve customer satisfaction, significantly reduce workload and administration, and improve sales volumes.

Here are some of the things we’ll cover:
•	Validate stock levels on the spot to avoid ordering an out-of-stock item
•	Place orders directly from Power BI using Flow and PowerApps to integrate with your ERP system
•	Don’t miss out on any lost opportunities by viewing past order history using insightful Power BI visuals
•	Trigger workflows automatically instead of completing the admin later
•	CRM Integration
