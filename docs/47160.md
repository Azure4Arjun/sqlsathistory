## Title: Optimizing the SQL Server and Databases for large Fact Tables
## Abstract:
### A session full of demos demonstrating how SQL Server startup parameters, trace flags and the create database and alter database command when used correctly for the underlying hardware can make scanning your fact tables much faster.

We will also as a side effect explore the Mary Go Round query feature and find ways to bulk load data faster and learn how to load from an OLTP system with zero impact to it.
