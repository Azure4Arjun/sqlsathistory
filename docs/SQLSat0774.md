## Speaker: Todd Kleinhans
## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality
## Abstract:
### Every day around the world, billions and billions of queries are run using SQL Server. By understanding how queries are run will provide a greater insight into learning how both the relational and storage engines work for better performance and troubleshooting.

This presentation has taken the concept of a flow chart and a mind palace and turned it into a virtual reality (VR) experience. The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of technical information and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. 

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using a video game engine from Epic Games called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

# Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-774)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: John Sterrett
## Title: Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning
## Abstract:
### The way you tune your SQL Server workloads are changing.  In the past, you would rely on dynamic management views, execution plan cache, and server-side traces or extend events.  In SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to Columnstore indexes; In SQL 2014 the cardinality estimator got a huge overhaul. With SQL Server 2016 we were given query store to allow us to get more insight into our performance pains and execution plan changes. SQL Server 2017 gave us Automatic Tuning and Adaptive Query Processing to help automate performance improvements. In this session, we will harness the ways you improve performance into the new so you can automate the pain away and spend more time identifying and tuning pain points that cannot be automated.

Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 12:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: Master Data Management in the GDPR Era
## Abstract:
### Master data management (MDM) is a set of tools and processes that provide visibility into enterprise data and where it is stored and used, while also keeping it current and relevant. MDM is architected in two forms: analytical MDM and operational MDM. In this session, you will obtain a good business and technical understanding of how both types of MDM can help you achieve business clarity across the organization through a data governance strategy to help work within GDPR.

How does GDPR effect businesses inside and outside of the EU? What is required to do business with EU citizens? There are many questions to address today, and those questions necessitate a reliable and accurate overview of not only your data but of individual customers. MDM addresses this necessity and can serve as the technical basis for GDPR compliance.

## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.
 
We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.

## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: Fishing for Answers: Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Did you ever hear someone say “make your data lake your staging area for your data warehouse” or “a data lake can handle any data format” or “if I build a data lake data everyone will use it”?  Really? Are these good ideas and true statements?  Is there a design strategy that I should follow so I don’t end up with a “data swamp”? Are there tools or techniques to load data into the lake and get data out easily? Can I easily visualize my data in the lake? What about security? And finally, how does a data lake really fit into my BI landscape when I have so many infrastructure and tool options to pick from?
This session will demo putting data into a data lake, pulling data, visualizing data, and testing data lake performance.  I will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and implementation approaches.  At the end of the session everyone should have a clear picture of what Azure Data Lake is, how to implement it, and is it a good fit for your organization.

# Speed Up Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization

Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 14:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Speed Up Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size. Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is often too costly due to the size of many databases, especially non-production. More importantly, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around and time itself is costly. The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is very true with data.

Because providing full databases for each developer on each project seems unrealistic, for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared non-production environments that are refreshed only every few months at best. Conflicts occur, quality suffers.  Development is slow and fails to keep up with business needs.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Clone things easily and quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Speaker: Kris Hokanson
## Title: That's bad mkay!
## Abstract:
### We've all heard that things like nested views, cursors, and under/over-indexed tables are bad...but why?  What is the real cost of the badness that abounds in the database world?  What's really going on when you run that query against a view of a view of a view.  How can you quantify what happens when that cursor ends up running the same simple query thousands of times.  And how can indexes really impact the way SQL Server decides to solve your queries.  In this session we'll talk about the basics of how to read query plans and use extended events to understand why all these things can be big resource drains on a SQL Server.  Good times should be had by all.

## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016/17
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system-maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: inMemory OLTP for developers
## Abstract:
### With the significant improvements made to in-memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016, it’s natural to expect significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at in-memory tables their best use cases as well as development best practices. We will also look at the changes to the indexing design for inMemory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Finally, we are going to cover how to build fast scalable applications which utilize inMemory objects as well as choosing the appropriate indexes for your inMemory objects to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.

## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: I/O Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Speaker: Kevin Mackey
## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
## Abstract:
### Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Abstract:
### Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: COZYROC: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.
