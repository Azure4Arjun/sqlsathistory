## Title: Why You Should Consider Implementing Indexed Views
## Abstract:
### This session will include an explanation of what indexed views are, the types of problems that they solve, and their limitations.  Additionally, I will provide a methodology for determining whether or not you should consider using indexed views to solve problems in your environment - including how to test and compare them to some alternatives.  I will then go through some demos and provide more opportunities for the audience to ask questions.
