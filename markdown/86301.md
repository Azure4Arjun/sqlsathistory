## Speaker: Kendra Little
## Title: The Changing Role of CIOs and the Value of DevOps
## Abstract:
### DevOps practices are a powerful tools to build productive, engaged teams who constantly learn and regularly deliver value to their customers. High DevOps performers report greater workplace satisfaction than their peers. But implementing DevOps isnâ€™t a matter of being great at writing code, or choosing the right technologies: to become a high DevOps performer, you need the powerful catalyst of executive support. In this talk, we will discuss the value of DevOps from the perspectives of CEOs, CIOs/CTOs, and Managers. We will explore how the role of CIOs and CTOs are undergoing a major transformation, and how DevOps aligns with that transformation. You will leave the session with a fresh take on how to discuss DevOps with company leaders, and an understanding of how to explain the value of DevOps to people in these roles.
