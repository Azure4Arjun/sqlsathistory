## Title: Configuration Option and Trace Flag Secrets: Surprising Behavior at the Flick of a Switch
## Abstract:
### If you’ve been a SQL Server DBA or Dev for any length of time, you’ve probably heard of various options that you can set at the instance- or database-level that can impact performance.  Do you know what they are, when to use them, or what they do?  And what about all of those trace flags?  There are so many of them and many are undocumented.  What gives?  In this session, you’ll learn about a variety of ways to speed up IO, adjust memory, change plan and buffer cache behavior, debug the SQL query optimizer, and how to punch SQL Server in the face!
