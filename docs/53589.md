## Speaker: Brian Larson
## Title: Calculate, Aggregate amp; Filter: Truly Understanding DAX
## Abstract:
### To get the most from our SSAS Tabular and Power BI models, we must be able to create robust DAX expressions. This requires a solid conceptual understanding of DAX expressions, especially the interaction of aggregates and filters with the Calculate() function. In this session, we will also look at time analytics and hierarchies within DAX expressions. As we explore the ins and outs of DAX expressions, we will call out new features and functionality available in DAX in SQL Server 2016.
