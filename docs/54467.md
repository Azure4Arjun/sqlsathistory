## Title: Building a Performance Monitoring System Using XEvents
## Abstract:
### You are using Extended Events and dynamic management views (DMVs) to analyze performance problems in your databases. How do you go from there to building a performance-monitoring system that is easy to use and that works at scale? In this session, learn techniques for loading and parsing Extended Events into a central monitoring database in close to real time, correlating the events with query plans, indexing the data for performance, and making the information easily available.
