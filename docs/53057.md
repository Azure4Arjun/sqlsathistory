## Title: Standardize Your Baseline
## Abstract:
### The concept of baselines have been around for many years, yet all too often they are not executed on a regular basis and don't contain enough information, I believe this is because most DBA's don't have a standard baseline to execute. Baselines can tell you how the server should be performing under normal workloads with the configuration that is currently in place.  

During this session we will look at the kinds of data that you should be collecting while spending the majority of our time reviewing the methods on how this data can be collected, stored, automated and reported on.

These standardized baselines will give you a head start the next time you are looking to upgrade your server to new hardware, recover a server and performance troubleshooting.
