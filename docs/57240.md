## Speaker: Darren Gosbell
## Title: Why your charts suck and how to fix them
## Abstract:
### Building effective data visualizations is an increasingly important skill. As data professionals the amount of data and the speed at which it is arriving is constantly growing. At the same time our business users are increasingly time poor in a world filled with distractions and shiny things. With social media, instant messaging, conference calls and emails if the message that you are trying to convey is not clear, engaging and easy to understand it will not get the attention that it deserves.

Clicking next, next, next, finish on a chart wizard is not the way to build engaging data visualizations.

In this presentation we will look at what you need to consider to build clear and engaging data visualizations and what pitfalls you should avoid.
