## Title: See the Future with SQL Running Totals - Never Run Out of Anything Again
## Abstract:
### Have you ever run out of something?  Do you need to order things now that you know will be needed by a certain date?  
This seemingly simple problem can get complicated, whether you are making a shopping list for a party, or doing supply chain planning for a factory.
Special functions in T-SQL and SSRS can help you build a visual model of future supply and demand, so you will know if all your bases are covered.
We will demonstrate algorithms for tracking running totals and check that they scale well to handle big data sets, and build a flexible report to answer "what if" scenarios.  Come learn how to use SQL Server tools to build a looking glass to the future!
