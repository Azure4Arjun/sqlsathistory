## Speaker: Matthew Roche
## Title: Introduction to Power BI dataflows
## Abstract:
### This fall Microsoft introduced Power BI dataflows, a powerful new feature for self-service data preparation powered by Azure Data Lake Storage gen2. Dataflows bring the familiar Power Query data prep experience to the Power BI service, and enable analysts and business users to define reusable data entities that can be shared and reused across workspaces and apps.

In this session, Power BI program manager Matthew Roche will introduce this exciting new capability, including an end-to-end demonstration of the Power BI dataflows experience. If you haven’t yet started to explore dataflows – or if you want to build on what you already know – this is the session for you.
