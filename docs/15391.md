## Abstract:
### Microsoft is looking to bring a brand new type of database for the OLTP systems â€“ in-memory, codename 'Hekaton'. Promising some of the before unseen speed improvements, the aim is to reach 100 times improvement over existing traditional OLTP performance. One of the most exciting and promising projects of the SQL Server history, Hekaton is a beginning of a new SQL Server era.
