## Title: Modern Data Modeling for Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL DW
## Abstract:
### The principles of dimensional modeling for data warehousing, especially the work of Dr. Ralph Kimball, have been enormously successful for many years. But are they still relevant to the world of data lakes and big data? And what is their role in a modern DW of a relational database, even massively parallel databases like Azure SQL DW? 
      
This presentation will explore when the concepts of dimensional modeling are still relevant to give value to your Data Lake and Big Data solutions and then cover the reason why a modern DW on Azure SQL DW is still needed. It will conclude with some implementation details of a Modern DW on Azure SQL DW, that relate to modeling including how to maximize performance by minimizing Data Movement (Shuffle Move and PartitionMove operations).
