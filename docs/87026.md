## Title: ETL is Dead; Long Live Streams with Apache Kafka.
## Abstract:
### Taras talks about the experience moving from batch-oriented ETL to real-time streams using Apache Kafka and how the design and implementation of Kafka was driven by this goal of acting as a real-time platform for event data.
