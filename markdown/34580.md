## Title: Build a monitoring system with Powershell Remoting
## Abstract:
### 
My last session on managing large environments turned out to be more talk than proof, it contained a bunch of war stories and almost no demos.
This session will be the other way around, we're going to spend most of our time in powershell and we'll build a whole monitoring system from scratch.
I'll use powershell remoting and real world demo's based on my own day to day practice.
To keep the promise of a level 300 session I'll spend some time in the beginning to explain the concepts of powershell remoting,
after which I'll build a monitoring system step by step in the second part of the session.
