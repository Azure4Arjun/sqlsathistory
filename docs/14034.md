## Title: SQL 2014 In Memory OLTP and Natively Compiled Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2014 one of the most talked about new features is the In Memory OLTP (project "Hekaton") and natively compiled stored procedures which promise to deliver dramatic performance increases.  But, is this new feature ready for prime time or another version one that should be avoided until the next release?  In this session we will look at how you implement memory optimized tables and compiled procedures, do some quick demos and comparisons to see what the hype is about, and examine some of the considerations and requirements.
