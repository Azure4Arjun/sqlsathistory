## Title: Self-Service ETL with Microsoft Power Query
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will introduce you to Microsoft's new self-service ETL tool "Power Query" for Excel.  I will show you, how to source data from various data sources, how you can massage the data and consume the data for your use in the data pipeline.  I will introduce you to "M" language that is used in Power Query.  I will show you how you can discover and mash data from public data sources within Power Query.  If you would like to do ETL quickly without writing SSIS packages, Power Query is the way go. Come and attend this session to learn "Power Query".
