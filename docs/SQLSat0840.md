## Speaker: Jay Falck
## Title: Introduction to Linux for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is now available on Linux but you only know Windows, now what? During this session we'll introduce the Linux version of Windows commands you use on a daily basis for administering SQL Server. We'll look at updating Linux, updating SQL Server, moving files between Windows and Linux, and backing up and restoring databases from one system to another. We'll also look at default file locations for SQL Server and what can be moved and how to accomplish that.

# Conan the Librarian: "Put your data sources into Azure Data Catalog, or ELSE!"
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-840)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Mike Diehl
## Title: Conan the Librarian: "Put your data sources into Azure Data Catalog, or ELSE!"
## Abstract:
### Are all the sources of data in your organization well documented and easily discovered? Can someone new to your organization find out who is the knowledge expert on your data sources? Is it clear who they should contact to request access to a data source? Do your data sources clearly describe their meaning? 
If you want to answer YES to all these questions, you should come to this session! 
We'll cover the basics of Azure Data Catalog - registering data sources, adding metadata and documentation, tags, and experts. And we'll discuss the scenarios that it is intended to address.

# Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-840)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
## Abstract:
### We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for worloads that are _mostly_ insert? Are they always recommended for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations? Does it help to create non-clustered indexes on top of heaps? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

# Managing and monitoring SQL Server on Linux from the command line

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Randolph West
## Title: Managing and monitoring SQL Server on Linux from the command line
## Abstract:
### When SQL Server arrived on Linux in 2017, Microsoft brought with it a database engine that works exactly the same as it does on Windows.

While you can manage and monitor SQL Server on Linux using existing tools designed for Windows, there are command line tools that will feel right at home to seasoned command-line and scripting veterans, including Oracle DBAs.

This session will cover mssql-conf (for configuring the server instance), mssql-cli (for connecting to the database engine), and dbfs (mounting a virtual file system) to query database management views (DMVs) using bash.

## Speaker: Chris C
## Title: Create a Time Travelling Database
## Abstract:
### You've created a table or two to store historical data but how about an entire database?  This talk will give you the tools the tools to create a temporal database using current and past relational databases. 
 Learn how to store and query temporal data but, more importantly, how to think about data as it changes over time.  Spoiler: it does not involve SQL Server's new Temporal Tables, data warehousing, etc.  It can all be done in your current database.

# Building a Modern Cloud Data Warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-840)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Dmitry Anoshin
## Title: Building a Modern Cloud Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Organizations treat data as an asset. They always look for ways to improve existing analytics solutions and extract information from terabytes and petabytes of data.

One of the recent trends is the migration from legacy DW platform to the Cloud Data Platform. During this journey, data engineers meet lots of challenges and sometimes try to reinvent the wheel.

This talk will cover the journey towards Modern Cloud Analytics Solutions with Microsoft Azure. Moreover, It will cover the ETL tool selection process for the Cloud as well as the adoption process for the end users. 

Finally, I will cover Big Data use case using Hadoop and Spark as well as Data Lake concept and idea.

This talk will help you understand the potential of Azure Cloud Analytics and learn about our use case and save time for future projects.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-840)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

# Untangling the spaghetti: Patterns and Anti-Patterns in SQL and ETL development
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-840)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Mike Diehl
## Title: Untangling the spaghetti: Patterns and Anti-Patterns in SQL and ETL development
## Abstract:
### Everyone has heard of "spaghetti code", but not many talk about "spaghetti data". Data environments grow over time, and often databases and servers become a tangled mess; if you had some pasta sauce, you could make lunch out of it! 
In this session I will show the most grievous bad practices, what sorts of problems and constrictions they cause, and how they can be re-written to achieve much looser coupling across all data in an enterprise. Any DBA or developer that uses more than two part table or view names in their queries or stored procedures should attend!

## Speaker: Brian Gale
## Title: Service Broker - for Good and ETL
## Abstract:
### This session will go over what is service broker, how does service broker work and how it can help with a near-realtime ETL process.
Service broker allows for asynchronous operations to occur on a database.  Using this, you can push data from your operational database to a data mart and provide users with near realtime access to live data without risking an impact on the live system with blocking or deadlocking.

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Sepand Gojgini
## Title: DW loves DevOps ??!!
## Abstract:
### Many organization spend months and potentially years designing and implementing their data warehouse and by time of delivery the business requirements have evolved. Moreover such system is very complex and making any changes requires large amount of regression testing which slows down making improvement to system. Many of these problems plagued traditional application development and have for the large part been addressed by adoption of agile methodology and DevOps practices. In this session we'll draw parallel between the challenges of both domain and what the solution may look like.
