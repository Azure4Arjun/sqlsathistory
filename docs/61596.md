## Title: The Power of Power Query  | Microsoft Dev Team
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Power Query started a revolution in self-service data transformation. First launched as an Excel add-in, this incredible product was soon integrated into Excel 2016, and became a core component of the wildly successful Power BI Desktop. This session provides an overview of the product, future integration plans, and a deep dive into the Power Query formula language. Weâ€™ll cover how to leverage some of the advanced features recently added to Power BI Desktop, such as function creation and query parameterization, and show you how to wrangle data like a pro.
