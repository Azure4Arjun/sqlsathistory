## Speaker: Kevin Goode
## Title: Embracing the CLR
## Abstract:
### When you mention CLR does your DBA run screaming from the room? Have you considered using the CLR but are intimidated by .Net and how foreign it seems compared to T-SQL? Have you ever thought that working with strings and dates in T-SQL is needlessly difficult and painful? This session will help demystify CLR integration, show you how to expose basic CLR functionality to your database, demonstrate how to get large performance gains from very little CLR code and give you the information and evidence you need to convince your DBA that the CLR is not inherently evil, and in the right circumstance, is the best solution to a problem
