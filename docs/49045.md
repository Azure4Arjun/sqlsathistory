## Title: Introducing Azure ML
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning is a point-and-click Software-as-a-Service offering on the Microsoft Azure platform. It allows data scientists to manage, cleanse, and filter data; train, score, and evaluate models; and write custom components in R and Python. Once the data scientist's work is done, Azure ML then automatically generates a production-ready web service to implement the model, saving significant development effort. This talk will walk through the Azure ML offerings and discuss how they may integrate into a mature business platform.
