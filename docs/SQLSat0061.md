# Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#61-DC-2010)
Event Date: 04-12-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jana Sattainathan
## Title: Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008
## Abstract:
### Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle. The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning. It is simple and efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.

# Processing Flat Files with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#61-DC-2010)
Event Date: 04-12-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
## Abstract:
### When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison!
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence solutions.
