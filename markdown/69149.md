## Title: Why is my DBA So Grump? Real Reasons Why Some Code Practices Cause Issues.
## Abstract:
### One of the interesting things about the SQL Server community is how often best practice advice that is widely knows and non-controversial is also widely ignored. Have most of us heard that using NOLOCK is bad? Yes, almost certainly. Does NOLOCK still get used heavily in production code? Yep, you betcha. Presumably the issue is not that we don't care whether or not code is written correctly ... we're all professionals and take pride in our work. It seems more likely that those responsible for the care and feeding of database servers haven't found the right way to explain _why_ some of these practices matter. Come hear Rick's attempts to explain why some code patterns are problematic. Topics covered will include NOLOCK, heaps, and cursors among others.
