## Title: Parent/Child Structures in SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services provides the ability to nest packages within one another in a parent/child structure.  By creating a multilayer package infrastructure using native elements of SSIS, you can easily encapsulate reusable components of your ETL layer, simplify logging, and make the development process more efficient.

In this session, we'll take a tour through parent/child design architecture within SSIS.  We'll discuss the advantages of using the parent/child architecture while reviewing various design patterns.  We'll review the capabilities within the various versions of SSIS (2005 through 2014) and discuss the buttons and switches that make it work.  Finally, we'll have a number of realistic demonstrations to fully illustrate these concepts.
