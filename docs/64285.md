## Title: SANLess clustering for physical, virtual and cloud environments
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Clusters and Datacenter MVP, Dave Bermingham, will discuss how to create SANLess clusters in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible. He will be discussing high performance clusters leveraging SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage for faster SQL application response times - no SAN (or SAN Admin required). He will also touch on methods for providing HA protection and native Windows Failover Clustering in Windows Azure or the Amazon Cloud. -- Topics covered -- High performance storage and accelerating SQL Server without sacrificing availability; AlwaysOn Failover Clustering vs. AlwaysOn Availability Groups; HA and DR strategy for SQL Server in Amazon EC2 and Azure instances; Fast, cost-effective strategies to get HA and DR protection without a SAN.
