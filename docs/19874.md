## Speaker: Matt Velic
## Title: Communicate for Great Good!
## Abstract:
### “No one knows what I do.” That’s a chief complaint of data professionals everywhere, and it’s a dangerous position to be in as well. Reviews may not be favorable, promotions more uncommon, and training dollars more rare. But by practicing written and verbal communication, new opportunities may present themselves. Blogging can land a book deal. In-house team lunch-and-learns can lead to community presentations. Most of all, good communication can be the skill that saves your job or opens the door to new horizons.
