## Title: Azure for the SQL Server DBA: What we need to know, and how to get started
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has shipped with features that integrate Azure since 2008 R2. Fast forward to 2016 and we have seen plenty of development from Microsoft in the cloud arena. As our IT landscape evolves in support of cloud-based computing, this technology will slowly but surely become more integrated into the life of a DBA. In this session we explore what Azure means for your applications, how to identify good candidates for the cloud, and how to build your Azure knowledge FAST.
