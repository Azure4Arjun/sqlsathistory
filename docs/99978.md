## Title: From AI to BI, how to do it all in Azure Synapse Analytics
## Abstract:
### Azure Synapse was just announced at Microsoft Ignite and PASS Summit in November 2019. It aims to join the two large requirements of the evolving data world - relational data and big data. To fully unleash the power behind your data, you need to be able to leverage both these types of data and apply machine learning and business intelligence on top of it. Azure Synapse combines ingestion, preparation and analytical capabilities with Azure Machine Learning and PowerBI.

Join me in a session to walk through what an end to end solution might look like for you in this brand new product. We will go through how Synapse enables you to prep the data, train models and generate reports without having to leave the workspace. You will leave with a better understanding of the product, it's capabilities and guiding principles on using it.
