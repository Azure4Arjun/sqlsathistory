## Title: Up Your Game With OUTPUT
## Abstract:
### There are some classic database programming tasks that rely on answering the question "What did I just change?" Prior to SQL Server 2005, we had to use functions like SCOPE_IDENTITY() and some extra tricks for handling multiple rows. Some people even had to resort to triggers. Yikes!! This session focuses on the practical use cases for the T-SQL OUTPUT clause. More importantly, you will find out how you can ditch the tricks of the past for a simpler solution that will help keep you sane.
