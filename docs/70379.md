## Title: Back to the Future with Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Back to the Future is the greatest time travel movie ever. I'll show you how temporal tables work, in both SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, without needing a DeLorean. We cover point in time analysis, reconstructing state at any time in the past, recovering from accidental data loss, calculating trends, and my personal favourite: auditing. There's even a bit of In-Memory OLTP. There might even be time for demos!
