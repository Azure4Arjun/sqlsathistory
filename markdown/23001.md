## Title: Introducing SQL Server Data Tools. (Project Juneau
## Abstract:
### Your final scripts deployed to the live database a few months ago and almost everything went perfectly. Since then you have heard there were few index patches needed maybe even a new column in one or the tables. The live database has drifted just a little from your deployed SQL scripts. How would you like to update your next baseline code to already resemble the current state of the production database? This is just one of the incredible features you can do with SSDT. Take the statefull nature of your database to create and test your code automatically and declaratively. Database developers can use the SQL Server Object Explorer in VS to easily. See how the new scripting and automation tools are used in SQL 2012 with SSDT.
