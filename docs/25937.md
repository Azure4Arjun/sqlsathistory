## Title: Advanced Statistics Management: Setting Up SQL Server For Success
## Abstract:
### The optimizer uses statistics to generate a cardinality estimate which, in turn, affects query plan decisions as well as system resources. In this session we're going to step through the process of evaluating the statistics present (or not present) and present a methodology for analyzing the presence of skew, candidate filtered statistics, and their efficacy in an environment. Additionally, we'll look at the impacts of the new Cardinality Estimator in SQL Server 2014 on plan generation This would, ultimately, be an excellent addition to any periodic SQL Server health check.
