## Speaker: Doug Brendle
## Title: What is this cache and how did it get so big?
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what's in your SQL Plan cache? Wonder why or how the plan cache got so big? This session will cover what the cache is, how it is used, and how poor application and query design can make it worse. Rather than put participants to sleep with dozens of slides we will get down and dirty with lots of demos including .Net code and some cool DMVs to guide the way.
