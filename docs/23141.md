## Title: Process Automation with SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll use SSIS in a real-world example to automate processes. We'll look at using Variables and Expressions. We'll look at several items in the Control Flow that can be used to automate a lot of integration processes. We'll import data from MS Excel, save it to a database, export aggregated data into a different format, archive the data source, zip the data source, encrypt the exported file, and submit it via SFTP or email.
