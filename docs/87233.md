## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### One of the most significant announcements in SQL Server history came in September 2018; the addition of SQL Server Big Data Clusters to the 2019 release. Combining big data tools such as HDFS and Spark with SQL Server into a single platform has tremendous potential. The change to platform architecture and administration, however, is extensive. In this session we we review the capabilities enabled by Big Data Clusters and become familiar with some necessary technologies that may be new to many, such as Kubernetes.  Most of the time will be spent in demos of how the platform works.
