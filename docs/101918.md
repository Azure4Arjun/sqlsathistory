## Title: Using tSQLt unit testing with SSDT Database Projects
## Abstract:
### Unit testing is a key part of a DevOps process that helps to improve code quality (and increase your confidence). 

Using tSQLt, a unit testing framework for SQL Server databases, you can create "mock" tables that contain test data and have powerful comparison assertions to validate your merge logic for more complex data change scenarios - beyond simple Type I and Type II Slowly Changing Dimensions. 

This session will show how to write basic unit tests for a data warehouse/mart project, with a focus on unit tests for stored procedures that merge staging tables to dimensional and fact tables. 

In this session we'll also see how to structure your database projects in Visual Studio (SQL Server Data Tools) to separate your test code from your database structures and the unit test framework (in this case, tSQLt).
