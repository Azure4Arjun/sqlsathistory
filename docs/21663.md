## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: Best Practices Document
## Abstract:
### As DBAs we are often straddled with writing a best practices document. In this session, I will start with a bare bones template and then we can collectively come up with a Best Practices Document by the end of the session. I challenge you that this document can come in handy, no matter where you go.If time permits, we can also discuss how to implement this in organizations with varying degrees of acceptance.
