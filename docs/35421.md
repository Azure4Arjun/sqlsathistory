## Title: Scalable SQL Server Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Learn how Hyper-V can provide on-demand scalability and improved resource utilization specifically for the unique SQL Server workload characteristics. We will discuss how to use Resource Governor to guarantee predictable performance, as well as, how to automate the allocation of resources based on the servers current performance, and how to contain problem processes. Finally, we will discuss how the Data Collector can be used to provide constant information about the health of the cloud to itself and to the DBA. Throughout the session, we will demonstrate how these ideas work together to create a new SQL Server infrastructure that will change as your needs change.
