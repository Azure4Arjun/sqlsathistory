## Title: #03 | An introduction to data analysis with R
## Abstract:
### The R language is one of the key programming languages used in Azure Machine Learning. During this session we will introduce the basic programming constructs of the language and get you started on the road to detailed data analysis. We describe the language, data structures and libraries used in R development and show how your completed code can be deployed to a Azure Machine Language environment and executed through the web API. At the completion of this session, you may not be an R hotshot, but you will hopefully have accelerated your journey toward becoming one.
