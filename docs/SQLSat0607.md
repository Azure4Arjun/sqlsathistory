## Title: Secrets of SQL Server - Database Worst Practices
## Abstract:
### “OMG! What did I do?” Chances are you have heard, or even uttered, this expression. This demo-oriented session will show many examples where database professionals were dumbfounded by their own mistakes, and could even bring back memories of your own early DBA days. The goal of this session is to expose the small details that can be dangerous to the production environment and SQL Server as a whole, as well as talk about worst practices and how to avoid them. In this session we will focus on some of the common errors and their resolution. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.

## Speaker: Ron Huizenga
## Title: Using Models as the Blueprints for Enterprise Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Data governance is becoming increasingly important to corporations who must demonstrate compliance to industry and corporate regulations. This is occurring against a backdrop of continuously evolving technology, an explosion of diverse data sources, and exponential growth in volume. Data professionals are tasked with ensuring data quality, enforcing data security, tracking model changes, and complying with audits. We will discuss a practical, model-based approach to enterprise data governance, with a focus on Master Data Management (MDM).

## Title: Performance in 60 Seconds - SQL Tricks Everybody MUST Know
## Abstract:
### Data and Database is a very important aspect of application development for businesses. Developers often come across situations where they face a slow server response, even though their hardware specifications are above par. This session is for all the Developers who want their server to perform at blazing fast speed, but want to invest very little time to make it happen. We will go over various database tricks which require absolutely no time to master and require practically no SQL coding at all. After attending this session, Developers will only need 60 seconds to improve performance of their database server in their implementation. We will have a quiz during the session to keep the conversation alive. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.

## Title: Power BI for the Faint of Heart - Building an Interactive Report Step-by-Step!
## Abstract:
### You've heard about Power BI, and you've seen it, but you haven't yet rolled up your sleeves and got your hands dirty. It looks like it is really easy, but sometimes it helps to have someone step you through it the first time to help you hit the ground running. We will grab various public data sources, join them together in a model and build an interactive pièce de ré·sis·tance on the visual design surface!

# Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server

## Speaker: Sebastian Meine
## Title: Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.
