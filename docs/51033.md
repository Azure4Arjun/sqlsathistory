## Title: Connect your Shack: Building a Poor Man's IoT
## Abstract:
### Azure IoT is here, and here's one thing MS has done very well: the integration with Azure Service Bus, Event Hub and Power BI. In this session, we start with a high-level overview of IoT  stuff (protocols, mesh networks, sensors, etc.) and discuss architecture of an IoT solution. Finally, we'll look at a small Proof of Concept I've built to connect my home without spending too much: the "Poor Man's IoT".
