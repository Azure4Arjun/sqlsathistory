## Title: How To Give a Technical Presentation
## Abstract:
### Most people don't like to speak in public and technical folks are certainly no exception.  Yet, you've got some ideas for a great presentation but just don't know how to go about putting it all together.  On top of that, how do you go about giving the presentation itself?  This session will cover how to pull your material together in an organized fashion and present it such that your audience can follow along and get the message you want to relay.  We'll also discuss how to deal with issues that cause presenters stress to help you to make the process enjoyable and rewarding for all.
