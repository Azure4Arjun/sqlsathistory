## Title: Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Although SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Azure Data Factory (ADF) are both used for data management processes in the Microsoft Data Platform, they are rather different tools. SSIS performs data transformation and requires a SQL Agent job or another application to schedule and execute it. ADF is an orchestration tool rather than a data transformation tool, and it has built-in scheduling capabilities. I'll explain the basics of Azure Data Factory, show how it is and isn't like SSIS, and share lessons learned from ADF projects I have completed.
