## Title: Overlord - tracking changes real-time, in your environment
## Abstract:
### Don’t you LOVE it when changes are made to your databases without notice!?  Those AWESOME “Object doesn't exist” messages, sudden performance problems, failed audits and other unexpected errors can be soooo much fun!  Time to put an end to these unreported changes and get real-time notice as they occur, via emails, reports, or even Source Control.  Learn to use Event Notifications, a native SQL Server feature, along with some production-ready code. to become the Overlord your users need.
