## Title: Assimilating Microsoft Access -- Upsizing to SQL Server
## Abstract:
### DBAs agree, Access databases should be converted to SQL Server, but that sounds a lot easier than it turns out to be in most cases. In this session we will discuss when it is appropriate to migrate to SQL Server, migration strategies, how to manage the transition, whether to move to on premises or Azure and finally how to accomplish the task.
