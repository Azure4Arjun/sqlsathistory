## Title: SQL Server and JSON in real applications
## Abstract:
### JSON support that was introduced in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database enables you to get the best both from relational and NoSQL worlds. You can easily combine relational design that provides high query performance and non-relational concepts that provide you flexibility and rapid development to create optimal design for your application.
In this session, we will see how you can combine relational data and JSON, query and index JSON data, load semi-structured data from log files, create REST/OData services, and easily integrate your database with modern web apps.
