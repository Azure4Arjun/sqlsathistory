## Title: "Ad Hoc Analytics – Can my customer do that?”
## Abstract:
### In a customer service based business world the newest feature being offered to clients in many industries is access to their data for ad hoc analytics.  Agile players in many industries are stealing away market share because of this additional feature they can offer and in turn is forcing big players in every industry to just keep up to hold their ground.  SQL Server 2012 will be in the middle of this battle and will give us the ability to deliver this feature without building the entire system from scratch.  This feature is brought to us by using the new Power View and Business Intelligence Semantic Model all surfaced using SharePoint 2010.
