## Speaker: Steven Wright
## Title: The Shade Tree Mechanic's Guide to SSAS
## Abstract:
### This is a session for the SQL DBA that has SSAS in their environment, but is not sure what happens under the hood when it queried, much less how to tell if it's performing at its best.  This is not a session on query optimization.  But, this session will help you better understand if there is room for query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed boost.  We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance.
