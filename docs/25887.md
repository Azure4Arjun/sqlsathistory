## Speaker: Susan Rickman
## Title: Can't we all just get along?
## Abstract:
### There comes a point in every career that you will need to talk to people that you do not agree with.  It is important to advancement (and well-being) that you are able to make concise points that will draw interest from other teams, as opposed to alienating them.  
How do you speak to your leadership team?  Your peers?  People who depend on you?  People on whom you depend?
