## Title: Introduction to Agile
## Abstract:
### Agile software development is more than frameworks such as Scrum, Extreme Programming or Feature-Driven Development (FDD).

Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it's generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context.

Join us to learn how to apply this principles in real day to day activities.
