## Speaker: Marcelo Fernandes
## Title: High availability for SQL Server using Azure as DR site
## Abstract:
### In this session we will present the union of the local environment and the cloud and show the integration between these environments. The cloud is already a reality and we still have several environments that must remain in local environments due to legislation or company rules. In this session you will see that it is possible to maintain both environments.
