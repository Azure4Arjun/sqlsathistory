## Title: Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics
## Abstract:
### Since SQL Server 2000 we have had the ability to collect statistics on two key areas in terms of performance directly from within SQL Server.  More specifically these are the File  Wait statistics and the information that can be gleaned from these has increased dramatically with each new release. SQL 2008 currently has over 480 events so far. This session will show you how to efficiently capture and analyze the information provided by a set of DMVâ€™s in SQL Server 2005  SQL Server 2008. This knowledge will dramatically decrease the amount of time spent looking for bottlenecks in your system.
