## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: 101 BI and AI
## Abstract:
### How does the AI make my BI applications smarter?

How can the AI make my BI application smarter? Everybody is talking about AI but what can you do with it today? Currently there are tools like the Cognitive Services, Azure ML or Azure Bot Framework, which can help in the classic ETL process to prepare or enrich data. Examples are the analysis of large data streams from the IoT area, how can I improve my demand planning of a call center or the analysis of social media regarding trends.
If you already have your BI application in the cloud, Azure Data Factory, Logic App or Azure Stream Analytics would be the right components for an AI extension.

## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: Not just polish – How good code also runs faster
## Abstract:
### I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.

## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Making Managed Instance Perform, a dive into storage.
## Abstract:
### Moving to the cloud means that we need to take a different approach when it comes to how we design and tune databases. Managed Instance is a case in point, get the storage configuration wrong and it will not perform. Together we will look at the storage options and architecture for Managed Instance before demonstrating how to get tune the storage layer to get the performance we need. Of course none of this is any use without knowing what level of performance you need so we will look at how you can get this information before you start testing.

## Speaker: Vedran Kesegic
## Title: SQL Server Magic Show
## Abstract:
### The most beautiful and fun way to get know the depths of SQL Server is through magic. You will see a series of SQL Server experiments that look like a trick or illusion. But they are not. It is just exploiting the deep knowledge of how SQL works. This will deepen your knowledge and increase ability to solve real-world challenges.
The tricks:
Select count(*) from table - returns wrong count (any # you like)
Deadlock - single statement, without transactions
Database - without files
Online index changes - on Standard edition
Reading plaintext data of TDE-encrypted database - without SQL access

## Speaker: Jani K. Savolainen
## Title: Monitoring Mission-critical SQL Servers: How to utilize alerting to predict system bottlenecks
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will deep-dive into the ocean of SQL Server monitoring alerts in large-scale and mission critical systems, from basic alerting and baselines into alerts assisted by machine learning. SQL Servers have dozens of important performance counters that DBA’s should follow on server, instance, and database level. It is practically impossible to monitor all of these performance counters over time without a proper alerting strategy, methodology, and implementation. How to maximize your uptime? How to avoid unplanned unavailability situations?

This session goes through 10 different pain points in SQL Server monitoring and covers the ideology and mechanisms on why, how and when to utilize alerts.

# T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-852)
Event Date: 11-05-2019 - Session time: 12:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing
## Abstract:
### This session aims to explore all the features offered by the language T-SQL for aggregating and calculating data. There's much more of the clause GROUP BY.
With grouping and ranking functions you can calculate in your query grandtotal, running totals, find islands in intervals, select the last-not-null value, etc.
Windows functions apply directly on a set of rows defined by the OVER clause ("a window"). Windows function do not perform aggregation on group level and do not hide row details.
So they allow mixing detail and total elements in the same query.
The session is mainly based on a copious array of demos, to make explicit every concept introduced taking into account the impact on performances for every solution.

# Failure prediction for manufacturing industry with SQL Server  R
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-852)
Event Date: 11-05-2019 - Session time: 13:40:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: Failure prediction for manufacturing industry with SQL Server  R
## Abstract:
### Working in manufacturing industry means that you must deal with product failures. As a BI and/or Data Scientist developer, your task is not only monitor and report product’s health state during its lifecycle, but also predict the likelihood of a fail in the production phase or when product has been delivered to the customer. 
Machine Learning techniques can help us to accomplish this task.  Starting from past failure data, we can build up a predictive model to forecast the likelihood for a product to fail or giving an estimate on its duration. And now it is possible to develop an end-to-end solution in SQL Server, because of the introduction of advanced analytics tools like R since release 2016. 
In this session, we start from the real case of a manufacturing company to create some predictive models: a) Regression model ; b) binary and multivariate models. 
Binary or multi-class classification problem. Some reports are also created to deliver the outcome to the stakeholders.

## Speaker: Ola Hallengren
## Title: Analyzing Performance Problems Using XEvents, DMVs  Query Store
## Abstract:
### Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views, and Query Store are highly useful tools that give you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to correlate the data.

You are troubleshooting a performance problem in a business-critical database, a query is not completing, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from Extended Events, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session, we will look at how the tools work in different scenarios, how to correlate the data, and how you can use them in your performance troubleshooting.

Event Date: 11-05-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.

## Speaker: Zhenbo Zhang
## Title: Mondern Data Lake - Foundation for Advanced Analytics and Busines
## Abstract:
### Data lake concept has evolved a lot recent years. Traditionally, data lake is used interchangeably with Hadoop. In Hadoop data and compute are co-located to reduce data transfer latency, thus improving the  performance. However, in Cloud era, data lake concept is dramatically evolved. Nowadays in cloud, compute nodes and data storage are normally decoupled, which brings significant benefit for scalability, cost optimization, upgradability etc. Modern cloud data ecosystem is all built upon this concept. The data lake storage is the foundation for most of the Azure data services, e.g. data factory, databricks, Azure datawarehouse, PowerBI. The concept of common data model enables business application and Azure services to work with same data in Azure data lake storage and makes different roles in organization e.g. data engineer, data scientists, business analysts to work in a much more seamless way.
