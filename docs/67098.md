## Title: DevOps for the DBA
## Abstract:
### DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.
