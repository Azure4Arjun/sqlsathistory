## Title: Modeling Hierarchies in SQL
## Abstract:
### The dictionary defines a hierarchy as “any system of persons or things ranked one above another.” Classic examples that you may want to model in a database are an org chart or a bill of materials.  A less well-behaved example is the dependency of database objects (sysdepends).  These examples will be used to explain HIERARCHYID, recursive CTE (Common Table Expressions) and the Adjacency List Model.
