# ETL meets Azure
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: ETL meets Azure
## Abstract:
### How to move the classic SSIS packages to the cloud for the ETL process? Azure offers Data Factory, Runbooks, Logic App, or Functions. What is hidden behind the individual services and what can I do with them? The examples here show how these components can be assembled to manage a DWH's management in the cloud.

# Investigate, analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Investigate, analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

# Database version control  deployment: model or migration scripts
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: Database version control  deployment: model or migration scripts
## Abstract:
### For the last few years MS have been promoting declarative, model-based database development with tools like SSDT. For many this is the way forward – gone are the days of managing endless upgrade scripts and manual deployments.
 
At the same time, leaders and shakers of our industry including ThoughtWorks, Pramod Sadalge and Paul Stovell promote an iterative, migration script driven approach asserting that deployment scripts should be tested early and not generated by a tool.
 
I'm irritated whenever I go to a "how to do database continuous delivery" session and the speaker presents one way as good and the other as bad. Like most things, it depends.
 
I'll illustrate the limitations of each approach with a simple scenario. I'll describe which projects are better suited to a model or a migrations approach, and whether it's possible to get the best of both worlds

# Power BI deployment strategy for publishing and maintenance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Prathy Kamasani
## Title: Power BI deployment strategy for publishing and maintenance
## Abstract:
### Power BI: Minutes to create and seconds to impress. 

Yes, it takes minutes to create and share Power BI reports. Which means every user who has relevant Power BI access can create Workspaces, Apps, reports, dashboards and schedules. With no deployment strategy, maintaining Power BI service could become a terrible job. 
In this session, I will cover how having a having deployment strategy can make a terrible maintenance job seamless.

This session will include:
What happens when a user creates a Power BI app workspace
How to control user access
Working with different environments
Creating and sharing reports using Power BI Apps 
How to monitor dataset schedules and failure notifications
How to use Power BI API to document your organisation Power BI Service

# Data Types Do Matter
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Angela Henry
## Title: Data Types Do Matter
## Abstract:
### They're just numbers, right?  A date's a date.  It's just string data, who cares?  I can't tell you how many times I've heard these phrases.  This session will help you understand why choosing the correct data type for your data is so important.  It affects data quality, storage and performance.  It can even produce incorrect query results.

## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: Hybrid BI DevOps
## Abstract:
### In this session we are going to build a DevOps framework for Azure Data Factory, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, Power BI Report Server and for the databases used within the entire ETL/DW process. 
We use Visual Studio Online for source control, development and integration. Development changes are automatically deployed to on-premises or the Cloud using SQL Server, Azure SQL Databases, Azure VMs and Azure Data Factory v2. We will show how we can build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline between environments, pushing the schema changes and upgrading the version numbers in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solutions. Furthermore we'll come with a list of best practices to follow and pitfalls to avoid when going down the DevOps road.

# Tuning optional filters
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Vedran Kesegic
## Title: Tuning optional filters
## Abstract:
### "Catch-all" queries are very common, found in nearly every database. You know those "give me a row with this @ID or give me all rows if @ID is -1"? That is an optional filter, and probably you have a combination of multiple. Tuning them is a nightmare that sometimes even professionals fail to solve completely. Such queries are sometimes fast and suddenly get slow without apparent reason, bringing server to its knees if often executed. You will see the secret mastery and wizardry of achieving the best possible performance for those queries, and understand internals of SQL Server deeper than before. Bringing your company huge benefits in smooth databases performance and increase your customers' satisfaction.

# SQL 2017 New feature - Graph Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: David Postlethwaite
## Title: SQL 2017 New feature - Graph Data
## Abstract:
### When I read that Microsoft have added graph data to SQL Server 2017 I was intrigued as to what graph data is so I started doing some research.
This presentation is the culmination of my investigations. 
If you design complex OLTP relational databases or have data that doesn't fit the rigid hierarchy of a relational database then this talk is for you. 
You may be in for a surprise!

Some of the questions we will look at:
What is Graph Data?
Who uses it?
What is it used for?
How does it compare to traditional relational database design?
What other companies support graph databases?
How does it work in SQL 2017?
Is there a new language to learn?
What is the so-called Kevin Bacon problem?

And finally.
Will it replace traditional relational database design within the next 10 years?

# Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
## Abstract:
### Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store  Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.

# Boring is stable, stable is good - best practices in practice
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Boring is stable, stable is good - best practices in practice
## Abstract:
### Everybody is talking about best practices, and like standards, most everybody has them. But why do they look like they do, and why would you use a specific set of "best practices" that someone has put together? This session goes through my set of best practices that I've accumulated over 20 years of DBA work, disassembles each and every one of them to see how they came about and discusses why I still use them - or don't. There is no such thing as the ultimate best practices, but I aim to provide the attendee with as much food for thought as possible in order to let each and everyone decide on their own path forward for their own set of best practices.
The session covers primarily SQL Server 2012 to 2016, with SQL Server 2017 thrown in for good measure.

# Temporal Data in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#704---Iceland-2018)
Event Date: 10-03-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Temporal Data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Databases that serve business applications should often support temporal data. For example, suppose a contract with a supplier is valid for a limited time only. It can be valid from a specific point in time onward, or it can be valid for a specific time interval—from a starting time point to an ending time point. In addition, many times you need to audit all changes in one or more tables. You might also need to be able to show the state in a specific point in time, or all changes made to a table in a specific period of time. From the data integrity perspective, you might need to implement many additional temporal specific constraints.
This session introduces the temporal problems, deals with solutions that go beyond SQL Server 2016 and 2017 support, and shows out-of-the-box solution in SQL Server 2016 and 2017, including:
•	Defining temporal data
•	Application versioned tables
•	System versioned tables
•	What kind of temporal support is still missing
