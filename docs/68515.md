## Title: Design Seamless Upgrades to SQL Server 2017 with Query Store
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest fears most customers have is upgrading to a new release of Microsoft SQL Server and having performance degrade, because of changes in query execution plans. SQL Server 2016 mitigated this risk by the introduction of the Query Store and the ability to easily force execution plans.

In this session, you will learn about the data that the query store captures to identify queries that have regressed. You will learn about patterns for upgrades that allow you to upgrade with minimal impact to user performance. You will see demos of how to identify when a query has regressed in either plan or performance, and you will get some hints for the future of the Query Store with Adaptive Plans in SQL Server 2017.
