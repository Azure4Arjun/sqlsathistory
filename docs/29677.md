## Title: Excel 2010: everyman's OLAP client just got better
## Abstract:
### Starting with Excel 2000, pivot tables have been able to use OLAP cubes as data sources. Since then, Excel has become the most widely adopted OLAP BI client tool for Analysis Services cubes. And new OLAP functionality has been introduced with each successive version of Excel. In this session we'll review Excel OLAP client functionality, survey what's new in Excel 2010 - and see how it all works with Analysis Services 2008 R2.
