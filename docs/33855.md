## Title: Contained DB?  Did it do something wrong?
## Abstract:
### Imagine an environment where moving a database from a SQL Instance to another is as simple as just restoring the database. (Yes, no other steps!) SQL Server 2012 RC0 now supports Partial Contained databases.  We will cover the different levels of containment, configuring SQL Server to support it, and much more (i.e. Demos).
