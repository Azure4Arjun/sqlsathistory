## Title: Notes on Linked Servers
## Abstract:
### Did you know that permission can have a profound impact on performance? Did you know that sometimes it's better to move data to the logic and other times it's better to move the logic to data? Did you know that it can make a huge performance difference whether you push data or pull data across the servers? The common thread among these questions is linked servers. Because of the convenience they provide in moving data around on the server side, linked servers are used in almost all the SQL Server environments, and are often abused in many. This session focuses on a series of linked server cases--primarily performance related cases--encountered in in the real world to help reveal traps and highlight best practices.
