## Abstract:
### Power BI provides analytics solutions for your whole organization. Small Businesses can profit by exposing their data, and see the impact in their clients sites.

It's clients portal and the test data as other insights and recommendations, can be viewed by the clients using SharePoint 365. Performance dashboards are displayed using PowerBI, giving the business the opportunity for efficient decision making. The demo was built without code, every ITPro can do it!.
