## Title: Getting started with Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning is a managed service that integrates services together for a full end-to-end machine learning solution. Azure ML enables Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Business Users faster development, deployment, and access to machine learning models. Services available for each role include zero-code/low-code designer, Python, R, Databricks, Azure Kubernetes Service, and many more. Workspaces keep assets and artifacts in one place for easy management. Models can be developed locally, trained in Azure, and deployed to any device or environment. In this session, we will cover the built-in tools of the service and see an end-to-end solution for a simple machine learning model.
