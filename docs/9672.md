## Title: Faster  Stored Procedures and Functions
## Abstract:
### Stored procedures and functions are the mainstay of SQL Server coding. This presentation will show techniques to improve their performance.  We’ll start with techniques to learn where the time is really going using standard server traces and the new Extended Events.  Once we know where the time is going we look at strategies to decrease it:
•	Managing indexes on temp tables
   -	Why heaps are often the best choice for temp tables
   -	How building non-clustered indexes on heaps is faster than building clustered indexes.
•	Rewriting scalar and multi-statement functions to as inline functions
Each technique is illustrated with examples drawn from real cases in Andy's work.
