## Title: DBA vs ORM: Strategies for Data in a Code Focused 
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released LINQ, LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, and ADO.NET Data Services (Astoria) that are a few of many technologies that have dramatically changed how developers think about accessing data. This gives code-focused data access a big endorsement, but what implications exist for the data?  How is authentication/authorization handled?  Is performance good and how does optimization fit into the approach? This session will give an overview of the mechanics of how the technologies work, the pros/cons with the solutions produced, and include a frank discussion of the associated political struggles that may be created from ignorance and improper optimizations.
