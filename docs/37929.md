## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Common T-SQL Coding Mistakes and how to Mitigate them
## Abstract:
### Just because you can do it, does not mean that you should.

There are several programming design patterns that work great in object orientated code that do not scale well inside of SQL Server. 

In this session we will focus some of these patterns and show you how to make them scale in the database engine. We will touch on Scalar-Value functions, Union, CTE, RBAR and more.
