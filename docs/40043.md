## Title: How to Hack a Database
## Abstract:
### Do you ever hear about a database hack and think “Wow, whoever pulled this off must be some super-smart hacker type with access to advanced technology and supercomputers?” Well in reality nothing could be further from the truth. Database hacks are accomplished with a combination of readily available tools, a dash of readily available know-how, a large helping of blind luck, and a heaping helping of laziness on the part of the folks who are responsible for securing their systems. It's so easy even I can do it!

In this presentation I will teach you how to hack a database so you can defend your systems against the hackers who want to get at your assets.
