In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!
