## Title: Critical Path SQL
## Abstract:
### Critical path SQL will focus on recursive common table expressions (CTE) on problem solving in finding minimum and maximums for common business problems like minimum/maximum manufacturing costs and lead times in BOM's (bill of materials) and other hierarchical data structures where a tree traversal is needed as well as non-hierarchal data structure examining CTE usage with the traveling salesman problem to examine a desired minimum.
