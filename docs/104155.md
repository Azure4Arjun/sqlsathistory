## Title: Exploring the ‘people’ element of a Power BI project – its more than just data!!
## Abstract:
### Have you ever worked on a dashboard design project where you have been restricted by rules or direction that limit your capacity to create? Or developed a dashboard so awesome and compelling, only to have your manager or client start picking holes in it? If this sounds familiar, then come along to this Power BI session to hear about ways to effectively present and communicate your data by focusing on techniques you can use during the project to meet your objective first time, and reduce the need for re-work. I’ll present Power BI features and techniques that we use at DiscoverEI so that we can work WITH our clients, rather than working FOR our clients. These include how to enhance navigation and context through bookmarks and tooltips, using placeholder visuals to guide direction, utilising the App Workspace and communicating effectively through visual design.
