## Title: Introduction to Indexes
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll look at  design considerations for clustered and non-clustered indexes. We'll investigate what makes an index useful to SQL Server and what common mistakes make indexes useless. We'll go into the details of how various query predicates interact with indexes and what the primary driver is when designing indexes for any database application.

This session is aimed at people who are relatively new to indexing.
