## Title: The What, Why, and How of Filegroups 
## Abstract:
### Having multiple database files and filegroups is one of many strategies to improve performance and make administration easier. What are filegroups, and how do you use them? In this session, I'll show you how to create filegroups, create objects in them or move objects to them, and discuss how they can help performance. I'll also cover Enterprise-level features like piecemeal restores.
