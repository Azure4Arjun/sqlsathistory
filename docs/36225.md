## Title: Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is made up of a lot of objects in different environments.  When you create an object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed into each environment.  Together we will discover how to separate each object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable deployment and version control process.
