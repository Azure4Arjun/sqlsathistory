## Title: A practical guide to Windows Azure SQL Database for the DBA
## Abstract:
### What is "Windows Azure SQL Database" all about ? What does this mean for me as a DBA ? What is the process for setting up a Windows Azure database ? How would I go about migrating one of my databases to "The Cloud" ? How do I possibly leverage this new technology in my production environment ? 
If you are a production DBA and have contemplated one or more of these questions, this session is for you! Maybe, you have been tasked with finding out about "The Cloud". Join me in exploring the cloud where I will show you how SQL Server works in the Windows Azure SQL Database world. We will run through the simple process of configuring a Windows Azure SQL database. We will investigate the similarities and differences between on premises SQL Server and Windows Azure SQL Databases. We will even look into the DR, HA, monitoring and performance tuning options available with Windows Azure.
