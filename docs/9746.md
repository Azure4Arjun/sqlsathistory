## Title: So you think MDX is hard?
## Abstract:
### A lot of people have this perception that MDX is difficult. It really isn't, when you understand what it is trying to accomplish under the hood. In this session we'll begin with a fundamental understanding of what MDX will do for you. Then we'll roll up our sleeves and dive into MDX code, starting from the simplest select statement and winding up building calculations you can put into your own SSAS Cubes.
