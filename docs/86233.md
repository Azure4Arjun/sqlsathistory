## Title: Why Should I Care About SQL if I Have ORM?
## Abstract:
### Ok, we are starting a new project. Platform: .Net. Programming language: C#. Database: SQL Server. How will we work with the database? ORM. Most likely Entity Framework. Time to start! Unfortunately, this set is already enough to start the project, but not enough for its efficient and painless work in the production environment. In this session, we will talk about the dangers and treasures which are hidden in the bowels of the ORM and how you can try to protect yourself and your project from them.
