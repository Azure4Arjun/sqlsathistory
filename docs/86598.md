## Title: SQL Server Query Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### You identified a query that is causing performance issues, and your mission is to optimize it and boost performance. You looked at the execution plan and created all the relevant indexes. You even updated statistics, but performance is still bad. Now what?
In this pre-conference session we will analyze common use cases of poorly performing queries, such as the improper use of scalar functions, inaccurate statistics and bad impact of parameter sniffing. We will learn through extensive demos how to troubleshoot these use cases and how to boost performance using advanced and practical techniques.
The topics in this session are relevant for SQL Server versions 2005 through 2017. We will also demonstrate some of the new features introduced in the latest versions of SQL Server, such as Adaptive Query Processing. At the end of the session, you'll have a list of tips and techniques to apply in your environment.
