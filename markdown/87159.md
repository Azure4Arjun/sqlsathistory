## Title: Functions and Parameters in Power BI
## Abstract:
### There are situations in an analyst's life when you have to repeat same list of actions on a little bit different dataset. On the other hand, software development experience tells us to avoid repeating code which was already written and to convert it into procedure or function. On the example of public data and Google Analytics I'll show you how to group your actions in order to simplify data preparing processes.
