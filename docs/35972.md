## Title: Execution Plans 101
## Abstract:
### Do you have a query that you want to tune, but don't know where to start? Execution plans can be a great starting point for understanding what your query is doing under the hood. This course covers the bare bones basics: what an execution plan is, how to run them, how to read them, 5 common troublemakers, and where to learn more. If an execution plan looks like hieroglyphics, this course is for you!
