## Title: Merging Excel files from SharePoint for Analysis in Tableau with the BI Stack
## Abstract:
### Leveraging the Microsoft BI stack to grab multiple Excel files from SharePoint folders, merge them together, and ultimately bring them into Tableau Desktop for additional analysis.  The solution will help with the common problem when different regions of a company are submitting different versions of the same Excel document/report which need to be combined and analyzed as a whole.  Rather than downloading and manually merging dozens of documents, this solution will detail the automated process for making this happen.
