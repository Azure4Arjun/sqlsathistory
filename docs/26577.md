## Title: Amazon RDS and SQL Azure - DB in the cloud
## Abstract:
### Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure both offer SQL Server instances as services (not necessarily as servers).  What do they offer, why would one use them, how do they differ, what special considerations are there?  What exactly does “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) mean with SQL?
