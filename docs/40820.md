## Title: Don't get your three-tiered environments in a twist!
## Abstract:
### How to keep the database parts of three tier server environments (Development, Staging [QA], Production) in alignment so you can minimize risk to your production release process.  I'll show you how we have been able to keep application database releases from spiraling out of control and give us the ability to rollback and respond to rapidly changing environments and how to release what was truly testing in the staging tier. Rapid development requires rapid changes to the database schema and with the change of database schema come some difficulties that can be managed to reduce downtime and scale-ability.
