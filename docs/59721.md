## Title: The RDBMS is Dead, Long Live the RDBMS!
## Abstract:
### In the last 40 years, the “death” of the Relational Database Management System has been predicted over and over – and yet the platform survives. It has adapted, grown, improved and thrived. As a data professional, how does your career change as the platform changes? Which buzzwords are “real” – what do you need to learn, and what skills do you need to pursue? Come join Buck Woody, Microsoft’s “Real world DBA” and explore the history - and future - of the RDBMS.
