## Title: Control PHI and Sensitive Data Risk for Self-Service BI using Power BI DataFlows and Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Protected Health Information (PHI) and other forms of sensitive data are an area of concern in all industries. Highly regulated industries such as Healthcare and Financial Services have a great deal of person-specific information in their systems, and often restrict the use of self-service Business Intelligence (BI) to prevent the wrong people from seeing the wrong data. This presentation will review new ways to safely enable self-service BI for an enterprise without introducing additional risk of PHI or sensitive data violations. I'll review strategies and architectures that include Power BI DataFlows with Azure Data Lake to eliminate sensitive data from a self-service BI environment. An infrastructure leveraging these tools can still have highly controlled and governed enterprise Power BI reports that carefully distribute PHI and sensitive data to targeted users, while also enabling self-service BI without an increased risk of sensitive data violations.
