## Speaker: James Livingston
## Title: Pester your SQL Servers!
## Abstract:
### As DBAs blur the lines between automation and software engineering, they must also employ sound software engineering principals.  One of these key principals is testing.  And just as you can automate DBA tasks, the same automation can be extended to unit testing.

This session will explore the PowerShell unit testing module Pester and how it can be applied to the automation code that a DBA creates.  We'll cover the basics of Pester and how it can be employed by DBAs.

This session will work through some light demos.  Familiarity with SQL Server database administration and PowerShell is helpful but not required.
