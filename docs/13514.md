## Title: A Deep Dive in SQL Server 2012 Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 brings strong support for data warehousing (DW). However, even in the previous versions there has been a lot of effort put in DW enhancements: star join optimization through bitmap filters, known from SQL Server 2008, table partitioning and basic window functions known from SQL Server 2005, indexed views, known from SQL Server 2000, and more. In SQL Server 2012, the Transact-SQL language is enhanced with advanced window functions. Columnstore indexes are a new way of storing data for efficient DW queries. This session explains the theoretical background for the enhancements and how they can be useful in a data warehousing scenario.
