## Speaker: Denis Reznik
## Title: SQL vs. NoSQL. It's always a hard choice.
## Abstract:
### This will be an interesting and sometimes fun session with a small demo. This session will answer some of your questions and force you to think about new questions. It will not be very technical, so it's ok for choose another more technical session from the schedule :) But if will decide to come, I can assure you, that you will not be disspointed.
