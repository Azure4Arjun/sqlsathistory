## Title: SSRS 101 – Creating Reports For Diagnostic Data
## Abstract:
### DBAs always have a collection of queries that they need to run periodically to find out information on the databases they manage. Sometimes this information is requested by management or other IT colleagues. In this session, I’ll show you how to create your first report. We’ll talk about data sources, parameters and internal functions. We’ll add data to tables, commonly referred to as Tablixes and group the data by column fields. We’ll also talk about how to leverage templates so that you can kick-start your report creation. Finally, we’ll see how to quickly publish reports to a SSRS Report Manager.
