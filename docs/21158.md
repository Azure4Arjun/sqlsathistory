## Title: Develop your data Standards with SQL Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### Managing information in an enterprise typically involves integrating data from across the enterprise and beyond, cleansing the data, matching the data to remove any duplicates, standardizing the data, enriching the data, making the data conform to legal and compliance requirements, and then storing the data in a centralized location with all the necessary security settings. You will learn how to use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and Data Quality Services (DQS) together.
