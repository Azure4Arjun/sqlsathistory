## Title: Performance Tuning Azure SQL Databases
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning is a critical skill for both DBAs and Developers, and it becomes even more critical when there’s a monthly cost attached to the performance of the database. How do you get the best out of that database when both the hardware and operating system are in someone else’s hands? Fortunately, Azure SQL Database provides several features that can be leveraged for quick and easy performance gains. 

In this session, we’ll cover three key performance tuning features; Automatic Tuning, Intelligent Insights, and Extended Events. Each of these will be reviewed specifically with a focus on how it applies to Azure SQL Databases. Attendees will learn how to take advantage of each of these features, allowing them to save both time and money, and ensuring that their Azure SQL Databases are performing at their best.
