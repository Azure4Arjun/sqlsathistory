# SQLSaturday #97 - Austin 2011
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Erin Welker
## Title: Zero to cube in 1 hour
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll walk through the steps for creating a multidimensional schema (star schema) for a subject area we're all familiar with, load the tables we create via SSIS, and build an SSAS cube to facilitate analytical analysis. The session is almost completely demo-driven, and will hopefully inspire you to go home and build your first BI solution to facilitate your own analysis.
