## Title: ETL Frameworks using SSIS Programming with .NET
## Abstract:
### Every organization has to deal with the constant loading of text,csv,excel,pipe, fixed width, and ragged right files in this session we are going to build a metadata driving ETL framework that will dynamically create an standard SSIS template that will encompass the file format, enforce standards, and keep track of data lineage across an organization.
