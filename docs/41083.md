## Title: SSIS 2012/2014:  The Quiet Revolution
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server 2012 release of SSIS was a complete game changer.  Using sample packages, we'll show you how to deploy projects to the new SSIS catalog.  You will see how project level parameters and connection managers can make your life easier. You will learn how to configure packages using the new configuration editor in SSMS. We'll show you how to define a collection of configuration settings called an Environment which can automatically configure packages deployed to a server.  Find out why SQL Agent no longer captures SSIS errors in the log and how you can get information about failed packages.  Get up to speed on using the latest features of SSIS to make you job easier.
