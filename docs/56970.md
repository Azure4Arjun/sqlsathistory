## Title: Beyond the Basics of Multidimensional vs Tabular in SQL 2016
## Abstract:
### This session is all about hands-on experience and information sharing of SQL 2016 MultiD vs Tabular differences that are not articulated in common Internet blogs and MSDN comparison charts.  You will be seeing  VS examples of many-to-many, date calculation strategies, role playing dimensions, hierarchies and we'll be talking a lot about available properties.  We'll be covering storage and query engines, performance tuning and extended events.  If you are evaluating either of these SSAS tools for your BI project, come spend an hour digging into the detail which will help you make a more informed project decision.
