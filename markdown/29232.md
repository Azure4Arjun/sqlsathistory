## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: How to Defuse Problems Like a Consultant
## Abstract:
### Consultants work with technology, but they also deal with a lot of politics. Brent Ozar was a production DBA for years and sat through thousands of meetings. Now that he’s a consultant, he’s figured out how consultants handle political bombs during meetings, and he wants to share his favorite consulting lines with you. You’ll learn how to deal with dangerous developers, miserable managers, and cussing customers using simple lines that won’t blow up in your face.
