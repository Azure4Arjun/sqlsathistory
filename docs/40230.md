## Title: SQL Server 2016 Query Store
## Abstract:
### Have you ever experienced to have your system slowed down or completely down? What happens? Have you ever upgraded an application to the latest version of SQL Server and facing an issue with plan change that slows your application down? Query Plan choice change can cause these issues. SQL Server 2016, through a new feature called Query Store, let's make these problems easier to fix. Query Store retains all the execution plans used for each query; it captures the performance metrics for each plan over the time and allows you to force an execution plan easily. In this session, you will learn how the Query Store works and how it can help you to fix performance problems.
