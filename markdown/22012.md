## Speaker: Peter Myers
## Title: An Introduction to Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### "A Festivus for the rest of us!". That was how Seinfeld character Frank Costanza described his alternative to the Christmas tradition. In this session, I'll describe an alternative to the traditional approach to Data Science. Armed with nothing but a browser and an internet connection, I'll show you how easy it is to use Azure Machine Learning to build cloud-powered predictive models and deploy them as web services for application integration.  After setting the context of where predictive modelling fits in the overall analytics spectrum, we'll dive into the Azure offering, before building and deploying a machine learning model from scratch using Azure Machine Learning Studio.
