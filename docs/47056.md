## Title: Always-On Availability Groups: Replicas, Listeners  Quorums, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Would you like to leverage the advantages of an Availability Group within your Enterprise environment to provide high availability and disaster recovery?  This discussion will cover different scenarios where an Availability Group could (and should) be implemented, along with a full demonstration of the setup of an Availability Group.  We will explore the concepts that are critical to a successful AG deployment and look at the evolution of Availability Groups from SQL 2012 through 2016.
