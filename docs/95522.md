## Title: Introduction To SQL Server In Containers
## Abstract:
### Finally, it's become easy for SQL Server developers and DBAs to use containers to speed up software development and testing. Containers have been around for more than 30 years, and at last they have become a great tool for Microsoft data professionals. Join Grant Fritchey to learn how containers differ from virtual machines, and why containers make it incredibly fast to deploy new instances of SQL Server. Grant will use Docker containers to demo the process of spinning up a new SQL Server using the very latest version of the product -- without actually installing SQL Server! Finally, you'll learn how containers can be used in the software development lifecycle to speed up the process of developing, testing, and deploying changes.
