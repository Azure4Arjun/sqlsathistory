## Title: SQL Server 2017: Graph Database Inside-Out
## Abstract:
### Relational databases has been around since decades. It uses a highly structured schema to store information in tabular form and are optimized to find answers about the data. One of the challenges where relational databases struggle with is to find answers on data relationships.

Graph databases uses graph theory to store information in a collection of nodes and edges. Graph databases are optimized to find answers about the relationships. With graph data processing available in SQL Server 2017 we will get the best of both relational and graph databases in a single product.

In this session the audience will learn about what is graph databases, why graph databases, and how to use the new graph data processing extension of SQL Server 2017.
