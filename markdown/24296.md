## Title: Leveraging PowerShell for SharePoint Database Operations
## Abstract:
### PowerShell has become the lifeblood of SharePoint Administrators and it's simplicity, elegance and intuitive nature makes our lives easier, or does it?

Many SharePoint admins suffer from "decisions made by SharePoint" when using both the UI and PowerShell to configure and manage their farms, database operations in particular are often clunky and inefficient due to how SharePoint uses its own stored procedures to manage its databases.

In this session we will look at how SharePoint admins can unleash their DBA-fu via PowerShell to help their SharePoint farm databases run efficiently, optimally and (the big one) FASTER.

If you want to understand how you can utilise PowerShell in SharePoint database scenarios, this session is for you.
