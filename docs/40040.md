## Title: Exploring Optimistic Concurrency
## Abstract:
### The topic of SQL Server concurrency is for sure one of the most complex ones in the field. Locking, blocking, timeouts and performance issues are just some of the consequences of not choosing the proper isolation level for our applications. In this demo-intensive session we will not only talk, but actually go deep into optimistic concurrency and the two isolation levels it offers to us - Read Committed Snapshot and Snapshot isolation level. We will see how they work, how much they can help for the performance and scalability of our applications and what are the little gotchas we need to be aware of.
