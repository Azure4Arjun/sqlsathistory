## Title: DataZen and MS SQL 2016 Mobile BI now
## Abstract:
### Microsoft purchased DataZen last year. With the upcoming release of MS SQL 2016 the DataZen Business Intelligence dashboards are integrating into SSRS. The SSRS 2016 web portal has some significant changes. This session will cover the how DataZen enterprise has changed from a standalone web service to part of SSRS. I'll also do a walkthrough of migrating existing DataZen dashboards to a SSRS 2016 instance.
