## Title: Modern T-SQL for Better Performance
## Abstract:
### Once you learn how to write queries, it’s easy to fall back on the same old patterns. You need to get the job done, and using old techniques is often quicker than learning something new. Over the past decade, Microsoft has released several versions of SQL Server with T-SQL enhancements, and many of these enhancements not only let you write queries easier, the queries also run faster. 

Join this session to learn how this “new” T-SQL functionality can save you time when writing queries that also perform great.
