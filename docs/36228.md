## Title: Hadoop and SQL Together: Modern Data Warehouse Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### No question about it, Hadoop is here and enterprises large and small are starting to embrace it. The adoption rate of Hadoop is making some EDW professionals anxious about this technology replacing their tried and true relational data warehouse.  This is a worry that need not be had.

In this session, we'll go through several design patterns that show how Hadoop can augment an existing relational data warehoue, and show WHY we need both technologies to cover the broad spectrum of reporting an analytics.

This session is largely conceptual, although we will cover a few code examples to show how some of the Hadoop technologies work in conjunction with SQL Server as a data warehousing platform.
