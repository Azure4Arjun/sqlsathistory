## Speaker: Sandra Peele
## Title: Working with Multiple DBMS Platforms: You're Not in Kansas Anymore
## Abstract:
### Imagine you have a new employee with valuable SQL experience, but from a different DBMS platform.  Or imagine you’ve been assigned to a project that involves a DBMS other than SQL Server.  What do you need to know?  In this high-level presentation, Sandra will highlight differences between default Windows installations of Oracle, Postgres, DB2, SQLite, MySQL, and SQL Server.  She’ll share her experience moving from one platform to another and what she has found to be the most important thing to keep in mind when working with a new DBMS or working with a new employee who comes from another DBMS environment.

This presentation is for anyone with a basic knowledge of SQL.  It was co-produced with Stéphane Faroult, author of The Art of SQL, SQL Success and other technical books.  The presentation uses techniques found in his latest book, Getting the Message Across: Using Slideware Effectively for Technical Presentations.
