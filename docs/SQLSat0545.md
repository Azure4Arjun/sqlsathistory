Event Date: 01-10-2016 - Session time: 08:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: The Secret to High Performance Code...The Devil’s in the Data
## Abstract:
### You found code you need in a “Holy Grail” article complete with test data and tests across several methods “clearly” identifying the best one to use.  Excited at your good fortune, you quickly download the code, rerun the tests on your Dev box . It “passes” with flying colors.  You promote the code to production and go home on time for a change.
The next day, your boss and the DBA are waiting for you in your cube and, look, the DBA has a bat with your name on it because your code brought the server to its knees and the code failed.
How is that possible?  The answer is, “The Devil’s in the Data”.
Whether you’re an SQL “Newbie” or seasoned veteran, this “Black Arts” session will teach you most of what you need to know to build large quantities of just about any test data you might imagine and more quickly than you ever dreamed.  It’ll also show you how to avoid the pitfalls that lead to the DBA with the bat. ;

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Statistics  Cardinality – How they work to find data efficiently
## Abstract:
### Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

## Title: A Discussion on the Azure SQL Database Security for the Cloud Objectionist
## Abstract:
### This session is for the those who have security objections related to moving to the cloud or are interested in the security features of the of the Azure SQL Database, a relational database Platform as a Service offering in Microsoft Azure.  There certainly are Azure SQL Database features which have parity with SQL Server engine features (Always Encrypted, TDE, RLS, etc.).  But this session will take a look at security features focused on the Azure SQL Database; server firewall settings, Auditing  Threat detection,  Alert Rules, Role-based Access Control and configuring Azure AD Authentication.  If time permits, we will step through Dynamic Data Making via the Azure portal.  Hopefully the main take away will be a warm and fuzzy (and more secure) feeling about planning for cloud workloads.

## Abstract:
### If you’ve been a SQL Server DBA or Dev for any length of time, you’ve probably heard of various options that you can set at the instance- or database-level that can impact performance.  Do you know what they are, when to use them, or what they do?  And what about all of those trace flags?  There are so many of them and many are undocumented.  What gives?  In this session, you’ll learn about a variety of ways to speed up IO, adjust memory, change plan and buffer cache behavior, debug the SQL query optimizer, and how to punch SQL Server in the face!

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: #16 | Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline w/PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

## Speaker: Ben Galluzzo
## Title: Working with SSRS Data-Driven Subscriptions 
## Abstract:
### SSRS Subscriptions are one of the great things within SSRS to automate delivery of reports.  However, one of the more powerful methods of further enhancing this automation is by use of data-driven subscriptions.  Data-driven subscriptions allow us to determine at run time what subscribers and other parameters can be used for automating the generation of these reports.

We#39;ll begin with a quick overview of what the more familiar subscription functionality is and then quickly jump into what data-driven subscriptions provide for us.  We#39;ll then demonstrate from beginning to end how to implement data-driven-subscriptions.  Lastly, we#39;ll wrap up with any tips and tricks to enhance our process.
