## Title: A travelers' guide to Vertica
## Abstract:
### In which I share my experience using the Community Vertica Analytics database. I'll explore the following questions as my experience and research has informed me:  • Overview of the Vertica DB analytical system, and some reasons to consider it (columnar, compression, rich SQL, R integration, distributed DBs, community version free up to 1TB). • Strengths of Vertica, weaknesses. • What are Vertica projections? My success and lack of success using them to make queries run more efficiently. • R integration overview: how to use R in Vertica SQL queries.
