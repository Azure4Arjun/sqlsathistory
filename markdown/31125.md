## Title: Holy Crap! Someone Put the Database in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### The world of databases is constantly changing.  It used to be that we kept all of our servers and data locked up in big, expensive server rooms in the back of the building.  Now days, you hear about data existing in this cloud-thing.  So what happens when you come in on Monday morning and the latest database was deployed in the cloud.  In this session, weâ€™ll look at what it means to be a DBA with SQL Azure and how the more things change the more they stay the same.
