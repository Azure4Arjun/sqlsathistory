## Title: Flash Storage Drill Down: Know Your Storage Infrastructure
## Abstract:
### Flash Storage (Solid State Disks) have been proclaimed to be a DBA's best friend. But not all flash storage is the same. In this talk, we will drill down a bit into the technology, and talk about the issues that can degrade your application's performance.  This talk examines those issues in detail, looking at how they specifically affect databases and the structured applications that depend on those databases.  And just like the free version of Pandora Radio, there will only be one slide that is commercial in nature.
