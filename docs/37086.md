## Title: Beauty and the Bits:  Why both Left and Right Brain MUST be Engaged
## Abstract:
### Whether you plan to run your own consulting business, be a freelancer, or be a healthy part of a software or design team you will need to understand the importance of engaging both your left- and right-brain in the future. Sure, you are smart and you have a good left-brain, but raw processing power, reasoning, and logic are not enough to compete, provide, or even survive in the coming "Conceptual Age." Just as manufacturing automation put much of the "human back" out of business in the Industrial Age, certain forces threaten to put the "human brain" out of business in the age to come. This talk will prepare you for its arrival and insulate you for its duration. Learn how to recognize and utilize the value of well-rounded thinking as you progress throughout your career.
