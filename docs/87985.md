## Title: Get started with Power BI Dataflows
## Abstract:
### Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of any analytics project yet getting this right is vital if outcomes are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI empowers users to explore their data, the task of collecting and cleansing this data often requires more experienced hands. 

Dataflows are an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can quickly be consumed by business analysts, improving the speed at which business value is delivered. Dataflows can also be used to provide the single version of the truth that has traditionally been provided by data warehouses. 

During this talk, we will demonstrate the creation of a dataflow using multiple data sources and also have a look at how you can get started for free using your Power BI Pro subscription.
