## Title: How do I create an automated ETL test suite ??
## Abstract:
### There are many automated test frameworks available for different types of applications, but Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data movement applications seem to lack an efficient and easy to use automated test suite. 

We will review how the automated test suite is a data driven approach by showing how the tests self-generate based upon the data in the Information-Model schema in SQL Server and 4 slender custom tables that define the field data mapping between the source and target.

The last half of the session will be a demonstration of the tests to illustrate how they execute. To do this we will quickly review the stored procedure code that generates the tests.
