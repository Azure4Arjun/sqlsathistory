## Title: Azure Cognitive Services using containers
## Abstract:
### Azure Cognitive Services are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications. The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a non-cloud AI solution (because of limited Internet access or data compliance).Container support in Azure Cognitive Services allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, and enables flexibility in where to deploy and host the services that come with Docker containers. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, weâ€™ll explore what it takes to configure and use containers support in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be
