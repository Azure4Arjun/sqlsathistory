## Speaker: Dave Tigges
## Title: That's Not in My Job Description: The Accidental Developer
## Abstract:
### By now most everyone is familiar with the term "Accidental DBA".  They are the people who for one reason or another, and usually by no choice of their own, wind up being their company's DBA by default.  But what about the reverse of that situation? You could be happily installing, configuring and maintaining SQL Server, taking care of backups, restorations, setting up HA and DR and then all of a sudden your boss asks you to write some code.  It could be a complex report using SSRS, it could be an SSIS package, a small data entry intranet web app or a dashboard. DON'T PANIC.  In this session we will show you how use the skills that you have developed as a SQL Server DBA, along with other free tools that are available to you, and show you how to make coding easier than you thought!
