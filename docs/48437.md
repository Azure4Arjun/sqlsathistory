## Abstract:
### The second part of the combo will go deep dive into the new language U-SQL. Oliver, Sascha and Tillmann will explain the concepts of the new language as a mix of SQL and C#. They will take Visual Studio and show the power of the new analytical language by creating complex queries, building functionality in C#, creating extractors, using federation to combine different data streams and tools like Azure Data Factory or SSIS to integrate into your landscapes. The combo session will close by explaining how to debug and monitor your U-SQL scripts on the Azure Data Lake Services and what you need to know controlling the service from a cost perspective.
