## Title: Why I Won't Be Hiring You
## Abstract:
### You're a DBA or SQL Developer and you are looking for a new gig. You've trawled the job sites, found a position I am hiring for, and decided that it is the job for you. You spruce up your resume and send it in, hoping for the best.

In this session I will go over some critical mistakes that will prevent you from getting a job, such as:
 - Why your resume is an instant turn-off
 - That thing you said on the phone screen that was flat out wrong
 - Why the in-person interviewer took an immediate dislike to you
