## Abstract:
### Get a Lever and Pick Any Turtle: Lifting with Metadata

Ever wondered how to do operations on a list of tables?  Get a list of all the columns over a certain length?  Automate tedious writing of repetitive code if only there was a way to tell the query to just do this for all VARCHAR columns?

Integrated metadata is a required element of all RDBMSs. In addition to ANSI INFORMATION_SCHEMA and metadata on implementation-specific features like indexes, SQL Server also offers a very powerful extended properties feature. In this talk, I cover using the basic metadata combined with extended properties and demonstrate some practical usages to organize and document a system's design and monitor the health of a system's compliance with design rules, but there are many uses of the system metadata for code generation and automating maintenance.

Basic knowledge of T-SQL and relational database principles is assumed.
