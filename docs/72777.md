## Title: Choosing Sides in the ETL vs ELT Debate
## Abstract:
### The debate regarding the relative merits of extract transform load (ETL) and extract load transform (ELT) data migration strategies isn’t new, but it remains relevant. Making the right choice is critical, because the wrong solution will slow development cycles and execution times, and increase the cost and complexity of code maintenance.  In this presentation, I’ll cover some best practices for implementing an ELT solution for a variety of data migration scenarios.  Data enthusiasts of any level will benefit from a detailed discussion of methodologies, strategic benefits, and code examples.  The discussion will focus on the SQL Server stack including Azure and code examples will use T-SQL and SSIS.
