## Title: Say Anything: Using knowledge base, NLP and AI to enable customer
## Abstract:
### Today companies have an abundance of unstructured data. It exists in emails, text files and documents. It is not easily searchable and usable without a lot of prep work. But this data contains valuable information! 
Companies can use this new information in many different ways, for example to enable customers for a self-service support. Customers might be looking for the same answer, but they will likely ask their questions in different ways. Customers really want to be able to ... say anything.
Come and learn how to use Azure technologies to build a Chat Bot to answer questions based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or product manuals.
