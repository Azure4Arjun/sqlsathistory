# SQL Internal Storage – P1 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Bruno Basto
## Title: SQL Internal Storage – P1 
## Abstract:
### This session describes how SQL Server internally stores table data. Although you can use SQL without understanding the internals of data storage, a deep knowledge of how data is stored will improve the development of efficient applications. This session explores the basic of metadata that keeps track of data and index storage information.

# StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Constantin Klein
## Title: StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
## Abstract:
### The number of sensors is growing and growing and brings us closer to the "Internet of things". Applications, that have to process a big amount of data from event streams are a logical consequence. Some developers might have heard from Reactive Extensions (Rx) already, but Microsoft offers with StreamInsight (SI) another comprehensive platform for these scenarios.

In this session you will learn what a great addition for your toolbox StreamInsight is, if you have to develop applications, that have to handle complex events (CEP- Complex Event Processing). See how you can start with this technologie and how easy it is to jump in for .NET developers.

# CAST([Transaction Log] as T.SQL) 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Pedro Correia
## Title: CAST([Transaction Log] as T.SQL) 
## Abstract:
### The aim of this session is to take the audience in a quest for the original (or equivalent) T-SQL, that was in the origin of the different transactions recorded, by inspecting the transaction log records and dissecting its data. In a session that tackles several internals storage issues, needed to fulfill its objective, we will go in a travel that starts by the end of the log and will, hopefully, only end at the birth of the database.

# Scale-out scenarios with Transactional Replication
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Eladio Rincon
## Title: Scale-out scenarios with Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### Transactional Replication exists in SQL Server since 1995; It's an stable solution, reliable and scalable 
if it's used properly. Obviously is not a solution for everything so you will have to decide wether this technology
fits for your needs or not. In this session we will introduce the main concepts about transactional replication and two real cases to show the scale-out benefits
of this technology. At the end we will talk about common best practices for transactional replication.

# Optimizing implementation techniques
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Etienne Lopes
## Title: Optimizing implementation techniques
## Abstract:
### This session describes some performance boosters as well as performance killers and some techniques that can lead T-SQL queries, functions and stored procedures to take a few seconds instead of lots of minutes to execute.

For instance: 
- What is best, CTE’s or Temporary Tables? When?
- When joining more than two tables (or intermediate result sets), should we still care about the join order?
- Did you ever expect to see an Index Seek in your execution plan but what you find is an Index Scan, although you took care of parameter sniffing and your statistics are updated?
- Do you care about what isolation level you use?

Using real life based demonstrations, this session will provide answers to these and other questions.

# Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
## Abstract:
### The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

# Dr. DMV: How to Use Dynamic Management Views
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Glenn Berry
## Title: Dr. DMV: How to Use Dynamic Management Views
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2008 R2 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL Server 2005 through 2012), presents and explains over fifty DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment.

# UDFs, or: How to kill performance in one easy step
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#188---Portugal-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: UDFs, or: How to kill performance in one easy step
## Abstract:
### User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of SQL Server and still get good performance.
