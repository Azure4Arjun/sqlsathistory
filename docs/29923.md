## Title: Revive the code: refactoring for performance
## Abstract:
### Stored procedures are slow? SQL Server is overloaded? Maybe it's time to upgrade the server. But maybe all you need to do is the code refactoring. 

This session shows how to replace several common procedural style patterns in T-SQL code with set-based approaches. It demonstrates how to gain huge performance improvements using CTE, table-valued functions, TVP, MERGE operator, OUTPUT clause and other modern T-SQL constructs. No PowerPoint slides. Presentation is based on the real examples and real code.
