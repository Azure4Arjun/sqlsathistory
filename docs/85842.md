## Speaker: Luis Beltran
## Title: SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Python and R
## Abstract:
### Machine learning isn't just a buzzword anymore. It's everywhere! Text-sentiment analysis, face recognition in images/videos, real-time text/voice translation... you name it! Tons of applications use powerful Artificial Intelligence algorithms which analyze and process millions of data in order to provide a suitable, reliable experience.

But... did you know that you can use SQL Server to create powerful machine learning models with Python code and deploy them to your SQL instance? What about building predictive models in R using a SQL Server datasource so you can foresee the future? Well, with SQL Server Machine Learning Services this is possible (and more, much more!).

In this session, I will show you how to prepare your environment to do ML in SQL Server, as well as some cool demos.
