## Title: SQL anti patterns
## Abstract:
### You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.
