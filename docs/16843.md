## Title: Flash  SQL Serverâ€” Re-Thinking Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used. Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head. Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash. Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability. Learn how flash flips the /faster bit  the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices,  the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash.
