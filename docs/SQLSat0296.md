# T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-296)
Event Date: 05-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Shehab El-Najjar
## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers
## Abstract:
### To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users or adequate volume of data  is exists there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live and they become performing badly ending up with standstill cases sometimes , this is due to lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs so I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be analyzed within this session)

## Speaker: Konstantin Khomyakov
## Title: Data Quality Services (Deep dive)
## Abstract:
### Data Quality Services (DQS) is one of the main mechanisms for data normalization, removing duplicate content and filling knowledge base. It allows you to perform various operations to obtain quality data. The main feature is the creation of the knowledge base, in which there are basic configuration, data manipulation rules. DQS Cleansing is the standard SSIS control, which is used for normalization (cleansing) data.

In this session two new controls will be introduced: DQS Domain Value Import and DQS Matching Transformation. During the session SSIS package will be created. This package will automate the process of importing domain entities, including synonyms, to the existing knowledge base. Also mechanism for removing duplicates will be applied, relying on returned weights coefficients compared between each set of records.

# Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-296)
Event Date: 05-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Paul te Braak
## Title: Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
## Abstract:
### Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.
