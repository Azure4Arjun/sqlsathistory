## Title: SQL Server 2016 -  Real Time Operational Analytics - "Real" Game changer
## Abstract:
### Performing analytics on operational data has all along being a huge challenge for applications, due to its impact on
regular operations and day to day transactions. SQL Server 2016 has extended its analytic capablities by its
enahancements on "In memory tables" and Columnstore indexes."In memory tables" combined with columnstore indexes
is a boon for performing analytics on operational data with no impact to regular workload, with no delayed data,
no complex ETL tasks and without a need to maintain seperate data warehouse. 

The presentation would cover how "In Memory" Columnstore indexes help to perform real time operational analytics 
and would involve interesting demos show casing the gains using SQL Server 2016 "In Memory" and Column Store Index enhancements. Presentation would also demonstrate and compare the performances of "In Memory" columnstore indexes and disk based columnstore indexes.
