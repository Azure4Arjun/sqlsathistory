## Title:  Data Modeling for Large Scale Cube systems 
## Abstract:
### Implimenting agility and leveraging tool to deliver cubes faster is the next generation for Data Warehousing initiatives.    I'll show you how to generate C# applications for SSIS And Cubes, impliment a tool for generating the SSIS, Dimensional structures, and building the cubes.  

This is just the start because I'll be interjecting how to Model Data Warehouses for major companies and how your company needs to do it.  You don't get hired for knowing Kimball and Inmon anymore.
