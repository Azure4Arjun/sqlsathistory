## Title: High Performance and Highly Available SANLess Clustering for MS SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Join SIOS to learn how to eliminate the IO bottlenecks, costs and failure points with traditional SAN-based clustering.   By leveraging the performance of high-speed storage such as that offered by Fusion- io, and by adopting a SANless architecture to achieve higher levels of availability with SIOS – this ‘blueprint’ gives you the best of both worlds – cost effective performance and protection.
