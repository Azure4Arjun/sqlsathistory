## Title: From Impaired To Insightful Geospatial Reporting
## Abstract:
### It is expected that business reports be insightful and engaging. Region based reporting can be transformed from boring grids to visually interactive maps. This session will describe how to embark upon self-service and mobile BI solutions that are available within the Microsoft BI stack for analytical geospatial reporting. You will learn the basics of geographical data, including GIS, Longitude-Latitude coordinates and free form text. Using these different data types, we will discuss SSRS 2012, Power View and Excel 2013 tools that can leverage insightful analysis. Finally and most importantly, attending this talk will get you started in learning the essential techniques to deliver geospatial reports that tell meaningful stories for users.
