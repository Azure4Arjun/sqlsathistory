## Title: Enterprise Information Management with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Companies want to gather information from the data; therefore, they start BI projects. They design a data warehouse and then start developing extract – transform – load (ETL) applications. However, most of BI projects have to deal with problems with data quality (DQ). Data quality can be a huge obstacle for a successful BI project. Of course, line of business applications suffer from poor data quality as well.
Every company has part of the data which is used everywhere, in every transaction, like customers data, products data and similar. Such data is called master data. People who manage master data are often called data stewards. Processes and activities for maintaining master data are known as master data management (MDM). In this presentation, we are going to discuss ETL, DQ and MDM problems and introduce how Microsoft SQL Server 2016 tools can help you with solutions.
