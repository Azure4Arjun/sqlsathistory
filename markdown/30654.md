## Title: Heterogeneous Data Integration with SSIS  CDC
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on Microsoft and partner technologies that enable high performance, efficient and real-time data integration using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and that work with data from Oracle, Teradata, and other heterogeneous sources. You will learn how Microsoft high-speed Connectors by Attunity can be leveraged with change-data-capture (CDC) technologies integrated with SSIS to enable data replication. Use cases highlighting real-time data warehousing and operational reporting, as well as maintenance of data consistency between operational databases and applications will also be outlined.
