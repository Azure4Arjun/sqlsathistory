## Title: Instant SQL Sandbox Using Docker
## Abstract:
### SQL Server running on Linux was unthinkable ten years ago. Now it is not only possible to run SQL Server on Linux, but also Windows 10 as the sandbox and development machines that can host SQL Server on Linux. It is possible because of a Container technology. Using Azure Data Studio's notebook as the runbook, we will show step by step to deploy SQL Server on Docker in Windows 10 desktop . The demo will also show the experimental feature of  LCOW (Linux Container on Windows).
