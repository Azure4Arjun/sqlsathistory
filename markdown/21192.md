## Title: In-Memory OLTP: Three key points to monitor.
## Abstract:
### We hear a lot about in-memory OLTP and its benefits, how to migrate and reach out the best performance. Now it's time to keep it up and running! As other components on SQL Server, the in-memory OLTP also needs a proper monitoring. We have a range of options to detect possible problems on both memory and disk level. This session will explore few possible scenarios that we need to look into, as well as how to perform the monitoring in the best way.
