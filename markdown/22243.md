## Title: Surviving a Technical SQL Interview
## Abstract:
### At some point every SQL interview is going to get technical.  This session will go through my favorite questions as an interviewer and talk about their overall relevance and answers.  We'll talk about how to handle the situations where you aren't sure of the answer - or when you know that you don't know the answer  The questions will cover database design, DBA, SSIS and SSRS aspects of SQL server. Pointers to resources will also be given.
