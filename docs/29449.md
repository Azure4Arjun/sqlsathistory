## Title: Writing faster queries
## Abstract:
### Poor database performance is Achilles' heel of any system.  Better and faster hardware can improve systems to a certain point.  However, for truly great performing systems, there is no substitute for properly written queries and designed indexes.  In this session we'll take a look at some common query performance killers, along with some no so obvious things that we can do to our queries to make them as fast as possible.
