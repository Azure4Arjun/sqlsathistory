## Title: Implementing a new database platform for your modern data warehouse – Snowflake on Azure
## Abstract:
### The “new database on the block” Snowflake, the data warehouse built for the cloud is now available on Azure with a strategic alliance with Microsoft. What makes the new platform worth over 4B and having the status of the fastest-growing SaaS solution in the analytics market? In the presentation, we will build a sample data warehouse, ingest the data using Azure Data Factory and look at the unique capabilities of the database comparing to the cloud alternatives (Azure SQL Datawarehouse, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift). The presentation will be based on the practical examples of use cases in the region and what I have learned regarding the new platform in the last 2 years. Lots of hands-on examples and integrations with Azure stack like Data Factory, Power BI and Azure Databricks.
