## Speaker: Andy Wickman
## Title: Simple DR Setup
## Abstract:
### Setting up a DR plan can be tedious.  Luckily there is a WIZARD for most of it.  However, when databases get larger, the wizards don't work as well.  Lucky for us, we have POWERSHELL!!  This presentation will show you a simple way to set up your DR plan, and if you do a lot of log shipping, say goodbye to having to manage 5 separate SQL Jobs to get one database configured.  This presentation includes usage of the community powershell tools project (dbatools.io).
