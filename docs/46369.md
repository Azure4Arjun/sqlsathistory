## Title: Cardinality Estimator - Before 2014 and After
## Abstract:
### Cardinality estimator providing row estimates, plays a pivotal role in obtaining efficient query plans. Cardinality Estimator algorithm which remained unchanged since SQL 7.0, was revamped in SQL Server 2014. The presentation will take a ride through the new cardinality estimator, showcase the need for the significant redesign and demonstrate the new cardinality estimator's efficiency at different scenarios. Presentation will also cover how one can perform regressive testing, checking for any performance degradation on new cardinality estimator and how they can be handled gracefully.
