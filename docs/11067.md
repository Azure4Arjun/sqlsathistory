## Title: Designing a Data Recovery Solution
## Abstract:
### Having scheduled database backups is one thing, but knowing what backup types are needed is a different horse of a different color. Building on the "Backups 101" session, this discussion focuses on why we should build Recovery solutions instead of Backup solutions, and the most important things to remember when designing the solution.
