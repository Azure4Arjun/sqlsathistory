## Title: Building a Modern Data Warehouse and Analytics Solution in Azure
## Abstract:
### For years, data warehouses have required a significant investment in hardware and software. We frequently planned for the three year lifecycle. As virtual machines started to handle the load, we gained additional flexibility. In this session, we will look at the various services in Azure and how they can be leveraged to handle various workloads and capabilities. By blending IaaS, PaaS, and even SaaS in the Microsoft Cloud, we can build highly flexible and scalable solutions to meet our needs large and small. We will look at some designs and their strengths and weaknesses including cost, maintenance, scalability, and elasticity.
