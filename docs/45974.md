## Title: Relational databases vs Non-relational databases
## Abstract:
### There is a lot of confusion about the place and purpose of the many recent non-relational database solutions (“NoSQL databases”) compared to the relational database solutions that have been around for so many years.  In this presentation I will first clarify what exactly these database solutions are, compare them, and discuss the best use cases for each.  I’ll discuss topics involving OLTP, scaling, data warehousing, polyglot persistence, and the CAP theorem.  We will even touch on a new type of database solution called NewSQL.  If you are building a new solution it is important to understand all your options so you take the right path to success.
