## Title: It's TEMPDB Why Should You Care
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right?  It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right?  WRONG.  This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.
