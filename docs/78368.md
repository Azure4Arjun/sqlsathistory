## Title: How to transition from Profiler to Extended Events and why you should consider.
## Abstract:
### Let me ask you, what comes to your mind when you hear / read phrase SQL Server Extended Events? You may be thinking: "What is it, what does it do?", "I don’t have time to learn this", "I already have the tool that does all I need", "It’ll require too much coding", "There is no way Extended Events can do what SQL Profiler does."
Why don’t we take a closer look using straightforward examples in order to figure out what it’s all about, because learning Extended Events is fun and easy.

In this session we will cover the following:
-- How to create an extended event session using an existing trace.
-- How to create XE (Extended Events) in UI (User interface) from the ground up.
-- How to analyze the data.
-- What to watch out for in terms of performance.
