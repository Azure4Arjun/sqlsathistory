## Speaker: Sreeja Pullagura
## Title: SSIS DevOps with Azure Containers
## Abstract:
### Do you want faster turnaround and higher code quality for your SSIS projects, without disturbing your live environment? Join SSIS DevOps Pioneer, Sreeja Pullagura, in a live demo as she shows us how to run SSIS in a Docker container to help meet your dreams of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for SSIS.

First, we’ll see how to modify the existing Microsoft Docker file for SQL Server 2017 to run SSIS. Second, we will explore the new container to see what has been created, including SQL Server 2017, required Security roles and users, and the Integration Services catalogue. Third, we will kick off an SSIS job which moves data between databases on the container. Finally, we’ll exercise our SSIS project with unit tests developed in TSQLT (modified version). At the end of this session, we hope you’ll walk away with the confidence to begin or refine your own DevOps journey.
