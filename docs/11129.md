## Speaker: Julie Smith
## Title: Swimming in the Deep End with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Many developers of all sorts get thrown into the deep end of the ETL pool without water wings with SSIS. While the dataflow and basic connections are easier to grok, the true complexity of SSIS often lies hidden in configurations, expressions, and parent child packages. This session is a primer on these lesser known, but frightfully important elements.
