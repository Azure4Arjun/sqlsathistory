## Title: Who's on First? SQL Server statistics  Dynamic Power BI Visuals!
## Abstract:
### What will happen when a Performance Tuner is analyzing statistics and using Power BI reports based on that analysis?  A dynamic learning experience from a different perspective.
The SQL Server optimizer uses distribution statistics when creating execution plans. Statistics are used to provide the optimizer with estimations for the best way to process the query and hopefully optimize performance.
 
Power BI is a powerful tool that has been released in the last few years that helps you visualize your information to help make informative decisions with rich visualization.
 
In this session, we will show you how SQL Server uses statistics to create the execution plan and Power BI to visualize that statistical distribution; with a TWIST.  Roles will be reversed to show a dynamic and interactive learning experience helping users with two different concepts in one exciting session!
