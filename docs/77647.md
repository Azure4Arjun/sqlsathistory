## Title: Azure Data Warehouse: Why, What and How
## Abstract:
### If your regular SQL Server becomes too slow for running your data warehouse queries, or uploading the new data takes too long, you might benefit from the Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Via its “divide and conquer” approach it provides significant performance improvements, yet most client applications can connect to it as if it is a regular SQL Server.
But to benefit from these performance improvements we need to implement our Azure SQL Data Warehouse in the right way. In this session - through a lot of demos - you will learn how to setup your Azure SQL Data Warehouse, review indexing in the context of the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and see that monitoring is done slightly different from what you’re used to.
