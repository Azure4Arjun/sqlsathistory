## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Introduction to Data Science With Python
## Abstract:
### “Python” and “R” are two well-known data science languages being used today. Both of these languages are part of the open source community and have many free modules available for your use.

Which one of the languages do you choose as an enterprise standard?

My money is on the “Python” language, due to the fact it can be used to solve business problems other than ones related to data science.

Python is a general purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed for readability and easy syntax by using significant whitespace. The main goal was to allow programmers to solve problems using fewer lines of code.

During this pre-conference course, we will be covering the following topics.

Python Programming Basics
Introduction to Data Science with Python

This course is meant for beginners who want to learn Python. At the end of the day, you will have a solid understanding of the language and an introduction to the data science libraries.

# Custom Auditing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Development
## Speaker: Meghana Vasavada
## Title: Custom Auditing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In order to effectively monitor SSIS performance, troubleshoot errors and understand the data linage in the production environment one needs to implement the package logging and Data auditing. SSIS already contains an Audit Transformation Component that captures information about the package metadata and the environment in which the package runs.

However, what if you encountered an error, or a package failure?  Suppose, a Data warehouse developer is performing an ETL to load a Dimension of a Data mart and would like to track the Data being processed. Audit Transformation Component cannot perform the job effectively.

So lets have an insight of how Auditing can be done by designing an SSIS  package that captures the Error information, DML operation on the table (Inserts/Updates/Deletes) along with the package metadata.

We'll create a package with an event handler that loads Data from a Staging to Dimension and creates an Audit table to track information on Data processing.

## Title: Big Data Architectures and The Data Lake
## Abstract:
### With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!

## Speaker: Taiob Ali
## Title: How to Tune your BI DBs in Azure to save $$$
## Abstract:
### The cloud is just using someone else's compute. You still need to care about and optimize for performance.  Just as a dropped call frustrates cellular customers, a BI report with data issues, high latency, connection timeouts will create the same frustration for users.  Do you want to catch the performance issues before your customers?  Do you want to automatically identify database issues and quickly drill down into details? Azure provides built in tools just to do that. 

In this session I will show you 4 of those tools.  You will learn how these tools can provide Performance overview of a database and recommendations that can improve workload performance.  Find top resource consuming queries, deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption and learn when to let Azure  automatically optimize your database. 

At the end of this session you will walk out knowing how to identify and tune Azure SQL database performance  issues with built in tools in Azure Portal.

## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Creating and Using Calendar Tables
## Abstract:
### Creating and Using Calendar Tables

There is a common need in analytics and reporting to aggregate data based on date attributes.  These may include weekdays, holidays, quarters, or specific times of the year.  Crunching these metrics on-the-fly can be slow and inefficient.

Calendar tables allow the complex conversions, definitions, and date-related metadata to be calculated ahead of time and stored in a static, reliable structure.  We can then use this table to avoid the need to perform any date math on the fly.  This not only saves time and computing resources, but also allows more complex analytics to be performed that would otherwise be very challenging.

This session delves into the design, implementation, and use of calendar tables, providing plenty of demos that illustrate their value and just how much fun they are!

## Abstract:
### In almost 28 years of working with Microsoft Dynamics GP customers, the formatting for PL and Balance Sheets has not changed.  Sure, some people look at each month side by side, others compare to budget or previous years, but the format varies very little.  How many people in your organization receive a copy of these statements, but do not know how to read the data?  Can they really obtain useful information that provides sound decisions to make your company more profitable?
The traditional format will always be needed, but for operations perhaps there is a more insightful way to really “see” your data.  Attend this webinar and see Belinda present alternatives to the traditional financial statement using Microsoft Power BI and GP data.
Learning Objectives: 
•	Start the process of new ways to visualize financial data
•	Create a plan that can provide information to your team that will help them make more profitable and timely decisions
•	Provide information that helps your data tel

# Azure Databricks (ADB) and the Traditional DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Administration and Performance
## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: Azure Databricks (ADB) and the Traditional DBA
## Abstract:
### As more data services come online in Microsoft Azure, DBAs are being tasked with bringing these services into their organizations.  Azure Databricks is one such service that has the appeal of combining scalable compute resources with collaborative development and analytic tools in Notebooks and workspaces.  To the traditional DBA, however, many of the concepts and language support may be foreign. What the heck is Scala anyway?  This session is designed to introduce the DBA to the Azure Databricks workspace and show how to easily integrate it with upstream and downstream services like Azure Data Factory, Machine Learning and Power BI.

# Power BI gets 'smarter': infuse more AI and ML into your BI processes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Varsham Papikian
## Title: Power BI gets 'smarter': infuse more AI and ML into your BI processes
## Abstract:
### Power BI gets better every day. In addition to supporting R and Python, it gets more AI/ML features ready to use with very little effort - either right 'out-of-box' or as a result of easy integration with relevant Azure services. And this is just the beginning since Microsoft has recently assigned a dedicated AI team to enhance AI capabilities in Power BI so we should expect much more in coming months.
During the session I will describe the Power BI ecosystem and AI/ML in general. Then we will discuss existing and new 'out-of-box' AI features which are easy to use. I hope it will help you to master 'smarter' approaches and help to start exploring and applying predictive analyses to your processes. Stop only asking questions like 'What happened?' - start asking new new type of questions like 'What will happen next?'. Achieve more by using AI-infused features like QA, Insights and Web search by example.

# Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Administration and Performance
## Speaker: Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
## Abstract:
### No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

# Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture/Design
## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
## Abstract:
### Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

# Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Understanding Table Design in BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#813---Boston---BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Deborah Melkin
## Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Understanding Table Design in BI
## Abstract:
### Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.
