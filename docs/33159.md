## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: Data Access Layers: A Cornucopia
## Abstract:
### How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views. More often than not, nearly bringing our systems to their knees. Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course. This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we have managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating data access layers which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS with which to render their data.
