## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: From Big Data to secret sauce: power your organisation with PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Big Data is not so much about storing massive amounts of data in a common database. It is also a force of change for the organisation, and it means that we have to consider the collective capabilities of the platform to serve the business: from data source to secret sauce that will help the business to make data-driven decisions to drive the enterprise forward, using familiar tools such as the new Microsoft Power BI tools
 
In this session, we will look at RHadoop, which is a match made in heaven for data scientists. It is a combination of R, the world's favourite free data analysis tool, and Hadoop. In this session, we will look at an example of using RHadoop to analyse Big Data, from data to result.
 
We will also look at evangelising your secret sauce throughout the business, using Microsoftâ€™s new Power BI tools in Office 365: Power View, Power Map and Power Query. Come and see how to make Big Data accessible, relevant and perhaps even fun!
