## Title: Big Data- Part 1 of 3- Letâ€™s Get Started
## Abstract:
### In this hour I will show you how to set up a Big Data environment, how to load and transform data, and how to access the data using Hadoop and Microsoft utilities. I will leave you with all of the pieces, parts, instructions, and additional experiments to set up your own environment and get some actual stick time. This is part one in a three part series which will take you from setting up your environment to basic analytics to applying analytics to business decision making.
