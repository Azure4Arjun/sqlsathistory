## Title: The Use Cases for In-Memory OLTP
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will do a short introduction to the In-Memory OLTP feature before diving straight into the use cases where the new lockless/latchless concurrency control and native compilation really shines. Demos will cover PAGELATCH contention, use of In-Memory for ETL and In-Memory tables as 'shock absorbers' for high throughput environments. For each case we will do a comparison of "Classic" vrs In-Memory, what gains can the audience expect and what patterns will yield the biggest benefits.
