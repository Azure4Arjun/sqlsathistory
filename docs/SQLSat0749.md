# Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server and Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-749)
Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: PowerBI
## Speaker: Jamey Johnston
## Title: Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server and Power BI
## Abstract:
### The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/2017 and Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS and in Power BI, as well.

This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/2017, Azure SQL Database and Power BI without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations.

Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS.

## Speaker: Daniel Janik
## Title: A DBA's guide to full stack performance troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.

You've got an idea for a new app and it's going to change the world! Right?  It's a brilliant idea  no one has ever thought of it before.   You're working on the GUI for your company's web portal and you know just what information to collect from the user.  Are you sure about that?  Odds are pretty good that the information you're going to collect is a reflection of your life  your experiences.  
Learn how to identify bias when it seeps in, how to code to be inclusive instead of exclusive , and some quick tips  tricks to make sure you're accounting for all the users that will use YOUR application to change the world.  Instead of just the ones that look like you.

# CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-749)
Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from the same flaws.

Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure Cosmos DB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 
In this session, you will learn how to: create a Cosmos DB instance in Azure; work with JSON documents; create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax; create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript; manage security; modify indexes; stream twitter data into a collection; extract data using SSIS C# script tasks into SQL Server; visualize data using PowerBI; and finally compare performance and feature differences between SQL Server 2017 and Azure Cosmos DB when working with JSON data.

## Speaker: Anthony {Tex} Moreign
## Title: The  DATA⋅CLOUD Talk
## Abstract:
### This talk connects the dots between quite some tangents ~ the obvious and the not-so-obvious/forgotten/new-ish aspects of DATA (Big Data, Small Data, Tiny Data, Data Lakes, Data Reservoirs, Micro Data, Macro Data), and CLOUD (Hybrid, Global, Microsoft, Non-Microsoft) available as of this point-in-time (Aug-2018) ~ and some other thoughts. 

AUDIENCE:  Decision makers, decision influencers,  or anyone interested in how DATA tangos with the CLOUD, and the resulting INFORMATION (actionable or otherwise).

PRE-REQUISITES: none

SPEAKER DISCLOSURE:   Tex (20+ year technologist) is with Hybrid Decisions®, a multi-competency Microsoft Gold Partner (consistently since year-1) and OpenSource/Linux (originally C/Unix folks who embraced Microsoft  OpenSource/Linux) … speaking on behalf of HCCUG.org
