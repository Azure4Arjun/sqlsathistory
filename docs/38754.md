## Title: Continuous Integration with SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### After a long maturation process, SQL Server Data Tools is emerging as a huge step forward in database development.  It won't be long before Visual Studio replaces SSMS as the primary IDE for SQL Server developers.  One of the greatest benefits of making the switch is the continuous integration capabilities that are now streamlined by the tool set.  In this session we will discuss how SSDT works, the goal of continuous integration, and how you can put them together to dramatically improve your productivity as a database developer.
