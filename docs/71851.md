## Title: Dynamic SQL: Tables, Pivots, Parameters  More
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a scripting language that helps you design flexibility into your code. It allows you to design solutions, pass parameters and allows you build a single query on values passed.  Dynamic SQL has both pros and cons to it's design, but can also be a helpful tool. This presentation will walk through the steps of building dynamic tables, aggregating data in a pivot format and give you the first steps of writing a Dynamic Query.  We will also see how to use Dynamic SQL to build multiple databases across servers, alter a single table in multiple servers and add columns to a table, all through the magic of Dynamic SQL.
