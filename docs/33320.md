## Speaker: Todd Davis
## Title: SELECT job FROM firm WHERE hired = 'Yes'
## Abstract:
### Find out what hiring managers really want to see throughout the hiring process.  This session will walk through the basics that every successful candidate should know:  Resume tips, Job search and Interview tips.  Yes, recruiters and hiring managers view your LinkedIn page; but, did you realize they also view your twitter account, your blog, your Facebook and that webpage you designed freshman year in college?  If you are in a job search, considering one or just want to be prepared for one, then this session will be a great opportunity to find out what "they" are really looking for.
