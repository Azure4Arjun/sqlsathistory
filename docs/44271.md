## Title: Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Always Encrypted. This feature allows data to stay encrypted 100% of the time in transit to and from the server, can keep it encrypted at rest, and offloads the encrypt/decrypt operations off the server to be handled exclusively by the client. Always Encrypted can also be used with whole database encryption (TDE). In this presentation we will talk about what Always Encrypted is, how it is different from the encryption options currently available, and how database administrators can even be prevented from seeing the data! Demos will be done in both SQL Management Studio and in Visual Studio 2015.
