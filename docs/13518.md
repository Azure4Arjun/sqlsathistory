## Title: High Performance Statistical Queries
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 database Engine has so many business intelligence improvements that it might become your primary analytical database system. However, in order to get the maximum out of these features, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows some extremely efficient statistical queries that use the new Window functions and are optimized through proper indexing, including columnstore indices. We will also explain the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries as well.
