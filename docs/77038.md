## Title: Troubleshooting Service Broker
## Abstract:
### Restoring service broker from a live system to a test system can give you strange results.  From messages that refuse to send to messages that appear to send but never arrive.  We will be troubleshooting using SQL profiler and some DMVâ€™s to see what goes on in the background when service broker is misbehaving.  Nothing more worrying than performing a disaster recovery and having service broker messages not send.  We will also be doing a quick overview of what Service broker does and what is required for a service broker setup.  Once we have shown the profiler method of diagnosing problems, I will show a quicker and easier way to find and resolve service broker issues.
