## Title: Tracking Index Usage in SQL 2012 and SQL 2014
## Abstract:
### An important function in the role of DBA is one of Index Maintenance. This includes not only evaluating what indexes we should have, but also what indexes we do have, but don't really need. Since database usage patterns change over time, indexes that were needed once might not be needed now.

But I'm not really going to talk much about that. :)

In order to evaluate index usage, we need to have some way of gathering and storing index usage information over time. Unfortunately, many of the standard solutions are falling short. Why? You better come to the presentation and find out.
