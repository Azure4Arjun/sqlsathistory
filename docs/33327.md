## Title: Parallel Data Warehouse - Architecture Overview
## Abstract:
### In Nov.2010, Microsoft officially released SQL Server 2008 R2 PDW Edition. Parallel Data Warehouse is a true MPP (massive parallel processing) platform featuring an ultra shared nothing architecture. PDW is capable of delivering very fast query performance and can house up to 500 TB of data. This session will overview both the HW and SW architecture of the PDW appliance. It will explain how Microsoft and HP have engineered a solution using commodity HW and SW that can compete with more expensive platforms like TeraData and ExaData. Additionally, SQL DBAs will see where their current skillset is applicable to managing a PDW appliance.
