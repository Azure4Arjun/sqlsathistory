## Title: Unit Testing SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Unit testing is a widely accepted best practice, yet it is difficult to do well with SSIS packages. This session will focus on both the practice of test driven development as it applies to SSIS, and the tools for actually implementing it. It will cover in depth how to set up your development environment to support test driven development and what techniques can be used to make this practical for SSIS. You will also see how to automate the testing of SSIS packages, using the open source ssisUnit framework. The session will cover several of the common questions about automated unit testing, including how to handle test data , how to set up the environment for multiple developers, and how to make tests flexible.
