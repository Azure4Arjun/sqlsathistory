## Title: Quest: Realtime Monitoring  Workload Analysis with Spotlight on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this overview you’ll see how Spotlight on SQL Server gives you real-time performance alerts and brings together all of your critical SQL Server metrics into a single dashboard-style screen, color-coded for problem severity and clickable for rapid diagnostics.  You’ll also see how Spotlight’s Wait Event and Workload Analysis screens enable a deep dive into which queries caused exactly how much of each type of workload at particular times.
