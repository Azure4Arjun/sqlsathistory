## Title: Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### This session presents an overview of Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, massively scalable, low (single-digit millisecond) latency, fully managed NoSQL database service that is designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, Cosmos DB supports a schema-free data model, built-in partitioning for sustained heavy-write ingestion, and replication for high availability. But only Cosmos DB offers turnkey global distribution, automatic indexing, and SLAs for guarantees on 99.99% availability, throughput, latency, and consistency.

We tour many features of Cosmos DB, including its multi-model capabilities which allow you to store and query schema-free JSON, graph, key/value, and columnar data models. You’ll learn about global distribution, scale-out partitioning, tunable consistency, custom indexing, and more. We’ll also explore client development using the many available SDKs and APIs. Attend this session, and get up to speed on Cosmos DB toda
