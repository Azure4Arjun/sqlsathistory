## Speaker: Christopher Adkin
## Title: Super Scaling Clustered Index Inserts
## Abstract:
### Want to know how to go from 13,000 to 550,000 inserts per second on the same hardware ?, this session will show you how from key construction, reducing the overhead of SQL language processing, database engine tuning, delayed durability etc. During this journey core database concepts will be explained at a level not touched at in the SQL Server internals book and windows performance toolkit will be used to provide some deep insights into what the database engine is doing. This is a level 400 session which will cover so core database engine concepts and material that cannot be found anywhere else, for example it will explain why running a singleton on a particular NUMA node is faster than running the same insert on any other NUMA node.
