## Title: SQL Server DBA Quiz Show
## Abstract:
### You are invited to be a participant on the SQL Server DBA Quiz Show; this fun and interactive session will test your knowledge of SQL Server.  We will be using an online tool to allow you to submit your answers to questions in real time via a mobile device or laptop.  If you have ever played trivia in a bar or restaurant you'll be familiar with the setup for this.

This session promises to be fast paced and fun and hopefully you will even learn something.
