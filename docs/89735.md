## Title: So you want to be a consultant?
## Abstract:
### Have you been looking for new opportunities and thought about consulting, but aren't sure if it's for you? We'll compare the different types of consulting options and the pros and cons of each. We'll look at the risks involved – from finance to lack of stability – and how to mitigate them.

Ever wondered what the advantages of being a Full Time Employee (FTE) vs a consultant are? We'll look at ways to get the most interesting projects as a consultant, the perception of consultants in the workplace, keeping your skills up and more.

We'll explore the expectations for consultants and how you can overcome the imposter complex. We'll also look at the logistics for payroll, retirement and taxes so you can stay on the right side of the IRS without driving yourself crazy.

Then we'll review the various ways you can find new projects because waiting for someone to call you out of the blue just isn't enough.
