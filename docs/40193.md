## Title: Planning for Virtualization
## Abstract:
### This session will serve as a guide for database administrators who are considering virtualizing their SQL server instances (or are about to have that decision thrust upon them) and are unsure of the best approach. It will cover the basics of how to configure a virtualized environment for SQL server, make you aware of some of the common performance pitfalls and help to dispel some of the myths around managing database availability in a virtualized environment. At the end of the session you should have a good idea as to whether virtualization is the right choice for your database environment and a broad strategy for how to go about implementing it.
