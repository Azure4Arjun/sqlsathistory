## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on poor TSQL coding as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!
