## Title: Ethical Computing
## Abstract:
### This interactive discussion on Ethical Computing will inspire you to think about the cultural, social, and legal contexts of the digital experiences we create for humanity. Computing technologies including intelligent software and hardware artifacts are increasingly integrated into most aspects of our professional, social, and private lives. Intelligent Data technologies are running well in advance of public awareness, ethical reflection and regulatory frameworks.
