## Title: Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 started with query processing improvements called Adaptive Query Processing. Now, in SQL Server 2019 CTP2, there are additional improvements, and all of them are packed in a feature with the most promising name - Intelligent Query Processing. 

The intention of these improvements is to fix poor performing queries due to wrong cardinality estimations and other sub-optimal plan decisions, and hereby enhance query performance with almost no code changes. 

This session will cover briefly all these features: Batch and Row Mode Memory Grant Feedback, Batch Mode Adaptive Join and Interleaved Execution, Table Variable Deferred Compilation, and Approximate Query Processing.

The session will address questions such as do I need to tune queries anymore, does the IQP solves parameter sniffing issues and so on, and also suggest how much improvements you should expect with this promising set of feautures.
