## Title: Hack / Protect SQL Server - Come learn both.
## Abstract:
### In this session, I'll show you how to hack SQL Server using a simple C# console application and other tools. Most importantly, I'll show you how to protect these vectors that perhaps you're trying to use to safeguard sensitive data for GDPR compliance.

1. Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol
2. Dynamic Data Masking
3. Row Level Security (Yep...)
4. Database Source Control

Perhaps, you've seen these exploits before but do you really know how to reproduce them? Or, how to even protect yourself against them?

No worries, I'll show you the way along with a load test.
