## Title: Managing and Administering SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### This discussion addresses operational questions about using "SQL in the cloud" -- Questions like:  Just what is SQL Azure?  Where does it make sense  to use it (or not)?  HOW do I use it?  How do I get stuff in and out of it? How much does it really cost?  How do I manage it?  The session covers SQL Azure "how-to" and "why" questions from the viewpoint of operational DBA's and system architects (vs. developers).
