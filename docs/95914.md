## Title: A Lap Around SQL Server Big Data Cluster
## Abstract:
### The new release of SQL Server; SQL Server 2019 includes Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable compute and storage. This new architecture that combines together the SQL Server database engine, Spark, and HDFS into a unified data platform is called a “big data cluster.”
This session gives you an overview of what a SQL Server Big Data Cluster is, and what you can do with it. We look at the various components, (Kubernetes, Spark, HDFS, PolyBase, etc.), and what you can do with them.
