## Title: The Health Data Initiative: A Quick Start Guide for Entrepreneurs
## Abstract:
### After the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began publishing weather data for free download three decades ago, entrepreneurs across the country began to leverage this easily accessible data to power applications and services that benefit the American people: weather newscasts, mobile applications, insurance, and research. The same pattern of private-sector innovations occurred when Global Positioning System data became openly available in the 1980s. 

Now the Health and Human Services Department has made health data free and easily accessible through the Health Data Initiative -- making data from HHS' vaults (from CMS, CDC, FDA and NIH, to name a few sources) available to innovators across the country. In this session, we will explore what data is available, demonstrate how easily the data can be visualized with tools like Tableau or SSRS, and consider the field of opportunities available to improve an industry that is clearly under pressure for data-driven innovation.
