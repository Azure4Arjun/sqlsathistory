## Title: App to Azure in 60 Minutes
## Abstract:
### Have you been thinking about moving your custom web app to Azure? You'll need to consider several aspects, and this session focuses on some of the technical ones. An existing demo application developed in ASP.NET MVC with a SQL Server backend will be moved over to run in Azure App Service and Azure SQL DB. Along the way, you'll see how to navigate the Azure Portal, consider benefits of Visual Studio Team Services, and have opportunities to see how an app can take advantage of additional Azure services.â€‹
