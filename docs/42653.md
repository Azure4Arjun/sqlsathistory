## Title: #21 | TempDB: the forgotten pillar of Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
###  Tempdb is an integral part of SQL Server, and is often overlooked when trying to get the most out of your system. 

In this session we will go over what tempdb is used for, why it is a special type of database and how to use it to tune the performance of your overall system.

We will start with determining the best configuration, number of database files to use and the common performance issues that tempdb can indicate. We will then use these best practices to optimise our instance and performance tune our queries to make your system faster.
