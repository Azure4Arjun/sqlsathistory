## Title: The Optimizer Secrets of 860X
## Abstract:
### Debugging SQL using the 8600 Series of Trace Flags: You already know a thing or two about tuning a SQL query on Microsoft SQL Server. You can read an execution plan and know the most significant red flags to look for. And you have also learned about the important information revealed by SET STATISTICS statements. But you want to take it up another level! In this session, go even deeper with query tuning with three new lessons. First, we’ll examine a few new and seldom used features inside of SSMS specifically for query performance. Second, we’ll spend a bit of time learning query related DMVs and how to read query plans in directly within XML. Finally, we will discuss and demo a set of powerful Trace Flags, the 8600 series, that reveal additional details about how the query optimizer behaves as it processes a query.
