## Title: Cortana Intelligence Suite
## Abstract:
### The Cortana Intelligence suite is evolving every day. What began as data blob stores, no-sql providers, and SQL VMs, has grown into a full suite of offerings from Microsoft. Today you can build your entire data platform with ala carte purchases from Microsoft. In this session, I’d like to give you an overview of the services available as of the date of this presentation.  I’ll also share with you some ways the different offerings have been used in products I’ve worked on in the past, as well as some insights into how it will be used in the future.
