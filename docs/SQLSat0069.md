## Abstract:
### The dictionary defines a hierarchy as “any system of persons or things ranked one above another.” Classic examples that you may want to model in a database are an org chart or a bill of materials.  A less well-behaved example is the dependency of database objects (sysdepends).  These examples will be used to explain HIERARCHYID, recursive CTE (Common Table Expressions) and the Adjacency List Model.

# TDD – Thwarting Database Defects
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#69-Philadelphia-2011)
Event Date: 05-03-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Prof Devel / Dev (113)
## Speaker: Dennis Lloyd and Sebastian Meine .
## Title: TDD – Thwarting Database Defects
## Abstract:
### It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

This presentation introduces tSQLt, a framework for automated database unit testing. You’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain.

## Title: Become Bilingual! Oracle for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Speaker: Robert Pearl
## Title: I/O, I/O It's Why my Server's Slow - Waits  Queue
## Abstract:
### Based on the popular cover-story article appearing in SQL Server Magazine, Robert Pearl expands on ways to measure SQL Server's performance and present the information in a readable and useful format. He will bring us useful tips for getting and analyzing I/O information, and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks. In addition, Robert will scratch the surface and introduce performance tuning using a methodology called Waits and Queues, with respect to I/O. By using this methodology one can identify the best opportunities to improve performance, the so called “biggest bang for the buck”. These performance improvements are likely to have a significant return on the performance tuning time investment.

## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables-What you NEED to know!
## Abstract:
### Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, 'When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

# Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#69-Philadelphia-2011)

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube 
## Abstract:
### Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, we look at a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.
