## Title: Troubleshooting Blocking for Beginners
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Server is slow, and you suspect blocking. You need to set up simple, lightweight monitoring using free tools to document who’s holding locks, who’s stuck waiting, and which queries are causing deadlocks. In this session we will work through three common scenarios where blocking problems steal your performance -- and sometimes even kill your queries! You'll learn how to cut through the confusion with free scripts that reveal why queries are slowing down your SQL Server.
