## Title: Business Analytics with Microsoft Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Microsoft supplies us with many tools to produce business analytics with our companyâ€™s data. From health care to financial data, we need a friendly display of this valuable information in order for analyst to find what they are looking for or find new trends to focus in on.

It all starts with formatting your data in a dimensional model. Then, you need to be able to take that model and create a fast database in analysis services. This will consolidate the business rules and give us fast retrieval of the information.

PowerBI and Excel can be used by analysts to view this data and produced fixed dashboards and scorecards. But we also need to be able to create interactive displays for current data.
