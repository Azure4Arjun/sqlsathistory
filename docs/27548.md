## Title: New in SQL Server 2012 for Devs: SSMS and T-SQL
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 has a re-designed SSMS which is based on VS2010 Shell. There are many new features which should help us to be more productive. During the session I will demonstrate the new features in SSMS. I will also show a few existing but 'hidden' features. Then I will discuss a few new T-SQL features introduced in SQL Server 2012.
