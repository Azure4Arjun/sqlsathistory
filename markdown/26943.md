## Speaker: Todd McDermid
## Title: Real World Integration Services: Excel Spreadsheet
## Abstract:
### You rarely hear of a data integration project that doesn't involve a spreadsheet as a source document, a lookup reference, or an output. It's the ambiguously ubiquitous container for business data because it's so flexible and familiar to users. Unfortunately, the same features those business users crave tend to cause huge problems for data professionals.  
In this session we'll look at typical integration issues with Excel, explain why they occur, and show you more options than just the Excel Source or COM API.  In a world where spreadsheets are the "database of choice" for business users, knowing how to get SSIS to interact reliably with Excel is an essential skill.
