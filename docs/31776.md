## Title: Using PowerShell to Rapidly Deploy SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This session will cover a PowerShell project that is designed to allow organizations to rapidly deploy new SQL Server instances to their environment. The process includes automating all aspects of the SQL Server install from Operating System pre-configurations, the SQL Server install, to deploying standard SQL objects such as databases, tables, jobs, and stored procedures.
