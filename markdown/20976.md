## Speaker: Melissa Meyer
## Title: PowerPivot and Excel Reporting
## Abstract:
### In this session, learn how anyone with Excel experience can take advantage of PowerPivot, the free add-in for Excel, to quickly and easily turn data from different sources such as traditional databases, Analysis Services, Excel, or the web into a workable dataset.  Use this data for ad hoc analysis or to create visually impressive reports directly in Excel.  Then leverage SharePoint to automatically refresh the data and publish it to share with others in the organization.
