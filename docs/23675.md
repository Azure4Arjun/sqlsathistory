## Title: SSRS data driven subscription using SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services provides a powerful tool to render report based on information in a database table. But in order to use this feature, you are required to purchase an Enterprise license of SQL Server. In this session, we will create an SSIS package that renders reports to the file system based on values stored in the database.
