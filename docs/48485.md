## Title: Locking, blocking, and troubleshooting - Trial by FIRE!
## Abstract:
### NOLOCK is like the duct tape of SQL Server, it fixes everything. Want to run reports on a live production server, add NOLOCK. Do you have a large blocking chains, add NOLOCK. Actually, NOLOCK is NOT the answer and we will tell you why and give better solutions. 

In this session, we will deep dive into how isolation levels work and impact your concurrency. We will also cover how to troubleshoot locking and blocking issues within your system with the newfound locking knowledge. At the end of this session, you will be able to better understand how to identify and solve blocking chains in your system.

This is an interactive session, so please come prepared to help the class troubleshoot.
