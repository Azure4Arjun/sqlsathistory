## Title: SSIS Project Deployment: The T-SQL Way
## Abstract:
### Do you deploy SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Projects using the Integration Services Deployment Wizard? If you're looking for a repeatable deployment method that can be source controlled, there's another way...the T-SQL way! In this session, you will see a demonstration of T-SQL script deployment of SSIS projects, using stored procedures in the SSISDB database. You'll learn how to query the SSIS catalog to find your project configurations so they can be captured and source controlled. Take control of your SSIS deployments...the T-SQL way!


Prerequisites:
You should have previous experience with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package deployment and/or development.
