## Title: Performance Monitoring Analysis Services Tabular
## Abstract:
### Learn about how SSAS Tabular utilizes system resources and how to monitor its performance. 

You will see demos of how to use SQL Server Extended Events, Windows Perfmon, and SSAS DMVs to collect SSAS performance metrics. You will learn different options for storing and querying these metrics and how to use them to identify performance problems such as memory/processor bottlenecks. 

Finally you will see a demo of a set of Power BI reports that display the collected performance data.

While this session focuses on SSAS Tabular servers many of the concepts apply to SSAS Multidimensional servers as well.
