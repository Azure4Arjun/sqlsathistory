## Title: Power BI as a highway for your AI
## Abstract:
### Everybody talks about AI, many pretend they are using AI but how many people have you really seen doing it? Although AI is at its hype usually if you want to gain a benefit from its adoption you have to invest extensive resources and plan ahead at least several weeks. However the new AI features of Power BI offer extensive analytical capabilities which are easily applicable to a custom scenario even by a casual business user. In this session we will see how Power BI helps us get important insights via AI in a matter of minutes and without a necessity for a serious plunge in the field of statistics.
