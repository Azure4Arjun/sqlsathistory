## Speaker: Liviu Ieran
## Title: SQL Server - A Developers vs Admins story
## Abstract:
### When a query runs slow we have debates between developers and admins on "who's fault it is". Is the server too slow or badly configured - admins fault. Is the query written badly or the design of the database very poor - developers fault. 
During this presentation we will learn how to determine if a query can perform better and where to start looking for improvements based on the findings. It will include demo's which will hopefully engage the audience in debates and see that working together (devs and admins) is the best option.
