## Title: How to build an Activty based modelling system with SSAS Tabular and Power Pivot
## Abstract:
### The ability to distribute costs, including overheads, to activities in an organisation allows profitability to be calculated down to an individual activity, hence the ability to calculate the *real* client and product profitability.

In this session we take a look how you can create an Activity Based Modelling system using SSAS Tabular for the allocation model, and Power Pivot (over the Tabular Model) for end-user reporting.  Having the final report model in Power Pivot gives the end user the ultimate control over reporting, including adding other information possibly not even held with Information Technology.

I'll show you an example health care model where we replaced an expensive, difficult to understand and maintain SAS system, with a simple elegant solution (auditable) based on the Microsoft stack. The rules are table driven with allocated costs handling built in.

Having build the model with one of the finance team power users, they now own and understand the new system.
