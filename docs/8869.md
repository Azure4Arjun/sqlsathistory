## Title: Time Saving Tips  Tricks for SSMS 2012
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Management Studio can be really annoying sometimes.  Over the years a few really nice features have been added that you may have overlooked or just couldn’t find.  This session will focus some time saving tips and tricks for SSMS 2008 R2.  We’ll also cover a few great new features being introduced in SSMS 2012.  Since I can’t provide scripts for this session I guess I better get started working on some screen shots on where they hid all this stuff!
