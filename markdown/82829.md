## Title: Power BI Report Server: A Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### So, you think you know everything you need to know about the Power BI Report Server because you use traditional SQL Server Reporting Services.  Well, donâ€™t believe it.  In this session we are going to discuss topics such as Configuring Kerberos to resolve connectivity issues. We will discuss different authentication types, when you need them, why you need them and how to use them.  We will then jump into configuring your report server to host Excel workbooks using Office Online Server.   Finally, we will demonstrate how to configure an SSAS Power Pivot instance for the Excel data model.  In addition to these topics, we will discuss other advanced topics such as connectivity and high availability during this demo-heavy session.
