# Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Bonus
## Speaker: David Stein
## Title: Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make
## Abstract:
### Many data professionals understand the basics of Data Warehouse design, including Dimension and Fact Tables, slowly changing Dimensions, and the use of meaningless surrogate keys. However, it isn’t until you’ve created a dimensional model and put it into production, that you realize just how much of an impact seemingly trivial mistakes can make. They can hobble performance, allow inaccuracy, and perhaps worst of all, inhibit adoption and usage of the new system. 

Learn how to avoid many common mistakes, from someone who’s made them and then found ways to correct them.

# Have You Got the Urge to (T-SQL) Merge?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: David Stein
## Title: Have You Got the Urge to (T-SQL) Merge?
## Abstract:
### You’ve got data to load into an already existing table, perhaps a slowly changing dimension, and need a method that is simple, supportable, and performs well. The T-SQL Merge statement, introduced in SQL 2008, can do all of this and more. Many DBAs investigate it, but find it unintuitive, time consuming, or they couldn’t get it to perform well. This doesn’t need to be difficult; after attending this session you’ll thoroughly understand the fundamentals of the merge statement and how to write them. You will also leave with scripts which automatically write well formed merge statements for you in less than 1 minute, guaranteed. Come see how.

# Unraveling Tangled Code
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will emerge victorious!

## Speaker: John Sterrett
## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for your Big Data Problems.
## Abstract:
### Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. In this session you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Introduction to the XML Source
## Abstract:
### XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

# Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.

## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0
## Abstract:
### The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.

# SQL Server vs The World
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Rob Sullivan
## Title: SQL Server vs The World
## Abstract:
### While SQL Server is the 3rd most used database in the world, the landscape of how we build applications and the technology supporting them is quickly changing. As if keeping up with SQL Server isn't enough on its own, we now have to deal with the terms and technology that comes with NoSQL (Not-Only-SQL) as well as fast moving, feature rich open source Relational DBs. In this session, we will explore some of the popular data stores, why AppDevs like using them and how your skills in SQL Server translate to them.   Note: This session is geared towards OLTP systems. BI Solutions are NOT on the radar for this.

# Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-223)
Event Date: 24-08-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

## Speaker: Tim Costello
## Title: Agile Data Warehouse Design
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what should go in a fact table and what belongs in a dimension?  Have a suspicion that you’re forgetting important dimensions?  Wouldn't it be great if somehow your design was self-documenting?  In this session I’ll give you a couple new tools and show you a new way to look at your star schema.  We’ll go past ‘why’ to see ‘how’ dimensional design is a great fit with the agile principles.
