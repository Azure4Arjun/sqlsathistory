## Title: Dashboards - More Than One Way To Visualize Data
## Abstract:
### Presenting BI in a sophisticated look that is both user friendly and easy to use can be challenging. In this session I will review the three major types of dashboards (Operational, Strategic, and Analytical).  Using Visio, SSRS, SharePoint and Pyramid Analytics I will demonstrate examples of each of the dashboard types.
