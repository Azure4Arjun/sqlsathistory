## Title: Real-time Data Warehouse and Reporting Solutions
## Abstract:
### In this demo-rich session, we will explore database and ETL architectures that let you smoothly move data from your application databases across the enterprise in real-time to your data warehouse. You will see how to use SQL Server features such as replication, Change Data Capture, SSIS, and other techniques to extract, transform, and load data fast and dependably. We will develop an actual sample system during the session and discuss and walk through alternative real-time architectures. We will then see how to use Reporting Services to present data with a minimum amount of latency.
