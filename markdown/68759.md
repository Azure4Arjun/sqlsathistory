## Title: Excel with DAX
## Abstract:
### DAX is the new formula language (builds upon Excel's) supporting PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular mode. If you know Excel, you already know the basics of DAX (without even knowing it).  PowerBI also uses DAX for all the formula expressions.  We'll cover the basics of DAX, and go over some time intelligence functions.
