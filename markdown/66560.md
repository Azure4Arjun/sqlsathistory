## Speaker: Andrey Nikolov
## Title: Creating “Always Encrypted” applications
## Abstract:
### End-to-end encryption deserves end-to-end demo :)
In this session you will see not only what Always Encrypted is and how it works, but also how it looks like from developer’s perspective. It is a demo-heavy session and we will spend more time in Visual Studio and SSMS than in PowerPoint. I will show how to read encrypted columns in SSMS and how to do this in the application. You will also learn how to manage certificates in Windows Certificate Store and Azure Key Vault and why we need a separate security officer.
This session is intended for both developers and database administrators.
