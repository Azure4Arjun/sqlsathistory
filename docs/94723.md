## Title: An Introduction to Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### This will be an introduction to the Always Encryption feature introduced in SQL Server 2016 . Unlike Transparent Data Encryption Always Encrypted provides encryption in transit as well as encryption at rest. There will be a survey overview of both the operations and development side of Always Encrypted. However, the main focuses will be  porting considerations, certificate management, integrating Always Encrypted into a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD chain) and using Azure Keyvault for increased certificate security.
