## Title: SQL Server 2017 R and Python Integration - how do I do it and why would I want to??
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server 2016 we introduce language extension so that you can execute R scripts from within the SQL Server database engine. In 2017 we added support for Python. In this session I will go over the basics of setting up and executing this functionality, discuss the types of problems that you can solve with it, and when you might want to avoid it.
