## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: How to Think Like the Engine
## Abstract:
### You’re a developer or a DBA, and you’re comfortable writing queries to get the data you need. You’re much less comfortable trying to design the right indexes for your database server. In this session with Microsoft Certified Master Brent Ozar, you’ll role play as the database engine while Brent gives you queries. You’ll learn first-hand about clustered indexes, nonclustered indexes, execution plans, sargability, statistics, TempDB spills, and T-SQL anti-patterns.
