## Title: Building nTier Apps with Entity Framework - Part 1
## Abstract:
### Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the new Entity Framework and related services. With this new technology built into .NET, you can easily wrap an object model around your database and have all the data access automatically generated or use your own stored procedures and views. The session will demonstrate how to create and consume these new technologies from the ground up and focus on database modeling including views and stored procedures along with coding against the model via LINQ. Dynamic data website will also be demonstrated. Lots of code! Make sure to attend Part 2.
