## Title: Back to the Future: Accelerating the Cloud Migration of Legacy SSIS with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### This session focuses on the new features to unblock/accelerate cloud migration of legacy SSIS, such as 2008 or earlier versions, with Azure Data Factory (ADF). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will next show you how to enable the following scenarios: running SSIS packages stored in file shares as first-class activities in ADF pipelines, accessing Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance with OLEDB/ADO.NET connectors configured for Azure Active Directory authentication with ADF managed identity, configuring SSIS IR to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, running/debugging SSIS packages in ADF from SSDT, scheduling SSIS jobs in ADF from SQL Server Agent/3rd party orchestrators that invoke Azure-enabled dtexec.exe command line utility, etc.
