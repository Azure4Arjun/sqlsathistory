## Title: SQL Server 2008 Policy Managment Overview
## Abstract:
### In presentation I’ll first cover the basics of Policy Management by looking at the components focusing on several simple examples.   Then, we’ll discuss how Policy Management can be used to ensure your instances of SQL Server adhere to Microsoft’s recommended best practices for SQL 2000, 2005 and 2008.   We’ll see how we can import the readily available and predefined SQL Server best practices into the Policy Management umbrella.    Finally, we’ll look at the Enterprise Policy Management Framework which can be used to provide insightful and intuitive Reporting Services reports that can provide you with the policy adherence metrics for your SQL Server Instances across the enterprise.
