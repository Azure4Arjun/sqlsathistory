## Title: Tune the query, not the plan
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are a great resource when trying to tune a query, but often we get hung up on trying to fix what we consider to be 'bad' operators, for example table scans vs clustered index scans; scans vs seeks; sort operations.  In this session we will take a look at some misconceptions, step through what SQL Server is doing and see if we are actually improving the performance when we change the plan to have 'better' operators.
