# SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle - Part 1
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-506)
Event Date: 30-04-2016 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle - Part 1
## Abstract:
### A deep understanding of SQL Server internals makes it much easier to design and maintain efficient SQL Server solutions. Unfortunately, database professionals who lack this knowledge often make design and implementation decisions that adversely affect their systems.

This pre-conference session helps to address these issues and shows you how SQL Server components work under the hood, work together and communicate with one another, and most importantly, affect your systems. The session is based on the book “Pro SQL Server Internals” (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430259620), includes numerous demos, and discusses answers to the following questions:
- How does SQL Server store data and use indexes,

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Full day precon: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.
SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
•	Reliable
•	Resilient
•	Reusable
•	Maintainable
•	Well performing
There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.
In this full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices.

## Title: SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle - Part 2
## Abstract:
### The session can also help database pros who prefer to understand and fix the root cause of a problem rather than simply applying a bandage. The session is based on the book “Pro SQL Server Internals” (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430259620), includes numerous demos, and discusses answers to the following questions:

- How does SQL Server store data and use indexes, and how can you efficiently design and maintain them?
- What is the internal implementation of the various database objects, and when should they be used or not be used?
- How do you troubleshoot and fix concurrency issues and design efficient transaction strategies?
- How does SQL Server execute queries, and how are the most common plan-caching-related issues addressed?
- How do you quickly identify and resolve issues and bottlenecks in systems?

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load
## Abstract:
### Loading data via SSIS is great! It’s fast too! Until you hit a bad record. Then things aren’t so great. Now you probably have to waste time dumping and reloading all the data, or worst figure out where the bad record is and try a partial load.
In this session you will learn a simple method to load data via SSIS and identify, remove, and record those bad records allowing you to maximize the amount of data loaded while ensuring data integrity.

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Introduction to Biml
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Managing Security in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In the world of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), everything we do involves moving data from one point to another. However, very often the focus in SSIS package development is on functionality, not security. When building internal data transformation and movement processes, it is easy to forget that these operations broaden our security footprint, and must be actively managed to ensure that ETL doesn’t become the weak link in the security chain.

In this presentation, we’ll discuss the security features in SQL Server Integration Services, while reviewing best practices for securing your ETL infrastructure while providing enough (but not too much) access to those ETL assets. Among the topics we’ll cover:
	Properly securing connection passwords in SSIS
	Using package protection levels
	Restricting access to deployed packages
	Using role-based security for SSIS deployment and execution
	Using execution proxies

## Title: Data Partitioning for Database Architects and Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Data partitioning is a valuable technique that simplifies database administration tasks and helps meet availability and performance SLAs. In this session, Dmitri will cover several techniques and architectural approaches you can use to partition data in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. You will learn about partitioned tables, partitioned views and stretch databases introduced in SQL Server 2016. Finally, Dmitri will discuss the practical questions, such as how to move data between filegroups and disk arrays keeping tables online, implement sliding window data purge pattern and benefit from partitioning in the systems with mixed (OLTP/DW) workloads.

Event Date: 30-04-2016 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Ben Galluzzo
## Title: Working with SSRS Data-Driven Subscriptions 
## Abstract:
### SSRS Subscriptions are one of the great things within SSRS to automate delivery of reports.  However, one of the more powerful methods of further enhancing this automation is by use of data-driven subscriptions.  Data-driven subscriptions allow us to determine at run time what subscribers and other parameters can be used for automating generating these reports.

We'll begin with a quick overview of what the more familiar subscription functionality is and then quickly jump into what data-driven subscriptions provide for us.  We'll then demonstrate from beginning to end how to implement data-driven-subscriptions.  Lastly, we'll wrap up with any tips and tricks to enhance our process.

# Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-506)
Event Date: 30-04-2016 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Pro
## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

# How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-506)
Event Date: 30-04-2016 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.
