## Title: How I Became a BIML Believer
## Abstract:
### A year ago at SQL Saturday #285 in Atlanta I was introduced to BIML for the first time.  Leaving the session, I thought that it was a good tool for some small use cases;  I could not have been more wrong.  A few months later, I had a chance to use it on a project that made me believe in the true power of BIML.  In this session, my mentor on the project, and I will share what I learned in the project, and how you can have a few less growing pains on your way to becoming a BIML Believer. Here is some of what we will cover:
1.	How to import data from a flat file, and auto generate tables, views and SSIS packages based on metadata
2.	Utilizing metadata stored in a database
3.	Using BIML as a metadata store
4.	How to use BIML Annotations
5.	Helpful BimlScript extension methods
6.	Consolidating code with include files
7.	Helpful uses of C# Linq within BimlScript
 
All of the code and techniques in this session can be used with the free BIDS Helper add-in found on CodePlex.com
