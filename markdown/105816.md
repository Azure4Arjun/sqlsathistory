## Title: Introduction to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Extended Events have been available since 2008. At the time, there was a steep learning curve, and many folks decided to wait for a GUI. Even though a GUI was provided in 2012, many still depend on Profiler and Trace to understand what’s going on under the hood of SQL Server. 
During this session, you will learn how to make the transition to Extended Events. You’ll find out that it’s easier than you think!
