## Title: Database Restores - Lessons from the Real World
## Abstract:
### Having consistent, regular, verified backups are only a starting point.  When failures happen - and they will happen - can you recover your database?  In this presentation we will dive into the mechanics of database restores and discuss how choices made previously in database/server/backup design can have profound effects on how (and what) you can recover.  We will also discuss spectacular ways to fail miserably... all in the hopes of preventing those same failures in the future.
