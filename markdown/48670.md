## Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### How easy is it to hack a SQL Server?
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some creative ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks, and other ways), escalating priviledges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more.
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level).
