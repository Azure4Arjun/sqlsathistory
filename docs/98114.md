## Title: Running Windows and SQL Workloads on Google Cloud Platform
## Abstract:
### Google Cloud Platform enables you to exit non-differentiating, capital intensive activities like hardware procurement and maintenance. Retire hardware, improve server utilization and deploy your Windows and SQL Workloads in an open cloud environment.  Google enables extending your SQL database with advanced Server-less Analytics and AI/ML offerings. Deliver a complete platform without the burden of provisioning, scaling and upgrading infrastructure. This session will provide a walk-through of Google's approach to running Windows/SQL workloads in the Cloud and architectural patterns to address your needs.
