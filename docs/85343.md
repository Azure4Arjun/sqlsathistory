## Title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Power BI to detect Audience Emotion
## Abstract:
### Our facial expressions tell a million stories each time they change. Your eyes, your mouth, and the lines in your forehead all contribute to how you are feeling at that moment. Now imagine trying to quickly detect the emotion of ever person in an audience. Almost impossible or is it. Join me in this session where I will explain and demonstrate how to I used Microsoft’s Vision API and Power BI to build a vision-enable application to detect the emotions of individuals attending my presentation. This is a demo-heavy session that you don’t want to miss.
