## Speaker: Jeff Reinhard
## Title: Table Partitioning Intro and make that a sliding window too!
## Abstract:
### I walk-through the entire process of discovering a situation that would benefit from a partitioned table, designing the partition key and scheme, and implementation. Then also creating a sliding window partition, both adding new partitions and rolling out older ones, all on an AdventureWorks table, so that all the scripts can be used by participants later for practicing.
