## Title: Intro to tSQLt:  Unit Testing for Databases
## Abstract:
### How do I test my Microsoft SQL database logic? How do I integrate it with my build? What's the point of testing T-SQL, anyway? 

If you've ever had these questions, this introduction to the unit test framework, tSQLt, is for you. We'll address how to set up and run unit tests, fakes, and spy procedures. We'll also talk about how to structure your Visual Studio projects that use tSQLt, whether they're SSDT projects or the new ReadyRoll Core project type, available with Visual Studio 2017.  You'll learn how to integrate your tSQLt tests with the CI/CD pipeline using Visual Studio Team Services, as well as how to analyze code coverage.
