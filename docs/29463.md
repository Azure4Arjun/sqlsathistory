## Title: Strategies for Working with VLDBs
## Abstract:
### Very large databases (VLDBs) are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love. Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer and minor issues become major very quickly. In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to minimize your maintenance window requirements, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas. Demos will include how I set up a log shipping secondary and a replica of a 2 TB database in less than half an hour.
