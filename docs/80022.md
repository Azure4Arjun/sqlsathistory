## Title: Azure SQL Datawarehouse - The complete introduction
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Datawarehouse is not really the standard SQL Server that you could point your existing SSIS packages and reporting queries at and expect the same behaviour and performance.
So why is that? And what should you do different to get the most out of Azure SQL DB?
In this session I will explain what is happening behind the scenes and how it is architected. Combined with a bunch of demos you will gain a good knowledge about how it works, and if and how it would work for you in your situtation.
