## Title: Access-to-SQL Server Nuts and Bolts
## Abstract:
### At last year’s SQL Saturday (#249) we made the case for “Pumping up your Access application with a SQL Server back-end”.  This year we’re going to going to look at the code to make that happen.  We’ll pull the covers off a real-world application and see how we read and write SQL Server data using VBA.  We’ll also examine SQL code on the back end (views, stored procedures, triggers) and how to apportion the workload so that we’re taking advantage of the respective strengths of both Access and SQL Server in manipulating data and managing resources.  We might also get a peek at some performance metrics to see the impact of different indexing schemes and querying approaches.  Even though the topic is about interfacing Access to SQL Server, there will be a lot of emphasis on server-side coding and will be a good intro or refresher for people who just want to learn how to write T-SQL scripts.
