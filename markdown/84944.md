## Speaker: Bhavna Mangal
## Title: Azure CosmosDB and Tools
## Abstract:
### What is CosmosDB and why should I care about it? It is a schema-less JSON documents database engine with rich SQL querying capabilities. We will go over Cosmos database, collections, and documents creation. CosmoDB's SQL API supports relational and hierarchical queries. Azure CosmosDB Emulator is a free tool which provides local development with CosmosDB without connecting to the Azure portal. 
This session will also cover CosmosDB Explorer in Public View. It can be used to access the database with read-only or read-write permissions without requiring access to Azure subscription.
