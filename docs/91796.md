## Title: Data Wrangling for ETL enthusiasts
## Abstract:
### Data wrangling is a significant problem when working with big data, especially if you haven’t been exposed to the challenges it brings, or you don’t have the right tools to clean and validate data in an effective and efficient way. In this session, we'll explore data wrangling concepts and Azure data services to achieve the desired data transformations. If you are an ETL enthusiast or love SSIS, this session will take you through data ingestion-transformation techniques and tools available to build your modern data platform on Azure. We'll dive deep into using Azure Data Factory (dataflows) and Azure Databricks to transform data to meet your enterprise business needs.
