## Speaker: Paul Popovich Jr
## Title: SQL on Linux and Docker 101
## Abstract:
### By now you've heard that SQL Server is available on various flavors of Linux and Docker. Join me in this session to go through the basics of these technologies. I want to show you how to setup, install, configure, and have a database to insert some data into and query. Then I want to go through your tool management options. All in all I hope to leave you with the ability to take this to your shop to see where it might make sense to use in the future.
