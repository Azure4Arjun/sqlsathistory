## Title: The Froogle DBA – Combining SQL Features and Open Source
## Abstract:
### There are some really great toolsets for sale to help you manage your SQL Server environment.  If you want to learn more about them, then this is not the session for you.  While there is nothing wrong with buying a solution to solve your needs.  The Froogle DBA has a recipe for combining free software with built in SQL Server features to put together a framework that will give you the peace of mind you need to sleep at night.  That’s right, no software licensing needed beyond your SQL Server investment and you too could be maintaining and monitoring your systems with the best of them.
We’ll be combining Zenoss, MDW, CMS, and Performance Dashboard Reports to build a comprehensive monitoring and management framework in place.  With this flexible framework you will be able to keep systems up and sleep easier.
