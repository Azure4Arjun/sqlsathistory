I will cover how Microsoft CSS has been using Query Store, Extended Events, Azure SQL Database Advisor to help customers monitor and improve query response times when running their databases in the Microsoft Azure cloud. These learnings are all fruit of CSS support cases, and customer field engagements. This session includes several demos.
