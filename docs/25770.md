## Title: Using PowerPivot to Drive Quality into ETL Processes
## Abstract:
### Throughout the past year, we have effectively used PowerPivot, Data Explorer, and Power View to map, evaluate, and measure our ETL processes.  In this session, you will learn how PowerPivot can be a key component in verifying data quality.  You will also see how Data Explorer can help you shape data for test harnesses and test plans.  Finally, you will see how Power View in Excel 2013 can be used to easily share results of ETL projects, especially during the development process.
