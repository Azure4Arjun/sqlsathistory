## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: 3rd Normal Form: That's crazy talk!!!
## Abstract:
### Another DBA I work with has this Session Title on his whiteboard (Thanks Richard) at work. This session will be a step by step process of taking 2 different examples (Labatory and Fund Agreement) through normalization. The databases will be diagrammed and scripted out with primary, alternate and foreign keys, defaults, constraints and to Null or Not to Null. Some cool examples will be used to show just how powerful normalization can be and what SQL Server 2005/2008 features can enhance the delivery of information to the end user.
