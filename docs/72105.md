## Title: KEYNOTE:  IT and Development in the Next Five Years
## Abstract:
### How is our work going to evolve in the next five years? Join Richard Campbell as he takes you on a journey of looking into the past to inform the future - how new technologies are evolving and how they will impact how we write, operate, manage and measure software. Software may be eating the world, but we're the farmers, cooks and servers that bring it to the table - what can we expect in the next few years?
