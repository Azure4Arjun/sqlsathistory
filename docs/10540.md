## Title: SQL 2012 Always On-Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Always On offers a huge leap forward in terms of high availability. This sessions is a demo based introduction to the high availability changes in Denali emphasising key features and benefits. During the demonstration we will show how to seamlessly upgrade a database from SQL 2005+ to Denali with ZERO down time and then use the Always on features to simplify reporting, availability and disaster recovery. This session will be useful for anyone who is working in a high availability environment or currently using replication to provide reporting and looking for a neater solution.
