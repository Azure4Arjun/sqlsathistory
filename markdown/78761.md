## Title: Exploring SQL Server's Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s plan cache is one of the largest regions of memory and is used to store SQL and

you write and the way you invoke that code can have an enormous impact on how the plan cache is
maintained, tuned, and optimized. If you don’t do things right, you could end up shooting yourself in the
foot and making performance much worse. Attend this demo-loaded session to learn about 4 harmful
anti-patterns that developers frequently use without knowing their drawbacks.
This session will answer questions like:
- What’s currently in the plan cache?
- How often is the code in my plan cache being reused?
- Where are the big opportunities to save space in the plan cache?

There are a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier.
