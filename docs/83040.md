## Speaker: Hamish Watson
## Title: DevOPs and the Data Professional
## Abstract:
### You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at how both BI, DEV and DBA Professionals can benefit from it.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

â€‹Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Due to their complexity database changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise DevOps.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to running databases hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement DevOps processes in their database and BI deployment pipeline.
