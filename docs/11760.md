## Title: Doing More With Less-SQL Server Policy Based Mgmt
## Abstract:
### Do more with less… sound familiar? In this demo rich introduction to Policy Based Management presentation we will be going over what Policy Based Management is and how you can use Policy Based Management and a Central Management Server to evaluate your daily, weekly, and monthly checklists against your entire SQL Server environment.  We will be reviewing some of the “out of the box” policies as well as creating some custom policies that you might be interested in evaluating against all of your SQL Server instances.
