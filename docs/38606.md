## Title: Strategies for Working with Texas-sized Databases
## Abstract:
### Very large databases (VLDBs), or just "databases" as they're known in Texas, are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love.

Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer, there's more locking, more logging, and minor issues become major very quickly. In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to fit index maintenance and integrity checks into a thin maintenance window, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas.
