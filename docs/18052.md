## Title: Using PowerShell To Document Your SQL Envronment
## Abstract:
### We've all been here before: 
- You're the DBA and it seems like every day someone is telling you about some other server you never knew existed but you're responsible for 
- You're the consultant and you want to know what SQL Servers your new client has but they can't tell you 
- You're the IT Manager and your CTO asks you for an inventory of every SQL Server running in production 

How do you go about figuring out where the SQL Servers are, how they're set up, and what they're doing? 

This session will give you the answer by demonstrating how to use PowerShell and SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) to discover and document all of your instances - no PowerShell experience required!
