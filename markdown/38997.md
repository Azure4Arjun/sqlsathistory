## Title: Creating Access 2013 Web Apps in SharePoint with SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### Access 2013 web apps are fully integrated with SQL Azure.  When you create a web app on SharePoint, Access Services will create SQL Azure database that houses all of your Access objects. This opens up new opportunities for SQL developers to extend and work with the data using Access or other applications, including mobile.  In this session you will learn how to easily create an Access Web App with automatic views, view the online development environment and see a live, production web app in action.  Weâ€™ll also discuss different ways of extending web apps through the use of hybrid applications and integrating office web apps and the best ways to utilize Access Web Apps within your organization.
