## Title: An Introduction to Azure Data Studio
## Abstract:
### This session will provide a high level overview of Azure Data Studio and highlight some of the differences from SQL Server Management Studio. We cover saved connections, how to get both the actual and estimated Execution plans, workspaces and one of my favorite features, Notebooks.  We also go over what an extension is and why I would want to use them.
