## Title: Azure, PowerShell, and SQL Server Virtual Machines
## Abstract:
### While the web portal makes it easy to deploy SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, there are a number of benefits to using PowerShell to do the job. This session will introduce Azure PowerShell command-lets and how to create a basic Azure infrastructure to support a SQL Server VM. We'll include the Azure Resource Manager, how to use ARM VM templates and Custom Script Extension, and how users can modify an existing Azure Gallery template. Desired State Configuration (DSC) will be covered to complete the Azure Powershell automation toolkit, allowing attendees to automate the deployment of dozens or more SQL Server virtual machines. Finally, we will configure Availability Groups and explain their eccentricities in the Azure environment as well as how to make them work effectively.
