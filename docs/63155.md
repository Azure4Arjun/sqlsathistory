## Title: Elegant T-SQL Solutions for Real World Problems
## Abstract:
### T-SQL can help solve many problems you are faced with at your job.
Each problem can have many solutions, but not every solution is simple to write, understand and maintain, and not every solution is good in terms of performance.
In this session, we will look at real world problems and solve them using T-SQL. We wonâ€™t settle for just A solution, but show elegant, simple solutions that will yield optimal performance.
