# Windowing Functions: Shedding some light
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-920)
Event Date: 02-11-2019 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: DBDev: Development, Tools, Scalability, Query Tuning and Indexing
## Speaker: James McGillivray
## Title: Windowing Functions: Shedding some light
## Abstract:
### One of the simplest ways to enhance the value of the information we provide is to add context. Supplementing each data point with information from a larger data set is a common way of adding this context. In T-SQL, we achieve this by using Windowing Functions. 

In this demo-heavy session, we will walk through the uses of Windowing Functions, from simple row orders to more complicated calculations like rolling averages. We'll explore each keyword in turn, building more sophisticated functions as we do. Each concept is illustrated in a visual, and T-SQL example so it is clearly understood.

So whether it's tracking a value against the previous row, creating running totals, or a rolling sum, when you walk out of this session, you'll be able to write a windowing function to make it happen.

## Speaker: Aaron Cutshall
## Title: Defining What's Normal -- The Basics of Database Normalization
## Abstract:
### Determining how to efficiently design database structures for a given application has always relied on the same old answer: "It depends!" So, how do you determine what level of normalization your data requires?  This session will review the principles of data normalization, show the impact that normalization can have on performance and data integrity, and just as importantly, show you when it's OK to break the rules and denormalize.  We will cover some case situations where it's better not to be normal!

# Certificates and EXECUTE AS - Putting Permissions Inside Stored Procedures
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-920)
Event Date: 02-11-2019 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: DBAdmin: Administration, Deploy, Manage, Repair, Server and Database Configuration, HA/DR
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Certificates and EXECUTE AS - Putting Permissions Inside Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### The basic mechanism when we want to give users access to data or actions in SQL Server in a controlled way through stored procedure is ownership chaining. This is something we use everyday as SQL workers, although we may not be aware of it. Every once in a while, we run into situations where it seems that it is not sufficient to put a statement in a stored procedure, but that users need to be granted explicit permissions â something we may not always be comfortable with, because that would permit the users to do things we do not want them to be able to.

There are two additional mechanisms in SQL Server we can employ in these situations: certificate signing and the EXECUTE AS clause. In this session I will start by exploring how ownership chaining works and its limitations. I will then proceed to explore the other two options and I will particularly focus on certificate signing, as this is the preferred method. At first it may seem overly complex, but I will show how it easily can be automated. EXECUTE AS may seem simpler, but I will point out potential problems with it, not the least if you try to use it on server level and consider to set the database as TRUSTWORTHY.

This session is directed towards both developers and DBAs, as this session deals with problems you may face in either roles.

# Data Privacy and Data Security in a Data-Driven world
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-920)
Event Date: 02-11-2019 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Professional Development: Career, Skills, Interviewing, Managing, WIT
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: Data Privacy and Data Security in a Data-Driven world
## Abstract:
### New advances in technology coupled with the rate of change in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Privacy and Ethics at the forefront of public consciousness â forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained, and constantly evaluated. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial Intelligence, and big data processing are providing new business opportunities that must also account for privacy and ethics issues while maintaining a balance with compliance, security, and integrity of data. 
But what are the issues that individual data professionals should be aware of to avoid reputational damage to their companies and themselves? And what are the tools that can help them in their endeavors? 

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks.

## Speaker: Oliver Engels
## Title: Common Data Model - Our new buddy for Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Common Data Model as the foundation of Power BI Dataflows and as part of the Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe, seems to be a pretty good move from Microsoft. We want to take a closer look to this approach. In this session we show how the Common Data Model will allow you to combine Self-Service ETL and Corporate Data Engineering. We will show you how Power BI and more specialised tools like ADF, DataBricks etc. can work together on the Azure Data Lake with one common model. We than extend this and show, what opportunities this standard brings to you, when we unleash the possibilities you have on managing Data Quality and Governance. We also will have a look in how you integrate CDM in a DataOps  Methodology.

Event Date: 02-11-2019 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI Arch/Admin: Design, ETL, SSIS, EDW
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

## Abstract:
### Data science seeks to uncover actionable data relationships  to solve pressing organizational needs e.g. improved cyber security behavior, and this talk presents three steps for doing just that. The aim  is an exemplary theory driven approach to data evidence of better preparedness against cybersecurity threats. We will present a theory of cybersecurity behavior and how data was collected from training participants then stored in SQL server for analysis in R with a ML classifier. The ML random forest classifier implemented in R is used to analyze survey responses to theoretically-inspired questions. It creates a preferred multi-model integration that can be reused on future data to identify the individuals less likely to participate in the security training who may also be a higher security risk. The talk concludes by summarizing the three tips for actionable data science projects covered here. A short video will preview for SQL Saturday attendees.
