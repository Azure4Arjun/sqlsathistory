## Title: SQL Automation – In the Cloud, On-Premise, and Hybrid
## Abstract:
### They’re all SQL jobs, but some of your critical jobs run on local SQL Servers, while others run on Azure SQL. Still others execute across both environments. Will you maintain separate SQL Agents or other schedulers to automate these jobs? Or, will you will leverage a centralized solution? JAMS gives you complete control over every aspect of your SQL jobs – their source, their schedule, their history, their status – regardless of environment.

In this working session, we will walk through defining, executing, monitoring, and logging SQL jobs with JAMS. Then, we’ll show you how to leverage one centralized automation solution to manage all your SQL jobs, and combine them into powerful business workflows that span on-premise, cloud, and hybrid instances.
