## Title: Making sense of Storage modes and Connection types in PowerBI
## Abstract:
### If you've been around PowerBI you should already know what Import, Direct Query and Live Query are. Probably you've looked for the differences, you've read for something called Query Folding and if you've been following the news - you should have heard about composite models and the Dual storage mode and its partner in crime - the Aggregation table. But how to make sense of all of those? How to choose between them? When one is better than the other? Well, I am trying to find that out myself, and I have some facts to share with you. In the session we will compare Import with DQ and LQ, I'll show you the usage of Aggregations, we will talk about Dual mode and most importantly, I will share some real-life scenarios to wrap things up.
