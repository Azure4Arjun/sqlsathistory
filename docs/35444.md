## Title: Tips Tricks For Administering SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I've developed a toolbox of scripts that I rely on to give me insight into disk space, database file growth, backup status, job status, and login management.  Some of these I've shared on mssqltips.com, others are seeing the public light for the first time.  Attendees go home with scripts they can immediately put to use in their organizations.
