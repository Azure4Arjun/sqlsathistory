## Speaker: Aaron Bertrand
## Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices
## Abstract:
### In this session we will go over several bad habits that are quite
pervasive in the SQL Server community, and show with demos and samples why
these habits can be bad.

  We'll also illustrate some good habits that are less common and why they
should be adopted.

  The goal is to have every user in the room walk away with immediately
actionable knowledge to improve their existing stored procedures, raise
their overall T-SQL skill, and change the way they think about writing
code.
