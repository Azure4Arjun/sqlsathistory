## Speaker: Zach Mattson
## Title: Powershell Eye for the Monitoring Guy
## Abstract:
### Server monitoring can be expensive and is generally licensed for only critical production servers. In this session, learn how to utilize Powershell along with SMO to not only be proactive, but productive in monitoring the servers in your environment.  Attendees will come away from the session with an understanding of how to read the server event logs, check backups, and collect performance metrics.  This will be useful for general monitoring in your environment and can also be used for collecting data in a physical to virtual migration.
