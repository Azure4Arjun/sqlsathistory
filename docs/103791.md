## Title: Deep Learning advancements and why data is the key ingredient of AI revolution today?
## Abstract:
### This session explains how recent development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes gap between human and machine smaller than ever before.

Traditionally AI systems have been tested in chess and the same has been done to demonstrate the power of AlphaZero. But, instead of playing against human, it played against the best (at the time) chess program Stockfish. It learned about the game by playing a large number of games with itself, learning in the process.

Session will also explain what is so revolutionary in AlphaZero approach to AI and how this new approach can be used in different areas of processing visual information, bio-medicine, autonomous driving, robotics and AI generated images/videos of humans. IoT and large amounts of machine-generated data is the main ingredient of AI today.
