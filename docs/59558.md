## Title: Running SQL Server in AWS
## Abstract:
### Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest public cloud hosting provider with many companies successfully running SQL server on AWS infrastructure. In this session, we explore the options available to you for running SQL server in AWS, either as an RDS managed service or using dedicated EC2 instances. We document the different storage options, HA strategies and maintenance caveats to be aware of. We will also detail various approaches to licensing you can take when running SQL server in AWS.
