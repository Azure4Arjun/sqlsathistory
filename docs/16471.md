## Title: When a Strange Server Calls
## Abstract:
### Have you checked the databases lately? It could be that you’re new on the job, or you’ve inherited a set of servers from another team. Maybe things have just been busy lately. Any which way, you’ve got a SQL Server instance (or five) that may have issues, may have backups, may have maintenance…or not. How do you start getting to know an instance? We’ll go over scripts and methods to gather and prioritize important information about your server, so you don’t have to be afraid when the server calls.
