## Title: SSAS 2012 Tips/Tricks with Tabular Schema Compare
## Abstract:
### Targeted at experienced SSAS practitioners, this session covers topics geared to enterprise implementations such as tabular schema compare, deployment of large tabular models, branching/merging models, and standardization of models in the enterprise. BISM Normalizer, a free tool for the SQL community, is included.

Also contrast multidimensional features with tabular equivalents (typically using DAX): many-to-many dimensions, measure expressions, semi-additive measures, default members, non-aggregatable hierarchies, IgnoreUnrelatedDimensions, conditional formatting, member properties, CurrentMember vs filter context, MDX vs DAX.

Some demos perform currency conversion; all are relevant to a wide range of business scenarios.
