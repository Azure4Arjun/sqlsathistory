## Title: SQL Server 2008 R2 Overview
## Abstract:
### "R2"? What does THAT mean? Is this a "full" release or not? Buck Woody, Microsoft's real-world DBA and all around Gadfly will regale you with the explanation of such acronyms as "DAC", "UCP" and "MDW", and he'll explain what StreamInsight, Master Data Services and PowerPivot can really do for you. You'll take a quick tour of the features you should know about in SQL Server 2008 R2, the version of SQL Server that just couldn't wait for another year.
