## Title: Sponsored - Maximum SQL Server on VMware Performance
## Abstract:
### Your business-critical SQL Servers should not suffer from virtualization-related bottlenecks. When properly architected and managed, the principal bottleneck to performance of these SQL Servers should be only limited by code. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. Layers like virtualization can detract from database performance if not managed correctly, and they are tough to identify.

This session is packed with many live examples of tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.
