## Title: You don't need Talent to Succeed
## Abstract:
### You don't need Talent to Succeed, but Everything else Counts

This session helps you trigger our natural abilities that go unused for years.  Once you discover that these are already part of you (us), you will be able to apply them to advance your career, your relationships and your life. You can manage your career and your life—it’s not about balance. Talent is overrated.
