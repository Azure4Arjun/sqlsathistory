## Title: Increase of Efficiency in Product Classification Process through Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Within Shared Service Centers, during the last few years a new tendency has disrupted how business is carried out day-by-day. It has the catchy name of "Robotic Process Automation" (RPA), and consists of taking a process from the process of being done mostly manually to being completely automatic. 

In this case, we are proposing the automation of manual work done by a group of ~10 people, who on a daily basis have to classify products for customs purposes, based on the products' characteristics... this takes hundreds of hours per month to complete. Our proposal is to take the products' data, both the text description plus other qualitative data like product specs, and apply techniques to automatically determine what is the customs classification that the product should have.

Accuracy expectations for the process are above 98%, so the automated classification has to be near-perfect. Additionally, for the process to be fully automated, we can turn to features of SQL Server 2016.
