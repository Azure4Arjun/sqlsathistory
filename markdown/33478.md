## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server Service Broker
## Abstract:
### We will take a look at SQL Service Broker, the built-in asynchronous messaging subsystem provided with SQL Server.  We will examine new terminology as well as get a grounding in how we can setup and use Service Broker for messaging applications.  We live in an increasingly interconnected world and having a system that can handle intermittent connections and asynchronous processing can solve many business problems.  And if MySpace can use it to pass hundreds of millions of messages around their system per day, it can probably do whatever you need it to do as well!  Plenty of code in this presentation too.
