## Title: Exploring the All-New SSRS 2016
## Abstract:
### For years, SQL Server Reporting Services chugged along with very few updates. Although it remained a reliable and popular reporting tool, the feature set largely remained unchanged for a decade. With the release of SQL Server 2016, everything changed. Microsoft delivered a brand new SSRS. This session will review and demonstrate the new features of SQL Server Reporting Services 2016. You'll walk through the essential changes in SSRS, from the new report manager to the new visualizations. You'll also discuss the SSRS ecosystem and how it fits together with PowerBI and other Microsoft reporting/analytics platforms.
