## Title: Together is better: Azure SQL Datawarehouse  Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### In this session we will see which are the advantages that we will find working with Azure SQL Datawarehouse and Azure Analysis Services in scenarios with a high data volume, typically with tables that have billions of rows. 
- How Azure SQL Datawarehouse works, which differences we must bear in mind if we compare to an on-premise SQL instance.
- Tips to take into account in an on-premise to cloud migration
- Why Azure Analysis Services? How does it performs in scenarios with billions of rows? Is the development environment mature enough?
