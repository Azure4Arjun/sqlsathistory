###  I have implemented at several client. In implementing MDS   I have extensive experience in creating data quality, data governance and MDM/MDS accelerators I published many articles.

Accelerators can take many forms generally there either software products that accelerate development and/or techniques that embody data aware and code generation capabilities.

In developing the MDS application extracting data, applying data quality, loading MDS entities, and extracting data from MDS, we have applied these techniques, that I have published articles on.

The basic principle we applied this to be a data aware (data profiling)and create SSIS code that will self generate loan pr
