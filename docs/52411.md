## Speaker: Ginger Grant
## Title: Administration, Security and Data Management in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Attendees will learn Power BI’s administrative features providing security and best practice methods for development and deployment. As Power BI does not use network security, the importance in things like Group Workspaces to ensure visualizations aren’t lost when people leave the organization are discussed. Practices to increase scalability over time are reviewed.  Development of content packs are explored to increase adoption of Power BI while establishing data access standards using scheduled refreshes with gateways. Licensing strategies and use of One Drives and their impact on update strategies are also reviewed.
Without any guidelines, many organizations proliferate data models over time leading to complaints about data accuracy as updates can be random. Learn processes for the use of gateways and their role to prevent rampant data model and create the ability to maintain the quality of the visualizations over time to provide a usable data framework for Power BI.
