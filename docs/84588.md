## Speaker: Trey Johnson
## Title: Deciding to keep your BI Data Platform On-Premises
## Abstract:
### The world is going to the cloud and there is plenty of good reason for it, but NOT every IT workload should go to the cloud and your BI is no different. Maybe you arenâ€™t ready, maybe your organization feels fully invested in your current On-Prem infrastructure. Maybe there is some fear of the unknown.

The speaker will tackle these challenges and help you, the attendee, understand how and when to decide to stay On-Premises or move to a Cloud or a Hybrid solution. As an attendee, you should have the information to comfortably determine what is right for your organization today, and have a plan for the future.

Attendees will understand what On-Premises benefits are available exclusively to them
Attendees will understand where Cloud and Hybrid solutions complement their existing deployments 
Attendees will be in a better position to explore moving beyond their On-Premises deployment
