# Query Optimizer internals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#269---Exeter-2014)
Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Dave Ballantyne
## Title: Query Optimizer internals
## Abstract:
### The query optimizer is at the heart of SQLServer.  Without it SQLServer would be a vastly inferior product, queries would have to be manually tuned at each and every turn, and generally speaking, the optimizer protects us from the complexities and mechanics involved.

Much of the optimizer's internal workings are hidden from the user, but can be revealed by using a selection of undocumented trace flags to gain further knowledge and insight into how your queries and data are processed to create a plan.

This session will be a deep dive into the optimizers' internals and not for the feint of heart.

## Speaker: Emil Glownia
## Title: How to become a BI Developer? 
## Abstract:
### This is one of the most frequent questions I get from our website visitors (mainly as we provide BI Tutorials).

I have become a BI Developer and I would like to share my experience and thoughts (and get yours) during this session, which will include:

1) We are not born BI Developers and anyone has a chance to become one!
2) It is not easy but it is easier when you have a clear directions how to get there!
3) Permanent vs. Contractor brief explanation of pros and cons!
4) Money is important aspect so we will talk about salaries and contract rates!
5) My journey to becoming a BI developer was not easy and I have started from not knowing English (in 2005) and any aspects of IT and I worked very hard (and Katie; my wife was my main success factor!) but I no longer want to be a BI Developer so last point is where to go next?

# Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#269---Exeter-2014)
Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity
## Abstract:
### We’ve all dealt with them: nightmare queries, huge, twisted monsters that somehow work, despite being ugly and unmanageable. The time has come to tame these beasts, and the solution is available now, in SQL Server 2012.
New T-SQL functions offer out-of-the-box solutions for many problems that previously required complex workarounds. Paging, Running totals, Moving aggregates, YTD, and much more comes at the power of your fingertips in SQL Server 2012. The only thing you need to do is learn the syntax. And that is exactly what this session is all about: a thorough description and explanation of the syntax, and loads of demos to demonstrate how you can use all these new features.
Attend this session to boldly take SQL Server where it has never gone before!

## Speaker: Ian Meade
## Title: Dynamic code for efficient searching 
## Abstract:
### Illustrate how multipurpose queries can lead to issues with scalability and performance. Show a few alternatives that will work for smaller and simpler queries while highlighting their limitations for more complex queries. Then work through building a dynamic search query to resolve the identified performance issues. Touching on: • Testing. • Tuning each part of the query in isolation. • Plan cache re-use • Security – SQL injection attacks and authorisation / code signing. • Possibly, mentioning greater re-use and extendibility.

## Speaker: Kevan Riley
## Title: Uncovering the hidden gems in execution plans
## Abstract:
### We all know that the execution plan is central to understanding query performance, but the way we view the execution plan hides lots of good, useful information from us.   The plan is an XML document and knowing what attributes to look for can give you a better window onto your query's performance.  In this session Kevan will cover the attributes that he looks for, what they mean and what actions to take.  We may even get a sneak peak of what's to come in SQL 2014 too.

Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Neil Hambly
## Title: Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy
## Abstract:
### We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. 
When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

## Speaker: Pieter Vanhove
## Title: 1, 2, 3, … wait… 1, 2, 3, … many… SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Quote: “A good DBA is a lazy DBA”. When you have to manage a few SQL Servers, it’s not that hard to be a lazy DBA and to automate your day to day activities. But when you have to manage over 100 instances, it can become a tough job. Just imagine how you will deploy a new maintenance job on all your instances? Are you going to connect to each server one by one? Not really… Microsoft provides an enhanced set of multi-server management tools. The purpose of this sessions is to point out which SQL Server tools you can use for multi-server management. The session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what features can be helpful in your environment.

Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Peter Larsson
## Title: Remodel your old EAV design
## Abstract:
### Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow.
After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model.

There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB.

# Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#269---Exeter-2014)
Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
## Abstract:
### Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: SQL Impossible: Restoring/Undeleting a table 
## Abstract:
### Yes, you read the title right. 
No, it's not about the usual "one table per partition" and "restore full backup then copy the data over" methods.
No, there are no 3rd party tools involved. Just you and your SQL Server. 

Yes, it's crazy. No, it's not for production purposes. And yes, that's why it's so much fun.
Prepare to dive into the world of data pages, log records, deletes, truncates and backups and how it all works together to get your table back from the endless void.

## Speaker: Richard  Munn
## Title: Policy-based what ? (Or how I learned to stop worrying and love PBM)
## Abstract:
### Beginning with SQL Server 2008, Policy-based Management was added to the DBAs toolkit to ease administration, but it only goes so far. This session will cover the principles of PBM, and we'll take a look at how we can make it *work* for us, as opposed to just telling us something is not right. We'll cover PBM and it's insides, Alerts, Operators, Scheduled Jobs, and demo a real-world use when setting up databases.

## Speaker: Stuart Moore
## Title: PowerShell for the curious SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA you've probably noticed more and more talk of PowerShell over the last few years. You might have never used it, or perhaps you've even downloaded a few scripts to use, or started reading a tutorial, but aren't really sure what it can do for you?

Then this session is for you. Trying something new for SQL Saturday Exter 2014, this "session" is in fact 2 sessions long (don't worry, you'll still get a break for coffee half way through). 

By the end of them you should have a better understanding of what PowerShell is, and how it can be used with SQL Server, so you can  start writing your own scripts or have a better understanding of how a script you've downloaded works

Session 1 will be a easy high level introduction

## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: Automate your SSIS development with BIML
## Abstract:
### Ever tried to import a file with the Import/Export wizard?
Or created a bunch of SSIS packages to process a data warehouse load?
Then you know how much work it is to specify the metadata correctly just to create a package that actually works.
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a descriptive language which looks at your metadata and just created the packages for you?
This is what BIML is all about. 
In this session I explain what BIML is, how it works and I'll show you how you can generate your packages and quickly respond to changes.
You can expect a demo rich session with lots of notes from the field and practical examples.
This is not just for BI developers, DBA's or SQL dev's who need to import or export data occasionally will learn some quick and easy tricks as well.

## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy
## Abstract:
### Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.
