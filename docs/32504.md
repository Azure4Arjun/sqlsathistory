## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Managing Database Schemas With VS201 DB projects
## Abstract:
### Most developers agree that the database is the most important component in a typical application, yet the processes for managing changes to database objects as part of the development cycle are often rudimentary or inexistent.
In this session Rafael explains how you can use Visual Studio database projects to have better control over your database development cycle and  reduce the risk and complexity involved in managing  schema changes, testing and deployment.  He will talk about the pros and cons he has experienced when using VS DB projects in his last projects, and will highlight some of the  improvements available in the latest version of the tool. 
This session showcases VS 2010, but most the content remains relevant for VSDB2008 GDR2
