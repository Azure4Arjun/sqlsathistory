## Title: SQL Azure + Azure Machine Learning to predict Home Values - HOL
## Abstract:
### During this hands on lab we will connect an Azure Machine Learning experiment to a SQL Azure instance, import the data, train two machine learning models, compare the two and publish a production model as a web service.  There will also be an overview of how the data was obtained.

The data is data from Zillow using F# and Azure Cloud Services, we will be predicting the value of homes based on the data collected.
