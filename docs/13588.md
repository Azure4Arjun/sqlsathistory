## Title: Remove the Linked Server 2 Hop Limitation by Implementing Kerberos
## Abstract:
### Some of us have had to experience SSPI, untrusted domain, for login failed for NT Authority\Anonymous Logon errors can have come to the conclusion that there is a limitation when using windows authentication and linked servers. This is actually a limitation to the authentication method and not the linked servers. By implementing the new Kerberos authentication method in your Active Directory environment, you can overcome this 2 hop limitation.
