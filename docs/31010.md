## Title: Dallas: Microsoft's Data Marketplace
## Abstract:
### At PDC 2009, Microsoft announced "Dallas", a Data-as-a-Service offering that leverages the Windows Azure cloud computing platform. "Dallas" makes well-known and vetted public and commercial data sets from entties such as the Associated Press and Data.gov available to the development and data analysis communities. This session explores getting started with "Dallas" and accessing its data sets programmatically and via Excel 2010's PowerPivot feature.
