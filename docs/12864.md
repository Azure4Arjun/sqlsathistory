## Title: Fill Factor: Performance or Nuisance?
## Abstract:
### We expand on a little known but widely modified feature of SQL Server. Fill Factor is something to address in performance tuning after all the low hanging fruit has been addressed. This is not a deep dive into the underlying mechanics of how SQL Server works, but a softer more useful approach to this subject. We will be looking into why changing this could be either good or bad for your environments. This presentation is useful for DBAâ€™s as well as developers trying to get a little more out of their servers.
