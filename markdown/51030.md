## Title: Streaming data: from signal to query
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at techniques for transforming and refining data in a stream with Reactive Linq.
We will use example data coming from a mock-up parking garage and send it to SQL Server leveraging in-memory objects.  We will also let our data streams leverage Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning.
