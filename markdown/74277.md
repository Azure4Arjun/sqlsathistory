## Title: 45 min to build your first SSRS report
## Abstract:
### Does this sound like you? You've been BI curious and now you've been given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA or DBA Dev and could use a report to reduce daily task. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed.  We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2016. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output.
