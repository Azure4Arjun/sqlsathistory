## Title: Practical Powershell for the Harried DBA
## Abstract:
### We DBAs are a busy lot. As time passes, it seems like we're being asked to configure and manage more and more servers and databases without an increase in headcount. What can we do to keep up? In this session, you'll learn about Powershell and how you can use it to automate your routine (and not-so-routine) tasks. After covering the basics, we'll get into some practical scenarios and compare the Powershell approach with the alternatives.
