## Speaker: Jacquelyn Keeper
## Title: Are You There, DBA? It’s Me, The App Developer
## Abstract:
### Are you a frustrated DBA trying to improve performance on an application you didn’t write? Or perhaps you’re an application developer struggling to understand why your queries run slowly on someone else’s database? This talk will cover practical techniques to help developers and DBAs work together efficiently to troubleshoot poorly performing applications. 

Beginner/Intermediate software developers and DBAs will learn: when you need the actual query execution plan (and how to get it), why queries executed from SSMS perform differently than they do in the application, and how you can improve an application to make database troubleshooting easier. When the DBA and Developer join forces, there’s no problem they can’t solve!
