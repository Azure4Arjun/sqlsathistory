## Speaker: Rob Sullivan
## Title: SQL Server in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### With Microsoft going "All in" on the cloud and marketing teams being relentless in their promotion, it seems like the cloud isn't going to just be a fad. What does cloud even mean and why should people in the trenches like us care? We will answer those questions and more as we leave the confines of locahost and look at various cloud implementations including Microsofts own cloud service : SQL Azure.
