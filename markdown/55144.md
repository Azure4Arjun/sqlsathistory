## Abstract:
### Everyone has heard phrases like "Data is the new oil" or  "Data Analytics will shape business", and maybe you are also wondering what this R thing is about and if it's worth the effort to learn something new. This session is going to explain what R is and how it can help to refine your data and to better understand your business. Meaning, it provides ideas where R can be used in helping to answer some data related questions.

An explanation is given why R will be a great addition to the SQL Server arsenal and how R can be used with Azure Machine Learning. This session is not about coding or statistics, but about introducing a great new companion.
