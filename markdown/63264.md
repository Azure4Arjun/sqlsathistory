## Title: Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure Drone
## Abstract:
### Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure-Controlled Drone

Using SQL Server 2017, we will control a drone via NodeJS.  With the help of Python and ML we will then make the drone fly in the "Safe Zone". 

Join me in a presentation on how to create your Azure environment for data and analytics using the first ever drone controlled by SQL Server 2017. 

- creating a template to make proofs of concept possible
- real world situations and lessons learned in Azure
- consumption of that data through Power BI

This presentation will include creation of a hybrid solution for operational analytics both on-prem and cloud using Azure SQL Database in-memory and temporal tables to create the ultimate data and analytics experience.
