## Title: WTF with SQL
## Abstract:
### SQL is based on the relational  algebra, right? Relational algebra is based on set theory, right? So we would expect SQL to  kind-of respect common sense from set theory. Like A union A has the same number of elements as A. Well, this is not always the case with SQL.

Come and have fun when we explore scenarios of simple SQL statements, where I guarantee you moments of inner WTF.
