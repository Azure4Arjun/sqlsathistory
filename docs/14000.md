## Title: Win or lose: predicting customer response using Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### How can we use data to predict the future? In this session we'll explore dichotomous outcome prediction models using Azure Machine Learning. We'll use Azure Machine Learning to format and cleanse data with native modules and R, train learning algorithms, optimize parameters, and compare different models. Along the way we'll cover some of the key differences in feature selection and how to interpret the results.
