## Title: Definitive Proof that Pluto is Indeed a Planet
## Abstract:
### Ever the one left out, Pluto's status as a key member of the solar system has been under scrutiny in recent years and the debate rages on.

In the age of AI, surely it's an easy problem to solve with computering. I'm sure Microsoft has a crack team of hackstars working on it right now. What toolset do you think they would use to do something like that? Probably some fancy cloud bricks or something.

Anyway, I'm sure this is possible. It has to be, we'd just need to learn about:

- A distributed analytics platfrom able to work with tons of raw planetary data
- An AI platform that is performant and allows a team of developers to collaborate and improve the product
- The ability to call the model billions and billions and billions and billions errr

I don't think this will take much longer than 75 mins. Might as well get to it.

(Psst: You're going to learn all about scalable data processing and web scale analytics using Azure Databricks, MLFlow, and Azure ML)
