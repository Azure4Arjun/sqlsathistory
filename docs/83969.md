## Title: The hidden power of Power BI – now with Power BI Embedded
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a very powerful tool. But behind the shiny UI, Power BI REST API gives you even more features to create better solutions! In this session we will explore what you can do using Power BI REST API and what you can’t (at least not yet!). I will demonstrate how your program can authenticate itself (both in interactive and non-interactive way), how it can add new rows to a dataset or refresh it programmatically, how to share one dataset between multiple reports and how you can embed Power BI dashboards, reports, and tiles directly into your application.
