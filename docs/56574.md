## Title: Managing Availability Groups with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Always On Availability Groups are all the craze. When you have a need to failover or modify a configuration there are some things that you can only do with PowerShell. Aside from these items, PowerShell can completely manage an AG. Join me for a demo filled session where we will create an Always On Availability Group from scratch to management with PowerShell, including the Windows Server Failover Cluster. From changing parameters to failover, we will have a blast using PowerShell with ease of use to make your life better. Letâ€™s work smarter and not harder when managing this great feature of SQL Server.
