## Title: Counting is easy, Measuring is hard: insights using Data Visualisation
## Abstract:
### "Don’t worry about people stealing an idea. If it’s original, you will have to ram it down their throats.” Howard Aiken, Founder of Harvard’s Computing Science Program. Counting is easy, measuring is hard! KPIs, dashboards, and basic data analytics often make us feel like we understand what’s going on. Data is moving so fast these days, and people understand it best through data visualisation. However, Data Visualisation can lead and mislead, and in this session we will look at theory and practice based on dataviz gurus such as Stephen Few and Edward Tufte, and scientists such as Cleveland and Ben Schneiderman. If you don't know who they are - even more reason for you to join us and learn what the gurus have to say about dataviz!  If your data is visualised wrong, your data-based decisions are based on wrong insights. In this session, we will look at understanding the data visualisation by exploring the Power BI components and tools available in the cloud.
