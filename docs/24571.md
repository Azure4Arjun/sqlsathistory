## Title: SQL Server 2014 Cardinality Estimator changes  
## Abstract:
### This session covers the changes made to Cardinality Estimations and Calculations in SQL Server 2014.
SQL Server 2014 introduces the first major redesign of the SQL Server Query Optimizer cardinality estimation process since version 7.0. The goal for the redesign was to improve accuracy, consistency and supportability of key areas within the cardinality estimation process, ultimately affecting average query execution plan quality and associated workload performance. 
Topics Covered in this session
How to enable and disable the new cardinality estimator behavior?
What changed in new cardinality estimations?
How to troubleshoot plan-quality regressions if and when they occur?
Note : Presentation based on recent white paper released from Microsoft.
