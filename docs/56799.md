## Title: Getting Started with SQL Server Replication
## Abstract:
### SQL Server replication is an excellent way to keep a subset of data synced with another database for reporting, audit, or recovery purposes.  In this session we will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of transactional and snapshot replication so you can utilize it as a valuable tool in your toolkit.  We will also examine some ways to make replication perform better as well. This session is targeted towards database administrators who have little to no experience with replication and developers looking for different ways to duplicate data for reporting or data consumption.
