## Title: SQL Server  Machine Learning Services in Production
## Abstract:
### Writing code which uses SQL Server Machine Learning Services is easy enough, but that is just the beginning of the story.  In this talk, we will cover the rest of the R development story for database administrators.  We will look at the methods available to install and maintain R packages, learn good practices for deploying and maintaining custom SQL Server Machine Learning Services code, and learn where to find critical information when things break.  These battle-tested tips will make it easier for you to integrate R and SQL Server Machine Learning Services in your existing deployment processes and get the most out of this feature.
