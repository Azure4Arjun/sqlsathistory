## Title: Data Science and Machine Learning with Azure - Experiences from the field
## Abstract:
### Data Science is becoming an increasingly accessible discipline, and Microsoft Azure has several powerful, intuitive tools for doing everything from Big Data processing to Machine Learning. While the democratization of advanced analytical techniques is undeniably one of the biggest leaps within Business Intelligence in recent times, it calls for us as analysts to add a few new tools to our belts and expand our skillsets into the uncharted territories of advanced mathematics and statistics.

This sounds scary and initimidating, but it really isn't. We're going to prove this by sharing experiences, useful takeaways and practical guidelines we've established from working with Machine Learning and Data Science in Capgemini for clients within healthcare, public transport and retail, as well as in our spare time. We talk about Azure ML, Spark, R and Python, and most importantly; we cover the Data Science workflow itself and how to actually answer questions with data and analytical models.
