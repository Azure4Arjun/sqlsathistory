## Speaker: Andrew Loree
## Title: SQL Server 2017 (Linux and Beyond)
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has leveled the RDBMS playing field, with SQL Server vNext  (aka SQL Server 2017), allowing you to deploy and run SQL Server on a variety of operating systems and container solutions.

In this session, we will look at the background of SQL Serverâ€™s move to non-Windows platforms, cover how to install using package deployment on Linux and image-containers with Docker.  Focus will cover administration and tools that you can leverage while running SQL Server on non-Windows platforms, including migration and current feature function limitations.
