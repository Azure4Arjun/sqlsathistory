## Title: Optimizing SQL Server Performance in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll explore some of the things you should be looking at within your virtual environment to ensure that you are getting the best possible performance out of it. 

We will discuss how to look for CPU performance issues at the host level. We will also be looking at the Memory Balloon drivers and what they actually do, as well as how you should be configuring them and why.  

We will then talk about some of the memory sharing technologies which are built into vSphere and Hyper-V and how they relate to SQL Server, and weâ€™ll finish up the session with some storage configuration options.
