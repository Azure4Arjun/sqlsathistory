## Title: Introduction to Containers
## Abstract:
### Containers have been around for a while now but are becoming increasingly popular and with Microsoft’s release of Windows Server 2016, Docker is now their effective container standard. In this demo heavy session, we will run through what containers are, how to get started with Docker and “spinning up” SQL Server environments with minimal fuss. Along the way we will run through some of the issues you may encounter and learn from my mistakes. 

By the end of the session you will have the know how to go away and create your own bespoke SQL Server development and testing environments.
