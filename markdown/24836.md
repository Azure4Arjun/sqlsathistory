## Title: Pig\Hive - All That's New is Old Again
## Abstract:
### Pig and Hive sound strange and exotic, but what are they?  As a SQL Server DBA you'll find these two technologies to be quite familiar and easy to learn. Why?  Because both were created for you. If you are a SQL Server DBA and you have to manage data in Hadoop, Pig and Hive may be your first tools of choice. This session will demystify both with clear examples and demos.
