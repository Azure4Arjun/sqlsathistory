## Title: Deploying Power BI:  A Blueprint for implementation success
## Abstract:
### As companies become more familiar with Power BI, some have begun experimenting with it on production settings.  Some, though, are confused as to how to properly deploy this powerful tool:   Who should own Power BI as a solution within the organization?  Who is responsible for what?  Is this tool for the business or for I.T.?   Can we look at it as a reporting tool or is it that plus something else?
 
This session will present a practical guide for implementing Power BI at your organization to maximize success and adoption.   It will present technical and non-technical details to ensure your Power BI deployment is as successful as possible.
