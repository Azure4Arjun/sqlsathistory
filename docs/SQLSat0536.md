#### [Back to calendar](#nr-536)
Event Date: 27-08-2016 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Unicorn safari - alleviating consolidation pains with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Database consolidation was once described to me as a bit of a mix between the holy grail and a unicorn. Not that difficult in theory, but have a way of getting very messy in practice. SQL Server 2016 brings several new features to simplify the whole process, and hopefully provide the DBA and the people footing the license bill some sorely needed respite.
This presentation will outline the classic issues with consolidation of small and medium-sized databases and explore what new pain relief SQL Server 2016 brings to the table.
At the end of this session you will have a good understanding of the challenges and solutions available in SQL Server for solving consolidation workloads.

# Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed

Event Date: 27-08-2016 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Arne Bartels
## Title: Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed
## Abstract:
### In the Wind turbine industry it is often desirable to know where a wind turbine casts its shadow as it can case annoyance to neighbours.
This session is supposed to be a more entertaining then practical exercise to combine scarsely used data types in unusual fashion, combined with a bit of astronomy and math, to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbine purely by using SQL2016 Management Studio. 

The calculation of the daily path of a shadow can be seen as a rather complex three-dimensional problem. By turning around the perspective and 'painting' the picture of turbines in the sky this can be decribed as a much simpler two-dimensional problem on a sphere. For this the geography data type will be used and in turn the richness of its functionality demonstrated. Even a sufficient visualisaton is included in SSMS 2016.  Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handeled in SQL and no complex math is needed.

# GIving Permissions through Stored Procedures
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-536)
Event Date: 27-08-2016 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: GIving Permissions through Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### You probably know that with a stored procedure you can permit users to access or update data even if they have no direct permissions on the table. But you may have noticed that this does not work when the SP uses dynamic SQL. 

In this session you will learn why it is so and techniques how you can use to overcome this. You will also learn that the same techniques can be to permit users to perform specific actions they need to do without granting them general high-level permissions on database or server level by packaging these actions into a stored procedure. You will also learn why should should be careful with setting a database TRUSTWORTHY.

The session should be of interest both to DBAs and application developers that need to consider advanced permissions in their stored procedures.

Event Date: 27-08-2016 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Tools and Tips: From Accidental to Efficient Data Warehouse Developer
## Abstract:
### You have probably heard about the Accidental DBA, but what about the Accidental Data Warehouse developer? We stumbled into the world of data warehousing, learned dimensional modeling and work with T-SQL and SSIS daily. We are masters of googling solutions to our problems and make sure our ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users... but we rarely deliver data as fast as we want.

You might not be able to rewrite your entire Data Warehouse or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient Data Warehouse developer.

In this session I will show you some of what I have learned and discovered that has made me exclaim "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" - including SSMS features, tools for query analysis and tuning, free tools and scripts, Biml for SSIS and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.

## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.

Event Date: 27-08-2016 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Bjorn D. Jensen
## Title: Why (data) quality matters
## Abstract:
### Poor data quality has a cost. 
Examples of data quality challenges and their impact.
Having correct data is very important to make correct decisions. 
Data quality goes hand in hand with proper data modelling.
Knowledge about use cases and workload is important input to your data modelling. 
Different kinds of compression can be relevant depending on your usage scenario.
Storing data economically also means that data should be easy to use. 
Having focus on deadlines whithout having (data) quality in mind will hit you hard at an later point in time.

Delivering good query performance and reports in time is important to business users,
but how to measure it from their perspective?

And obviously the features you provide should work. 
This is where you benefit from unit testing. (Demo of unit testing with SSDT.)

## Speaker: Markus Winand
## Title: Indexes: The neglected performance all-rounder
## Abstract:
### Proper indexing is a very time and cost-effective way to improve SQL performance. Yet it is hardly known how to get it right and how different ways to phrase a query affects indexing and performance. In this session I’ll explain why this knowledge is sparse and what developers can do about it. Finally we will go through the most important indexing mistakes by example and discuss them during a short live quiz with the audience.
