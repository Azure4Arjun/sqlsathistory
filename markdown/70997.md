## Title: Harnessing D3.js to visualize geographical data
## Abstract:
### Visualizing data on maps; simple, right? Depending on your requirements visualizing data on a map may not be as straightforward as you’d imagine. There are a lot of great mapping libraries available that can accommodate most scenarios out of the box. But what happens when you want something that isn’t so out of the box? You customize it. In this presentation, we will create a vector map of the United States using a very popular JavaScript library D3.js and bring data to the map.
