## Title: Persisting and Tracking Workflows Using SqlServer
## Abstract:
### SqlServer plays an important role for out-of-the-box tracking and persisting workflows. Without persistence, workflows could not handle processes that run over long periods of time. Without tracking information about a workflow as it runs, they can sometimes become black boxes while they run. This session will focus on getting DBA's up to speed with what is happening under the hood and what is required to wire up these services within SQLServer.
