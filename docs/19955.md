## Title: Change Tracking:  A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control
## Abstract:
### Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture.  Change Tracking is now the red-headed step child, but in most cases may be a better solution for data ETL movement from a SQL Server OLTP database to a data warehouse database.  This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos.  It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos.  Most of presentation is demos.
