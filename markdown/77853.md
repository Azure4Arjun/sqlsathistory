## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: To Azure and Beyond:  Create an Azure VM with SSRS server and deploy Mobile and Paginated reports
## Abstract:
### SSRS Report Server is no long ‘earthbound’; it can live among the ‘stars’ up in Azure!
When we think of Azure, our happy home in the Cloud, we may not think Reporting Services; after all, we have Power BI.  However, even with Power BI, there is still a strong need (desire) for paginated reports in today’s businesses.  So how can we have the best of both worlds; have the data and servers in Azure and still create SSRS reports for the end users?  The answer: create a report server in Azure.  With that, you can host both Paginated (old style) and Mobile Reports.  Steve will deploy both to the newly created VM.
Steve will take you step by step to Build a VM in Azure,  Create a Report Server on the VM, and  Configure the various components; you will be able to see how everything works together.  Come join Steve for this demo heavy session as he walks you through the entire process, including report deployment. Lastly, compare Paginated  Mobile rpts to similar PowerBI. To Azure and Beyond!
