## Title: Microsoft Azure : Elastic Cloud Compute and Storage for Big Data Processing
## Abstract:
### Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) appliances have gained increasing popularity for processing both structured, unstructured and semi structured big data. Cloud platforms for big data as a service are gaining momentum in recent years because of the convenience they provide mainly due to fast and independent scaling of storage and compute resources as well as a pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this session Orion will explain the fundamentals behind MPP big data processing tools, with a focus on Azure SQL Data Warehouse and provide a practical demonstration of the capabilities of the tool.
