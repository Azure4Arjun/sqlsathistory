## Title: SQL Server Data Collector From Every Angle (IT)
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Data Collector has been around since SQL Server 2008 but a surprisingly high number of DBAs are not using it. Itâ€™s free, it ships with the product and it gives great insight into the performance metrics that really matter when monitoring your servers. In this session you will learn how the SQL Server Data Collector works, how to set it up according to the best practices and how to extend it and customize it to fit your needs.
