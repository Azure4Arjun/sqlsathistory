## Title: Why and how to Implement PowerShell DSC for SQL Server - Part 2
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at the dedicated SQL specifics that we will be looking to apply using PowerShell DSC and in this session we will have standup a SQL Server using DSC and with an existing SQL Server we will cover with a live demo the changing of some SQL Settings in the Configuration and how this makes life easier for Management of SQL Servers at scale - No more need for manually changing Service Account passwords on mulitple SQL Servers when we can apply it via a configuration to many servers at once.
