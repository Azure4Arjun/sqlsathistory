## Title: Giving Feedback: How to Effectively Communicate to your Employees
## Abstract:
### As a manager or team leader giving effective feedback is vital to the success of projects. Managers often ascend the hierarchy due to their technical skill set but rarely learn ways to successfully communicate with their team. In this session, we will discuss soft skills and best practices to give feedback. We’ll learn the essentials for an interaction and how to prepare for tough conversations. Using sample coaching conversations, we’ll run through examples to help you prepare for your next tough dialog. Whether it is a simple coaching sit down, or performance improvement related, and even disciplinary actions, learn how to handle confrontation tactfully.
