## Title: Mentoring  Professional Development Plans
## Abstract:
### This will be a very interactive session as we discuss professional development plans including why you should write it down, what to do when your manager doesn't care, finding time and funding to implement your plan, and what to do when your plan doesn't quite work out. We'll also discuss finding a mentor and the value that a mentor can add to your career.
