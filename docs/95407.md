## Title: Data Science with SQL Server Machine Learning Service: Predictive Experiment
## Abstract:
### Making data available for data science was considered as very expensive and it was rare to see data scientist works directly with a database for creating experiments. Main reason could be, widely-used languages for data science were not available within DBMSs and DBMSs were not rich enough for experiments.

Good news is, SQL Server Machine Learning Service is now equipped for data science. Let’s have a look on it and see how we can work on training experiments and predictive experiments. Let me show you;
•	What is Data Science and its processes?
•	What is SQL Server Machine Learning Service?
•	Configuring SQL Server for data science
•	Make a training experiment and predictive experiment using Python within SQL Server
•	Consumed a trained model using TSQL

Join with me and see how useful this with both operational and business intelligence areas.
