## Title: Becoming Moused - How you can apply Disney Leadership to your Data Teams

Disney is a world class leader in Customer Experience. In this session we will explore how Disney's approach can help us build better platforms! Learn how to define your customers and their needs, differentiate your service, envision the future, and influence change. Come be Moused - Mickey Ears Optional!
