## Title: Hands on Data Science Tutorial
## Abstract:
### Our tutorial is for anyone new to data science or is interested in taking the first steps. We start by highlighting how data science and artificial intelligence can help achieve business goals. We go into reviewing the data science process and steps involved. This is followed by a live hands-on workshop where we build a simple linear regression model to make predictions and then we evaluate the results.
