## Title: Managing Table Partitions at the Extremes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s table partitioning gets interesting at the extremes: namely the initial (often “before”) partition, as well as the last (often “future”) partition. In this session you’ll learn how to manage partitioned tables at these extremes based on choices concerning the partition key, files and filegroups, archiving, and adding future partitions.
