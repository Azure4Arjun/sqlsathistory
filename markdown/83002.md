## Title: Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB SQL API
## Abstract:
### Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure Cosmos DB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 
In this session, you will learn how to: create a Cosmos DB instance in Azure; work with JSON documents; create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax; create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript; manage security; modify indexes; stream twitter data into a collection; extract data using SSIS C# script tasks into SQL Server; visualize data using PowerBI; and finally compare performance and feature differences between SQL Server 2017 and Azure Cosmos DB when working with JSON data.
