## Speaker: Mark Bosley
## Title: Stupid SQL and the Programmers that Write it
## Abstract:
### You work with smart people, but there you are in a code review of a co-worker's SQL ready to be rushed into production and it is so elaborately stupid that you don't know where to start. How did we get here? Why is the level of SQL literacy so low?
There are two goals in the session. First, we will look at lot's of stupid SQL. Second, we will talk about how to encourage co-workers to write better SQL.
Looking at stupid SQL can help even experienced programmers as we examine why something is wrong. Along the way, we note where SQL Server itself is stupid (e.g. the IsNumeric function) 
We will also look at some places where some subtleties of SQL can trip even an experienced Pro.
