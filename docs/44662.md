## Title: How to use R in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### R represents the primary analysis language for the majority of data scientists and statisticians. SQL Server 2016 will allow you to run R scripts. In this session we will demonstrate how to run R analytics in the database so any user can explore the data, build predictive models and embed the R code into Transact-SQL stored procedures.
