## Title: Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.
 
We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.
