## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals  Architecture
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-	...and much more.

## Title: As a DBA, Where do I start?
## Abstract:
### Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on the responsibility of one or are starting at a new role as a DBA, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority build. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also have a look at some of the available tools and scripts to help us see where our environments rate with the "itties" of Database Administration.

## Title: You Can Improve Your Own SQL Code
## Abstract:
### In this talk, Mike will show us some of the tools that come with SQL Server and how they can be used to analyze the performance of our database code. We will take a quick walk through indexing, best practices, some quick tips and then have a more in depth look at Execution Plans, IO Statistics and Profiler. Plus as a DBA, Mike can give a few pointers in working with your organization's own "Dr. No" along the way. Rough Agenda: • Review of Best Practices • Indexing/Table Structure High Level Overview • Will your queries use the index? • Query Plans don’t have to be scary • IO Statistics, Profiler • Put Them Together (Use the tools before you say, "Done!" • Interaction with the DBA (How to be a partner in performance with the DB

## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage for the DBA
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Is Virtualization is a good choice for SQL Server?
## Abstract:
### We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.

# SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World

Event Date: 06-03-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 7
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.

## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: SSIS, You, and ETL Architecture
## Abstract:
### BOS30-200: SSIS, You , and Better ETLDid you already learned SSIS, and now want to get serious about ETL? Did you become an SSIS developer by accident, but wonder what makes a good ETL solution? Is your current SSIS solution falling apart and you need to revamp it? The Complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poor crafted solution would inevitable lead to maintenance nightmares, or worse yet to the failure of the whole project. In this session we will try to bridge SSIS and a ETL architecture based on good practices while looking to some lessons learned from real world implementations.

## Title: Tips For The Lazy But Driven DBA
## Abstract:
### Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I’ve developed a toolbox of scripts and arsenal of processes that I rely upon to give insight into disk space, file growth, backup status, Agent job outcomes, and login management.  Some of these I’ve shared on various websites and blogs; others see the light of day for the first time in this session.  Attendees leave the session with processes and code they can begin to use immediately.
