## Speaker: Simon Kingaby
## Title: Implementing an SSIS Framework and enforcing SSIS Patterns (with Biml).
## Abstract:
### Let's use Biml to automate the implementation of a standard, pattern-based SSIS Framework.  I.e.  Logging, error handling, etc.  Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is great at automating the creation of SSIS packages.  With Biml we can generate a template package that implements a standard SSIS framework.  In this fast-paced session, we will create the tables and load some metadata, write the Biml to implement logging and error handling, and generate some packages that implement our standard framework.  In this session, you don't need to know Biml, but some familiarity with XML, TSQL or C# will help.  By the end of this session, you will know how to use Biml to automatically generate packages that implement a simple SSIS Framework with Audit Logging and Error Handling.
