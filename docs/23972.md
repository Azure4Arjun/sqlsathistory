## Title: Private Clouds with SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### The recent growth of cloud computing has companies evaluating when  how, not if, they will move their data offsite.

The goal of this session is to provide you a blueprint to design  build your own SQL Server cloud, where you can control the server availability  performance reliability, yet still take advantage of the resource elasticity and hardware flexibility of the cloud. In this session, I will demonstrate how to use features like always on, resource governor, policy based management  PowerShell scripts to automate your servers behavior to achieve the benefits of the cloud without the risks
