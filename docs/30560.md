## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Cross Tabs  Pivots: Converting Rows into Columns
## Abstract:
### Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL.   SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden demonstrates and explains simple methods for converting gobs of “vertical data” into horizontal numeric and textual data by date or other key using Cross Tabs and Pivots.  This session includes the “Black Arts” method of “Pre-Aggregation” for incredibly high performance and how to dynamically and automatically produce reports based on a date.  The methods learned in this session can be used to provide “dynamically pivoted” result sets to SSRS, Crystal Reports, and other reporting software.
