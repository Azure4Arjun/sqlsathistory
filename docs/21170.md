## Title: Simple things you can do to make  the Query Optimizer more efficient!
## Abstract:
### On occasion as DBAs we have need to disable the foreign keys and constraints on one or more tables. Guess what, SQL Server no longer trusts those constraints when you re-enable them. What does that mean? In this discussion, weâ€™ll talk about what the impact is to your queries when you have non-trusted constraints, how to find the non-trusted constraints, and how to soothe SQL Servers mistrusting heart so that it will trust your constraints again! How about your foreign keys? Are you using implicit conversions? Are your stats 'stale'? All of these things effect how the query optimizer works and can negatively affect you query performance.
