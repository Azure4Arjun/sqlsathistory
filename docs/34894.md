## Title: Introduction to ElasticSearch
## Abstract:
### ElasticSearch is based on a Lucene core and is an easily and highly scalable search engine. We'll start with an introduction and overview of what ElasticSearch is and how it works. We'll cover the ElasticSearch query language, it's architecture and scalability model. We'll talk about some of the different roles that ElasticSearch can play in a Big Data architecture. We'll wrap up by starting a couple of ElasticSearch nodes and showing how easy it is to startup, cluster, and run queries against ElasticSearch.
