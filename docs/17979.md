## Title: Extend your Knowledge with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### With 2012 Extended Events became much easier to use and is a great way to find out more of what is going on in the database.  This 
presentation will show how you can use Extended Events to find out about items like Deadlocks and Query Performance.  We will create a 
new Event and I will show you how you can use the data collected to report commonly monitored statistics.
