Azure Data Factory. This is not SSIS in Azure. But it’s a start for our control flows. Let’s update our terminology and understand how to invoke our Azure data services with this new controller/conductor who wants to understand our structured datasets. Learn to create the perfect dependency driven pipeline with Azure Data Factory and allow your data to flow. What’s an activity and how do we work with time slices? Is a pipeline a pipeline? Who is this JSon person? All the answers to these questions and more in this introduction to working with Azure Data Factory. Plus, insights from a real-world case study where ADF has been used in production for a big data business intelligence solution handling log files for 1.5 billion users.
