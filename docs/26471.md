Event Date: 04-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Common TSQL Mistakes
## Abstract:
### We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over FIFTY times now and it is always very highly rated!
