## Title: Enriching Applications with SSAS Data Mining
## Abstract:
### Data mining as a technology is designed to analyze large volumes of data looking for patterns that accurately predict behavior. These patterns can then be used to derive knowledge about data, and in turn this knowledge can be used to enhance application designs and the user experience. In this presentation, you will be introduced to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 Data Mining and demonstrations on how to develop data mining models that can be embedded into your applications. Demonstrations are based on SQL Server 2008 R2 Data Mining. This presentation is a must for any developer looking to embed “Artificial Intelligence” into their solution design to take their applications to the next level.
