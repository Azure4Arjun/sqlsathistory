## Title: Creating ETL/ELT Data Flows for the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### One major challenge in the age of "Big Data" is keeping up with the volume and velocity of data with respect to moving it to the Data Warehouse. In this session, attendees will learn about Microsoft's answer to this problem; Azure Data Factory (ADF), and specifically, Mapping Data Flows. ADF Mapping Data Flows enables data engineers to construct, execute, and monitor data pipelines, based on the highly scalable Azure Databricks Spark Engine, with little to no code.

This session will be very demo-heavy, with demonstrations of effective patterns and practices that have been deployed by some of Microsoft's largest customers throughout the world.
