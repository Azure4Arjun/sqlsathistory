## Title: Using Excel Web Services to Create Dashboards in SharePoint
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll do a deep dive into Excel Web Services, a feature of SharePoint, that allows us to use Excel to create custom dashboards. Dashboards are pages served up by SharePoint and we'll look at how to create these pages, add Excel Web Services web parts to these pages, and arrange these web parts and "connect" these parts to communicate with each other, to create interactive, updating dashboards for our users.
