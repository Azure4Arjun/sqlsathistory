### AWS offers a broad range of databases purpose-built for your specific application use cases. It offers managed Relational, Non-Relational, Data Warehouse, In-Memory Data Store, and Graph Databases. AWS fully managed database services include relational databases for transactional applications, non-relational databases for internet-scale applications, a data warehouse for analytics, an in-memory data store for caching and real-time workloads, and a graph database for building applications with highly connected data. To migrate their existing databases to AWS, the AWS Database Migration Service makes it easy and cost effective to do so. The specific session will cover all the different databases products offered by AWS and the features and the key benefits and also the key clients who all use the products and catering to their specific needs.
