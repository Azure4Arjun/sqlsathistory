## Title: Data Modeling for Integration of RDBMS with NOSQL
## Abstract:
### Join us to explore how emerging data modeling methods and model notations help us define, and easily communicate, robust integration points between NOSQL data stores and emerging RDBMS 'Lean Data Warehouse' models that would otherwise be challenging to map across due to radical differences in normalization.   Did you buy the pitch about how 'BigData and RDBMS  Data Warehouses can remain in isolation'.      Me neither!      You will leave this sessions not only free from some rigid E/R modeling assumptions and diagramming standards, but also armed with an introduction to a practical method of logical data modeling in the new world of polyglot data storage.
