## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Hadoop for the Business Intelligence Professional
## Abstract:
### Microsoft have teamed with HortonWorks to provide their own distribution of Hadoop running on both Windows Server as well as Azure.  This shows a real intention on looking to Big Data. Being able to store huge amounts of data is no good if you do not have the tools to get the information back out.  Luckily Microsoft have those tools in PV and PP. This session will be broken into 2.  Allan will set the scene with Hadoop and give us a tour of what is on offer and quickly how to look at the data.  Jen will then follow this up and really drive some business benefits from the data stored in Hadoop.
