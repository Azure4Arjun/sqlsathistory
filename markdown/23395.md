## Title: First Day DBA - Installation to Fascination withou
## Abstract:
### 
In this session we will step through the very basics of SQL Server for the new DBA. Since we can not delve into the SQL Server without a SQL Server, we will install one from scratch. Next we will add a database, write a couple of simple queries and export and import some data. All of this will be in preparation for our final look at running a report using data that we just loaded. At the end you will be familiar with many of the tools and techniques that DBAs use every day.
