## Title: The databases in SSDT - a work with project and best practices
## Abstract:
### A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as a number of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain in the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.
