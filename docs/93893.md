## Title: SSRS - Thinking Outside the Report
## Abstract:
### Most of us use SSRS to create reports, maybe send out notifications or provide data outputs for users to consume, but what if you needed to give your user the ability to run a job on demand, or modify data or execute a SSIS package? Can SSRS do that?  Yes it and I will show you how.
