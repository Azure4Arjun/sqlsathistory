## Title: Plan, Design and Implement a HADR Solution - a Journey
## Abstract:
### Have you ever struggled to get a HA and DR solution for a single instance with more than 50 applications, 100 databases and 4 TB of data? 
Over the years, HA and DR has been a challenge with SQL Server. As the product evolved so did the options simplified for achieving a feasible HADR solution.
In this session I will walk you through various projects I have worked on in past 8 years. 
I will start with the basic DR solution built using Log shipping, an alternate to AGs in SQL 2008 using Powershell/.NET and SAN Replication and the latest 4 node, two site cluster built with Availability Groups.
