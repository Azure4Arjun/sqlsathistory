## Title: PERNIXDATA: 'Leveraging In-Memory Computing Underneath Virtual SQ
## Abstract:
### In-memory computing is gaining widespread acceptance as a way to speed database performance by moving hot data into main memory. But, In-memory solutions tend to be limited in functionality, lack scalability, are cumbersome to deploy and configure, and are extremely expensive. 

PernixData FVP solves these challenges by turning in-memory computing into an infrastructure layer solution that benefits all virtualized applications. SQL Server plays exceptionally well with FVP. Come learn more about this exciting technology today!
