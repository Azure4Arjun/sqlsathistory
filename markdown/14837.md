## Title: A New Frontier of Government  Open Data: What it Means to You  Microsoft BI Tools
## Abstract:
### I am following up to a 2011 SQL Saturday presentation that I gave on this same topic.  Open Data is freely available for everyone to use and republish as they wish without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.  The United States Government has a dedicated open data portal at Data.gov, and there are now hundreds if not thousands of open data portals from countries, provinces, counties, companies, and cities.  Now that there is open data available for you to reach out and grab, what comes next?  I'll review the maturation process of the open data movement, some examples of what's been done with it by myself and others, and how Microsoft BI tools are prime for mashing it up to make it usable and understandable.  Now that open data is widely available, the benefits it has to offer governments, companies, academia, and individual citizens will continue to expand exponentially.  We now have the information, so let's get going with the integration!
