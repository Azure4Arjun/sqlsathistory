## Title: Think Outside the Group! Take MDX to the next leve
## Abstract:
### Reporting Services is a powerful tool that can make designing reports a snap...most of the time. But every once in a while you have to format a report very specifically, and that starts with your data query.  In this session, we'll think outside the group! Learn about how to use named sets, dummy members, and other MDX tricks to craft your queries in a way that allows you to conquer the trickiest report layouts.
