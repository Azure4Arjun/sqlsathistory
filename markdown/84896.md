## Title: Power BI Premium Use Cases
## Abstract:
### We will walk through all the various Power BI (PBI) deployments and data sourcing methods.  I will discuss actual use cases so you will know when each solution is appropriate.  Deployment topics to be covered include a PBI loaded model, PBI direct connect, and PBI live connect.  On-premises data sourcing topics include SQL databases, Oracle databases, Analysis Services Tabular, and Excel files.  Cloud data sourcing topics include Azure Data Lake, Azure Analysis Services, and Snowflake on Azure.  There will be a few demos regarding the developer approaches for the actual use cases.  I will start the session by introducing the basics of Power BI Premium, and work our way into complexities necessary to support an enterprise.
