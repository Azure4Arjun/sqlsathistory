## Speaker: Martin Schoombee
## Title: How "quirky" is your update?
## Abstract:
### Running totals are a lot easier with the SQL Server 2012 T-SQL syntax, but making it perform over large data sets still remain a challenge. This demo-heavy session will explore the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to calculating running totals. 

Our main focus however, will be a method coined by Jeff Moden as the "quirky update". This method produces lightning-fast results when calculating running totals, and sometimes the only option if you're dealing with large volumes and high performance requirements.
