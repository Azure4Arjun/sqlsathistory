## Title: Azure SQL Database Vs. Amazon RDS
## Abstract:
### They are the largest hosting companies in the world, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, both have our beloved SQL Server running as a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service). 

The term DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) is a brand new concept that brings the self-managing cloud process to our reality, now administrative tasks and process such as backup, high availability and disaster recovery solutions will be handed to the hosting company.

Flexibility, scalability on-demand, and rapid provisioning are the hottest points to move towards to the PaaS delivery.
Ready to change the mindset of your company and concern only with the business value, join with me on this session and open your mind to the new reality.
