## Title: Much Ado About Hadoop
## Abstract:
### By now you've probably heard the words "Big Data" and "Hadoop", but you're not sure what they mean, much less how to get started. Maybe you're struggling with storing a lot of data, rapidly processing a huge volume of data, or maybe you're just curious. There are a bewildering array of options and use cases within the Hadoop ecosystem. Every day I help customers understand their data problems, understand where Hadoop fits into their environment, and determine how they can use Hadoop to solve their problem. This session provides an introduction to what Hadoop is, when it's appropriate to use Hadoop, and guidance on how to get started.
