## Title: Master your tools: SSMS
## Abstract:
### SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) is probably the most used application for working with SQL Server. Many of us use it on a daily basis. SSMS is a complex application and it has many 'hidden' features that some of us are not aware of. Yet using them will allow us to be achieve more and be more efficient. During the session I will demonstrate many such 'hidden' features that could be very useful.
