## Title: Waiter, There's a Fly In My Data 
## Abstract:
### Dealing with bad data is a painful and expensive experience.  In this session we will jump into SQL Server 2012 for a hands-on demonstration of cleansing and correcting data with  SQL Server Data Quality Services (DQS) and Integrations Services (SSIS). We will dive into DQS knowledge-driven approach, reusability, cleansing and matching, and explore the collaboration opportunities between data stewards and IT professionals.  You will demonstrate how to create a knowledge base, define domains and rules to clean data, enrich data by using third-party data providers, and use the new SSIS DQS cleansing component.
