## Title: Hybrid Cloud and On-Premise Environment for Model Development and Deployment
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce the model development and deployment capabilities that are integrated between SQL Server and the Microsoft Cloud Platform. We will demonstrate the model development process using Microsoft R Server on the Cloud, discuss some of the key differences between open source R and Microsoft R Server, and finally deploy the finished model into an on-premise instance of SQL Server for scoring and operationalization. No prior background in data science or model development is necessary.
