## Title: Standardized SQL Installations – Script Review  Demo
## Abstract:
### This session is mostly demo-focused. I will cover prerequisites for scripts and show how to do multiple SQL Server installations using scripts and demonstrate how to Streamline SQL Server implementations. 

You’ll take-away script to install different versions of SQL Server on supported OS systems. This script allows anyone in IT to install SQL systems with best practices baked into it which ensure all SQL installation can be streamlined. 

You’ll see PowerShell scripts where a single line script can install any of these combinations:
• Windows 2008R2/2012/2012R2
• SQL 2014/2012/2008R2 (Enterprise/Standard/Developer editions)
• Implement best practices and configuration based on available resources for dedicated SQL Server environments
