# Power BI as a universal analytic tool 1/2
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#873---Bratislava-2019)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Michal Chmelár
## Title: Power BI as a universal analytic tool 1/2
## Abstract:
### In Power BI, you can also do other kinds of analyses than just business analytics. In this lecture you’ll see, how you can use Power BI together with cloud services for quick check of facts from freely available data sources, even if they aren’t published in a particularly suitable format. You will also see, how you can quickly analyze unstructured text (e.g. communication with customers). At the end we will take a look at PowerApps, using which you can not only quickly create a new business app in your web browser, but also integrate it in your Power BI reports, so that you can quickly react to results and take action from a single environment. Because Power BI is capable of doing much more than “just” business analyses.
