## Title: BigData -NoSQL - MongoDB
## Abstract:
### BigData is nowdays bottleneck in the current systems. SQL can't provide a good way to store and treat a huge amount of data.   NoSQL databases were designed to support BigData. MongoDB is one of the NoSQL databases, which is easy-scalable, productive and free for most of the cases.
This session is about MongoDB in general and in comparison with MS SQL Server vendor.
