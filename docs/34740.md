## Title: Primer on Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI (Business Intelligence) is a new and emerging self-service business intelligence and business analytics framework that brings together and enhances a few key Microsoft technologies. Fundamentally, Power BI is considered a premium Office option, because Microsoft licenses it that way. We will answer the following questions:

◾What makes Power BI different from the Microsoft Office I have known for years?

◾What are the major Power BI features in Excel 2013 and 2010?

◾What are the major features for Power BI for Office 365?

◾How can our team license Power BI?
