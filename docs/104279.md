## Title: Sponsored Session: Snowflake - The Modern Data Platform
## Abstract:
### Data is the new oil ! 
But just sitting on a patch of oil does not make one rich.  The oil needs to be drilled, extracted, refined and ultimately sold.
Same with data. Getting the right data in the hands of the right people in a timely manner seems to be more of a challenge than most organizations realize, and the reason for that is the limitations imposed by legacy on-premises and cloud v1.0 data warehouses.
Snowflake is a Modern Cloud Data Platform, rooted in the cloud, freeing you from those shackles and allowing you to use your data more efficiently, rather than spending all your time managing the underlying infrastructure and costs.
Come listen how Snowflake has enabled thousands of customers to make better, faster decisions, save money and discover new ways to use data! 
As a bonus, come learn how Snowflake enables customers to share relevant data in a modern, low-calorie way!
