## Speaker: Randolph West
## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning Starter Kit
## Abstract:
### Let me take you on a fast-paced journey through basic database internals, hardware and operating system setup, and how to configure SQL Server, to avoid hearing this most painful sentence for any DBA: "the database is slow".

I talk quickly, and cover a lot of ground, but don't let that scare you.
