## Title: SQL Server vs. Windows Server - how to configure Windows for better SQL Server performance
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is running in Windows Server Operating system, however, most of the OS Administrators treats SQL Server just like another basic application. On the session, I will show how steps taken before actual installation of SQL Server can impact performance. The session is a walk through on all of the layers starting on hardware, virtualization (if used), Operating System and finally SQL Server. After the session, you will have set of best practices that can be applied to your environment.
