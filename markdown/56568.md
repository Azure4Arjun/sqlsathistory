## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Date Dimension: One Script for All
## Abstract:
### All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most data warehouse designers use one that is provided by tools or create one in Excel. But what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all the calculations and formatting up front so that reports are easier to create. A sample script is provided; it creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse--and it takes only seconds to run!
