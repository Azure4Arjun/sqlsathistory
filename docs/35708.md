## Title: Strategies for SQL Server Index Analysis
## Abstract:
### Properly managing indexes for a database is a common usse in many environments. When reviewing an index, should it have a single or multiple columns? Should the table be a heap, a clustered index or clustered columnstore index? These considerations are often at the forefront when analyzing your indexes. In this session, we'll look at easy methods for identifying new indexes, we'll review patterns for index consolidation, and discuss how and when to remove indexes. At the end, you'll have a strategy that helps design indexes to improve performance.
