# Automation for the DBA: Embrace your inner sloth
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#922---Wellington-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Data Platform Administration, Performance Tuning  Optimisation
## Speaker: William Durkin
## Title: Automation for the DBA: Embrace your inner sloth
## Abstract:
### DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?
In this session we will learn to embrace the power of automation to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.
Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of automation expertise already available to us and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!

# Introducing SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#922---Wellington-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Strategy, Architecture, Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Ben Weissman
## Title: Introducing SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS, further scale out capabilities and Spark! 

In this session, you'll get an overview of the architecture as well as the capabilities of this amazing new featureset!

Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Strategy, Architecture, Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: Data Privacy, Security, Ethics and Compliance in a Data-Driven World
## Abstract:
### New advances in technology coupled with the rate of change in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Privacy and Ethics at the forefront of public consciousness – forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained, and constantly evaluated. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial Intelligence, and big data processing are providing new business opportunities that must also account for privacy and ethics issues while maintaining a balance with compliance, security, and integrity of data. 
But what are the issues that individual data professionals should be aware of to avoid reputational damage to their companies and themselves? And what are the tools that can help them in their endeavors? 

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks.

# Azure Cognitive Services using containers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#922---Wellington-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: AI, Data Science, Machine Learning  IoT
## Speaker: Raju RH
## Title: Azure Cognitive Services using containers
## Abstract:
### Azure Cognitive Services are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications. The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a non-cloud AI solution (because of limited Internet access or data compliance).Container support in Azure Cognitive Services allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, and enables flexibility in where to deploy and host the services that come with Docker containers. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, we’ll explore what it takes to configure and use containers support in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be

## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?
