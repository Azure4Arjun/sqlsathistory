## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2012 SSIS Development
## Abstract:
### Since its initial release in Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Integration Services has been incrementally improved in each subsequent version.  However, those changes were minor in comparison to the major enhancements, performance improvements, and new features introduced
in SQL Server 2012 Integration Services. These changes can be organized into the categories of development, deployment and administration. This presentation will be focused on what's new in SQL Server 2012 SSIS development.
