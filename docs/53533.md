## Abstract:
### Integrating security into your database design. Learn how to use roles, schemas and encryption to secure the data.  A very demo rich session that will introduce you to security on the database level. We start with understanding GRANT, REVOKE and DENY while working our way through the object hierarchy till we end up at the column level when we have a lock at encryption. This session will also cover new SQL 2016 security features and how to use them correctly.
