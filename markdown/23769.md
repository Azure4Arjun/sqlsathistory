## Title: Is SQL Server AlwaysOn the Right High Availability and Disaster Recovery Plan for me?
## Abstract:
### Do you need a high availability and disaster recovery solution for your mission critical databases?  SQL Server AlwaysOn can help, but with Windows Clustering, Failover Cluster Instances, and Availability Groups it gets confusing and complicated fast. I'll clear up all the confusion by explaining the various components and exposing all the gotchas.  There are different levels of protection and you will learn how to choose the right one for your environment.  You will walk away with the knowledge and confidence to pick the right solution to give your critical databases a solid high availability and disaster recovery plan.
