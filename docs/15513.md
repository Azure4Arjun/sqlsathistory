## Title: Custom SQL Server Transaction Log Shipping
## Abstract:
### Using a custom database transaction log shipping process instead of the built in SQL Server transaction log shipping component.  Custom database transaction log shipping has several advantages, including:
a)  The SQL Server instances need not have any connectivity to one another
b)   Applying of the transaction log backups can be suspended for weeks and then enabled, with the log shipped database being brought as
          current as the most recent transaction log backup.
      While transaction log backups are suspended, the Log Shipped Database can be placed in standby/Read Only mode, for querying.
c)  Using custom database transaction log shipping also allows more control over each part of the process.
