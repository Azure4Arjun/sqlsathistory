## Speaker: Matthew Sharkey
## Title: Data Mining techniques with R and Azure Batch Services
## Abstract:
### One the unique challenges Data Science teams face is provisioning compute resources.  High core counts are required for only short bursts and sit idle for long periods thereafter.  A demonstration will show how one can overcome this using Azure Batch Services. After attending the session one will be familiar with data mining packages in R, as well as how to configure and use Azure VMs directly from an R session.
