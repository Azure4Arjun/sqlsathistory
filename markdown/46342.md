## Title: New Paradigm for Performance Tuning in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is introducing some new tools for analyzing and troubleshooting queries that is going to change the way we do performance tuning. It's not just new tools, it's a whole new paradigm.

SQL Server 2016 will introduce the Query Store and the Plan Compare Tool which will help you to quickly analyze and troubleshoot problem queries, diagnose the root-cause of query slow-downs, force execution plans and prevent future plan regressions, and track actual execution plan run-time statistics.

Have you ever had a job run unusually slow at 2 AM? If you are using Query Store, diagnosing the problem is as easy as looking at the execution data and plan for the 2 AM execution.

Does a query run fast with one plan but slow with another? With the plan compare tool, you can compare 2 plans in the same window to identify what is the same and what is different.
