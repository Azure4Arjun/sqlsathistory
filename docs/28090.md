## Title: Through Gardens Overgrown: PowerPivot to SSAS 2012Tabular
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, Analysis Services Maestro and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews the steps required to “upgrade” an Excel PowerPivot model to an SSAS 2012 Tabular model using SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”).  We’ll discuss motivations behind moving to SSAS 2012 Tabular, including PowerPivot model size challenges for the client environment, both from the perspective of processing and querying optimization.  We will then undertake a walkthrough of the steps required to convert a model designed in PowerPivot to a server - level Tabular model.
