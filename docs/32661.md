## Title: Using Spatial Data Types
## Abstract:
### In this session explore the use of the SQL Server spatial data types.  We will see an example of the geography spatial data type used to represent data in a round-earth coordinate system.  Then the geometry spatial data type which represents data in a flat coordinate system will be demonstrated.  Both spatial types are CLR data types and provide a powerful way for businesses; such as; retailers to identify where their shoppers are concentrated, or for call centers to visualize the effect of top performers on others.
