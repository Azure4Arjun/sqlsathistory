## Title: State-based or migrations-based database development? The pros and cons...
## Abstract:
### For the last few years MS have been promoting declarative, state-based database development with tools like SSDT. For many this is the way forward – gone are the days of managing endless upgrade scripts and manual deployments.

At the same time, leaders and shakers of our industry including ThoughtWorks, Pramod Sadalge and Paul Stovell promote an iterative, migration script driven approach asserting that deployment scripts should be tested early and not generated by a tool.

I'm irritated that whenever I go to a “how to do database continuous delivery” session, the speaker invariably believes in one approach or the other and present their way as good and the other as bad. It irritates me so much I want to do something about it.

I’ll discuss scenarios from projects I’ve worked with to explain the pros and cons of each approach. I’ll describe which projects are better suited to state or migrations and I’ll discuss whether it’s possible to get the best of both worlds.
