## Title: Power BI Embedded for Fun and Profit
## Abstract:
### You COULD hire a front end developer to build data visualizations for your app. You COULD use "Publish to Web" to expose your sensitive data to anyone who gets a hold of the link. You COULD even force your users to leave what they were working on and tab over to the Power BI service to look at the data relevant to their current task.

None of that is fun, and it certainly isn't the most efficient use of time or funds. Fortunately, Power BI embedded is coming to your rescue. You can use the visualizations you've already built, keep the security you've already put in place, and allow your users to view contextual data in your applications-- right where they need it. You'll learn how embedding works within the Power BI service and how to create a successful embedded deployment.
