## Title: Creating an adaptive party domain model in SQL Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### People and organisations fulfill a crucial role in running a profitable business. Every organisation dealing with customers, employees, suppliers, to name a few, should have an easy to maintain, central master data repository to manage this data. If your master data is sorted, you ensure your business processes can fire on all pistons. How can you tackle this challenge in SQL Server Master Data Services without having to build 10 different domain models for each possible role? A flexible, adaptive party domain model is the answer.

In this session I will take you through the approach and the various modelling steps to set up a party domain model in the SQL Server MDS environment.
