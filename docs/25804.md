## Title: SQL Server Amnesia - Memory Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Losing your memory is never fun. Well, I can’t help you with that, but I can help show you how SQL Server is using its memory, and why it can't get more from Windows. Next, we will run through some demos on using Perfmon and DMVs to look inside SQL Server. These techniques even work on Grandpa SQL 2005 all the way to the latest version, and no matter how old you get, you'll never forget these tips. When we finish, you’ll be able to return to the office on Monday ready to troubleshoot your performance problems with new tips.
