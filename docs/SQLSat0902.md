## Speaker: Hemantgiri Goswami
## Title: Battle Tested Monitoring for Always On Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### You are the go-to guy for your company.  You are not only coding but also administering
SQL Server in your organization. You've also implemented one of the coolest High Availability
feature – Always On Availability Group. However, you are not sure if you are monitoring everything that you should and you don't have a commercial tool to help.
Lately, there were some issues reported where you have seen AG is lagging behind, and it has eaten up your time and effort analyzing what went wrong
I can help you here!! I can share some of the monitoring scripts that I have written, and I can show you some monitoring tips that can help you. I would also like to help you with some of the metrics/counters that you would like to capture for analysis to make sure your Always On Availability Group is healthy. These are the things that you would love to try and implement in your environment. By the way, have you ever think of getting this monitoring via a Power BI tool? If not, ready to see the repo

## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: Time to Solve your VLDB problems - Managed Instance Hyperscale Edition
## Abstract:
### Azure Managed Instances are one of the newest SQL Server related PAAS offering from Microsoft (Azure SQL Managed Instance went GA in September 2018). It can be considered a hybrid of Azure SQL Database and an on-premises SQL Server with all the great benefits of Platform as a Service.

Included in the Managed Instance Service Tiers is the new Hyperscale Storage layer.
Built from the ground up to take advantage of Cloud scalability this option offers an entirely new architecture  than can resolve the issue with  Very Large Databases (VLDB)

In this session we will explore 

What exactly are Azure Managed Instances
What the new Hyperscale storage layer is.
How it resolves VLDB issues and allows SQL Server to scale to 100TB+ 

Attendees will come away with an understanding of what  Azure Managed Instance HyperScale offers and where it makes sense to consider it.

## Speaker: Anil Maharjan
## Title: Microsoft Power BI, Python to visualize and predict connected car.
## Abstract:
### This session is mainly use to learn more about Power BI, Python and Azure ML and different visualization chart. How we can use Power BI and Python to visualize and predict the connected car from the IOT sensors related data of connected cars. 
From this session one can learn how can we make some simple and quick visualization using Power BI desktop taking IOT Sensors data and publish into PowerBI Service and find out the different possible scenarios in a smarter city with connected cars. Also, this session mainly helps to tell the story of connected car.
Overall, by using Power BI and Python and Azure ML how one can use analytics and prediction. So, this session will surely help one to learn regarding Power BI, Python and Azure ML and its capabilities.
