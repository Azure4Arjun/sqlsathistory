# Learn History from Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Ameena Lalani
## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Applying Forensic Accounting Techniques Using SQL And R
## Abstract:
### Forensic accountants and fraud examiners use a range of techniques to uncover fraudulent journal entries and illegal activities. As data professionals, most of us will never unravel a Bernie Madoff scheme, but we can apply these same techniques in our own environments to uncover dirty data. This session will use a combination of SQL Server and R to apply these fraud detection techniques, which include Benford's Law, outlier analysis, time series analysis, and cohort analysis.

# Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

# Temporal Tables in SQL Server 2016 and 2017
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Brian Carrig
## Title: Temporal Tables in SQL Server 2016 and 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduced the concept of a system-versioned temporal table. Further enhancements were added in SQL 2017. This is a type of user table that is designed to keep a complete history of all data changes to facilitate easy point-in-time analysis. In this session we will cover the basics of the internals of how temporal tables work, how to create them and their wide variety of use cases from auditing, to trend analysis and even recovery from data corruption.

# SQL Injection Attacks: Are Your Queries Secure?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Bert Wagner
## Title: SQL Injection Attacks: Are Your Queries Secure?
## Abstract:
### Sometimes using dynamic SQL is the only way to write a query that accomplishes what you need.  But did you know that dynamic SQL statements can leave you vulnerable to SQL injection attacks?

In this session we'll examine how SQL injection works and how we can write injection-proof queries through a series of examples and demos.  We'll also look at why some commonly used techniques aren't as secure as many people think.

If you ever write or maintain dynamic SQL queries, or work with developers who do, then this session is for you.   After all, do you really want to be the person responsible for allowing hackers into your database?

# Analyzing Your Workload with Query Store
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Analyzing Your Workload with Query Store
## Abstract:
### I've said it before and I'll say it again: Query Store is a game-changer for troubleshooting query performance. Yet when I ask people who are running SQL Server 2016 or higher if they're using Query Store, less than half say they are.  If you fall into that category, this session is for you.
We’ll start by discussing Query Store configuration. Sound a little boring? It won't be. There are multiple settings that affect how information is captured and you need to understand them. Next, we'll look at the data. Definitely not boring, as it's imperative you understand exactly what gets stored (and what doesn't) so you can find problematic queries quickly.  
Lastly, we'll mine the data in Query Store, and mining is more than just finding queries that use a particular index, or those that access a specific table. We’ll discuss different workload characteristics and how they affect system performance, and how to use Query Store to better understand your own workload.

# The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Amy Herold
## Title: The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
## Abstract:
### There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.

# Is My Application Bias Showing?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Is My Application Bias Showing?
## Abstract:
### Computers can't be biased, right?  I mean, it's just lines of code.  Yes or No.  Ones  Zeros.  Those lines of code are written by people.  People have life experiences that color how they see the world.  Okay, let's be blunt.  People have baggage.  And that baggage is seeping into your application, surveys and web forms.  
You've got an idea for a new app and it's going to change the world! Right?  It's a brilliant idea  no one has ever thought of it before.   You're working on the GUI for your company's web portal and you know just what information to collect from the user.  Are you sure about that?  Odds are pretty good that the information you're going to collect is a reflection of your life  your experiences.  
Learn how to identify bias when it seeps in, how to code to be inclusive instead of exclusive , and some quick tips  tricks to make sure you're accounting for all the users that will use YOUR application to change the world.  Instead of just the ones that look like you.

# Introduction to System Catalog Views and System Dynamic Management Views
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-736)
Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Luis Gonzalez
## Title: Introduction to System Catalog Views and System Dynamic Management Views
## Abstract:
### System Catalog Views are all about the catalog METADATA in your database. Using basic T-SQL queries they let you look for objects in the database such as Tables, Stored Procedures, Functions, and more. System Dynamic Management Views let you monitor the health of your server instance and database, assist in performance tuning and diagnosing problems. Both can be core sources of information that let you do your job faster and better. Sure, on the surface they can seem rather mundane, but they can save your bacon when your database goes sidewise and you have no idea what’s going on. Join me as we begin our flight at 50,000 feet exploring many of the different types of views available and what they can provide you, then push the yoke forward and dive toward the ground to get a closer look at several in detail. But don’t worry, just as it looks like we’re going to crash and burn we’ll pull back on the yoke and slide in to a smooth landing.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?
## Abstract:
### Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.
