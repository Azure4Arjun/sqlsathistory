## Title: SQL Server Security Features
## Abstract:
### SQL Server provides several several security features for developers and architects.  Features such as Dynamic Data Masking (DDM), "Always Encrypted", and Row-Level Security provide an additional level of security natively through the database server.  We'll explore the implementation of these features on the client/server for data in transmission or at rest.  In addition, we'll examine built-in features and custom implementations.
