# Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

# Statistics and Query Optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
## Abstract:
### There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

# Why should I care about the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly).

## Speaker: Steve Stedman
## Title: When Database Corruption Strikes - Will you be ready?
## Abstract:
### You are working along month after month with no problems in your database. Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating “SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error“, or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? We will walk through 3 or 4 actual corrupt databases exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you should do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn what to avoid that will make things worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to take when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time.

## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server instance running at its peak performance level?  Probably not but the real question is do you know why not? Is your disk subsystem too slow or are you lacking enough CPU’s or is it something else? It is very easy to capture and analyze the file  wait statistical information that is automatically provided by the SQL Server instance with several key DMV’s so why not utilize them. We will see how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which area of SQL Server performance bottlenecks are doing you the most harm. This should be part of every DBA’s arsenal so come make it part of yours as well.

# The Lost Science of Set Theory
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Aaron Cutshall
## Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory
## Abstract:
### Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.

## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Picking the Right Fights with Your Server Team
## Abstract:
### Being a DBA is more challenging than ever—virtualized infrastructure, tiered storage and the cloud mean you may not know where you servers are, what disks your data is on, and you have less control than ever. In order to keep your databases performing and to provide an optimal environment you have to pick your battles. You have limited capital, and you only want to pick the most important fights.
In this session you will learn about how to choose battles and win (with data!):
•	How to configure storage and file systems for SQL Server
•	Why you should always compress your backups
•	How your virtual machines should be configured for SQL Server
•	What rights you and your servers need in Active Directory
•	Many more and more importantly—which battles NOT to fight
After attending this session, you will have a good understanding of how to talk with your peers in the infrastructure teams and make sure the key SQL Servers in your environment have the resources they need to perform great.

## Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

# Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections
## Abstract:
### You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used.

## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions. We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

# Use Hive and Hadoop for High Performance Data Warehousing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Use Hive and Hadoop for High Performance Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### Big Data has moved beyond the hype and entered the mainstream as a tool for managing large and unstructured data sets, giving data architects more options for managing data. The Hadoop ecosystem has become the tool of choice and Microsoft has entered this arena with HDInsight in the cloud. For DBAs this means having a place to store data that can be accessed using a highly parallel framework. In this session you’ll see how to use the numerous tools available to store data in Hadoop, process it, manage it, and retrieve it. We’ll explore Sqoop and how its many options can be configured to import data by taking advantage of Hadoop’s massive parallelism. We will develop and run Map\Reduce code, with an emphasis on understanding what belongs in a mapper function versus what belongs in a reducer function, while demonstrating Hadoop Streaming with languages such as R and C#.  Finally, Hive will be shown to exhibit the use of a high-level query language in Hadoop for those who prefer SQL.

# What is a Latch, and Why Should I Care?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#436---Las-Vegas-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: What is a Latch, and Why Should I Care?
## Abstract:
### Latching is a necessary function of the database engine. Although latching is a topic is normally presented only in expert-level sessions, a good grasp of the problems excessive latching exposes is important even for novice tuners. This session focuses on the PAGELATCH_* and PAGEIOLATCH_* wait types, explaining what is happening, why it is happening, and how to use the exposed information to tune queries and solve performance problems. If you've seen these wait types in Activity Monitor and wonder what they meant, then this session is for you!

## Speaker: Ted Stathakis
## Title: Graphs, Charts, Gauges, Sparklines Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of the classic pick parameter/run report routine?  If you’re not I bet your users are.  Leverage Reporting Services (SSRS) to turn those same reports into an interactive “dashboard” where users simply click their way around the data.  Add some graphical splash to make you reports come alive.  In this session designed for people comfortable with SSRS looking to take their implementation to a new level we will go beyond charts and graphs and explore other representations of data.  You will see how utilizing dynamic action buttons in report headers combined with sub reports and drill through reports can significantly improve user interaction and analysis of the data.  Come see what you can do without a great deal of effort to take your SSRS solution to a new height.

## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.
