## Title: Beware of the Dark Side - A Guided Tour of Oracle for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### Today, SQL Server DBAs are more than likely at some point in their careers to come across Oracle and Oracle DBAs.To the unwary this can be very daunting and, at first glance, Oracle can look completely different with little obvious similarities to SQL Server.This talk sets out to explain some of the terminology, the differences and the similarities between Oracle and SQL Server and hopefully make Oracle not look quite so intimidating.At the end of this session you will have a better understanding of Oracle and the differences between the Oracle RDBMS and SQL Server. Although you wonâ€™t be ready to be an Oracle DBA it will give you a foundation to build on.
