## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Digging Out From Corruption
## Abstract:
### A "Disaster" doesn't need to be on a massive scale to cause widespread destruction in your enterprise. Simple things like failing hardware, strange storage bugs, a forgotten WHERE clause, or an angry employee can either cause devastation or be just a nuisance to the properly-prepared DBA. This session is a survey of recovery techniques that should be in every DBA's toolbox.
