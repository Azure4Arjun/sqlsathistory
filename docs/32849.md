## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.5
## Abstract:
### If you were in the 1.0 session you’ll love this one.  In this session we’re going to pick up where we left off and really get into some real SQL Server admin tasks.  We’ll start with some more advanced basics to enhance your knowledge of powershell, and then apply them directly to SQL Server.  By the end of this session you won’t be an expert, but my goal is to make you competent enough to be able to understand blogs and articles about powershell.
