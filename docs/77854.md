## Title: Discovering SSRS 2016 in Azure:  Dataset to Deployment
## Abstract:
### Dataset to Deployment (to Azure!!?) in one session, seriously?  Well, it depends.  Sixty minutes is not enough time to become an expert on how to create a dataset, develop a report with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and deploy the report to a Report Server in Azure; but you can become familiar with the SSRS components and the report deployment process.  Whether you are new to 2016 SSRS or have some SSRS experience, there’s something to learn for everyone.  
In ‘Dataset’, we’ll talk about different options and ideas to create a good dataset.  Then in ‘Develop’, we’ll look at the various components inside SSDT; building a report along the way.  In ‘Deploy’, we’ll walk through the steps to configuration and deploy the report to a Report Server sitting on a VM in Azure.   Yes, Azure! 
By the end of the session, you will be more familiar with the SSDT environment and the report deployment process.  You won’t be a pro after this one session, but you will definitely be on your way!
