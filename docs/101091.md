## Title: Introduction to building Machine Learning pipelines and models using ML.NET
## Abstract:
### f you're a .NET developer, you may be forgiven for thinking that in order to build awesome machine learning applications, you'll have to brush up on your Python skills in order to use ML libraries.

With the release of ML.NET, this is no longer the case!

In this session, I'll cover what ML.NET is and how you can use it to add machine learning capabilities to your .NET applications. I'll cover the capabilities that the API offers in terms of preparing our data and evaluating our models. I'll also talk about the capabilities that the ML.NET Model builder and how that can simplify how we choose what type of model we want to build. I'll also talk about how we can deploy our models into production.

By the end of the session, you'll know how you can leverage your existing C# skills to use ML.NET to build machine learning applications!
