## Speaker: Christoph Seck
## Title: Agile Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### Changing requirements, obscure sources, surprising successes - are DWH projects ideal candidates for agile approaches? It's not that easy. No matter if on-prem or “modern” with big data and on Azure: Fixed price requirements, challenging stakeholder setups, missing test cases and often the sheer size of the action, point in a different direction. So, what should be "agile" in DWH projects? And what are the actual benefits?

After a brief reminder of what makes BI / DWH projects "different", we first look at a practice-proven agile approach (test and backlog-driven, etc.). Extra bonbon: Agile projects  fixed price.
Afterwards the reality check: What exactly qualifies this process as "Agile”? Are there hidden waterfalls? And which advantages or risks are we dealing with?
We close with discussing how to adapt this to your specific projects and the old debate SCRUM versus Kanban.
