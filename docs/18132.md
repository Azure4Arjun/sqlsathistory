## Speaker: Kent Chenery
## Title: PowerShell for Beginners
## Abstract:
### You've heard about PowerShell but the amount of braces, at symbols and percent signs reminded you of a painful Perl experience.
You're frustrated at having to run the same piece of code on all your servers time after time?
You've only accidently clicked on the PowerShell icon and thought "white on blue is nice, but what makes this so good?"
You've heard its something to do with .Net, but you're a DBA and .Net is just for developers right?

If that sounds like you, then this session is for you.  We will cover some basics of PowerShell and take a look at some of the things it can offer the DBA and make their life a little bit easier.
