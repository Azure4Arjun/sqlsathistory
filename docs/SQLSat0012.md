# Performance Tuning with SQL Server 200
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#12---Portland-2009)
Event Date: 06-06-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Buck Woody

# XML and Relational Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#12---Portland-2009)
Event Date: 06-06-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Eric  Wilson
## Title: XML and Relational Databases
## Abstract:
### Well established relational database principles help us decide when and how to use the XML features in SQL Server. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of first normal form ("1NF") and how to apply 1NF to XML related database design choices. If you think (like many DBAs) that XML is a curse or (like some developers) that XML is a cure-all, this presentation is for you. Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we should do over just a list of features and syntax.

## Speaker: Paul Bertucci
## Title: High Availability on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you need five 9's of uptime? High Availability of applications and databases are rapidly becoming the "norm" around the globe. It is clearly one of the hottest topics that is important for database administrators, data architects and system architects to fully understand and to plan for. 

This presentation covers assessing, planning, choosing, implementing and administering a high availability solution along with the business justifications of different approaches to achieve high availability (including SQL Clustering, Data Replication, Database Mirroring, and Database Snapshots).

# Perf Testing 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#12---Portland-2009)
Event Date: 06-06-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Rob Garrison
## Title: Perf Testing 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption
## Abstract:
### Everyone is getting hit with data security requirements. SQL 2005 introduced column-level encryption, but there are drawbacks to using it. The big security news in SQL Server 2008 is Transparent Data Encryption.

On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security "silver bullet". The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

How much will TDE affect performance in an OLTP environment? This session will help you understand what TDE offers, discuss the list of caveats, and explain the performance testing and results.
