## Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting for SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

•	XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
•	Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
•	Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
•	Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.
