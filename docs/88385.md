## Speaker: Kirill Kravtsov
## Title: The wonders of modern SQL Server administration
## Abstract:
### Ever been tired of doing the same action over and over again? Chaining together RESTORE DATABASE sequences from the backup files? Wrapping statements into dynamic T-SQL to collect information from remote instances? Migrating multiple databases to a different server(s)?
Surprisingly, each of the tasks above - tasks that require a lot of manual effort and attention to details - can be done with writing just a few lines in a Powershell console! 
During this session you will see by yourself how easy it is to automate mundane processes using collective knowledge of SQL community. The session will introduce dbatools Powershell module that was written by DBAs for DBAs, and will showcase many regular DBA tasks converted to a concise scripting language:
* Backup/restore databases
* Environment healthchecks
* Configuration
* Maintenance
* Database migrations
* And many more!
