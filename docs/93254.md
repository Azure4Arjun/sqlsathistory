## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Modern Infrastructure Fundamentals for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Since we live in a world where physical deployments are more the exception than the rule, the infrastructure underneath our databases is similar, yet very different. There is still CPU, disk, and memory but what does that actually mean today? 

This session will update the core infrastructure concepts anyone responsible for SQL Server should know whether you have physical, virtualized, public cloud, and container-based deployments. As a bonus, you will be able to work better with the other administrators back in the office now that you can speak their language. 

If you want to ensure that your SQL Server deployments are available, reliable, and perform well, this is the session for you.
