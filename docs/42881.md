## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### Differences between physical and virtual server environments adds a new layer to administrative tasks. This extra layer will result in an environment where metrics used for performance troubleshooting are often unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance.

This presentation describes the metrics DBAs must use in their performance and monitoring practices.
