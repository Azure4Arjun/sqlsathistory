## Title: Power Query in Modern Corporate BI
## Abstract:
### In a Corporate BI environment, it is common having data available in controlled data sources such as Data Warehouse, relational Data Marts, and Analysis Services cubes. Consuming this data with self-service BI is very useful, but how do you manage and validate the access to corporate data sources? How do you share and validate new queries created by end users? How can users extract data at the right granularity level? Power Query bridges the gap between corporate and self-service BI. It empowers end-users so that they can extract and manipulate data from several data sources, inside and outside of the company. In this session, learn the Power Query best practices that enable the extraction of data from existing database and cubes, guided by an expert who understands both worlds (Corporate BI and Power Pivot data models).
