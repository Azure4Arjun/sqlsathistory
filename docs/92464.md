## Title: Hadoop, Hive, and Big Data For MSSQL Professionals
## Abstract:
### At times, we find ourselves learning new platforms and integrating them with our tried and true solutions. This session will be a primer for those that find themselves in a similar situation of going from MS SQL Server to the Big Data landscape. We will discuss an overview of Hadoop, including HDFS, Hive, and Spark along with a somewhat deeper description of Hive and how knowledge of TSQL and MS SQL Server can translate to HiveQL.
