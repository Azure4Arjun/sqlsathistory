## Speaker: Davide Mauri
## Title: Real Time Power BI - API, Hubs and Streams
## Abstract:
### Power BI - I bet you already know what it is - also offers a nice API set that allows you to program it directly from you application so that you can push data directly to Power BI Dashboards and have them updated in real time. Or, even better, you can create a little bit more complex solution that will live in the cloud and uses Azure Event Hubs to ingest data, Stream Analytics to do some streaming query and finally Power BI to visualize it. And you can even put Azure DW in the game (and probably you should)
In this session we'll all this stuff, how it works together and how it can help us to create a very cool and useful Cloud Modern BI solution.
