## Title: Share The Code, Man
## Abstract:
### How to Incorporate Enterprise Code in SSIS Processing.  
For many SSIS scenarios, a desired outcome is to implement logic or rules that are used in existing enterprise applications, only to do so in an a bulk data loading scenario.  Many times the logic being applied is complex and multi-step.  We will examine various scenarios where complex logic from shared code sources can be applied in SSIS processing scenarios.    
1. How to implement complex logic using code in SSIS
2. How to use code from shared enterprise sources
3. Using logic from external services
4. Performance comparisons.
