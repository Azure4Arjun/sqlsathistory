## Title: Demystifying Clustering for the DBA
## Abstract:
### The word cluster is used a lot in the IT world, especially when it comes to SQL Server. We have clustered instances of SQL Server, availability groups that require Windows failover clustering ... but how does a DBA make sense of it all? Wonder no more! This session will explain all the forms of clustering as they relate to SQL Server (including how Windows fits into the picture) and give you some of the top keys to success whether you are using an older version of Windows and SQL Server, or you're looking to deploy the latest and greatest.
