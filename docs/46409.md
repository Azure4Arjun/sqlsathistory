## Title: Full day precon: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.
SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
•	Reliable
•	Resilient
•	Reusable
•	Maintainable
•	Well performing
There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.
In this full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices.
