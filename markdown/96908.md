## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: WIT Panel: Celebrating Women Computing Pioneers
## Abstract:
### Most people do not realize that we can thank women for many of the technical innovations we enjoy today. In fact, Ida Lovelace wrote computer code 100 years before the first computer existed! From space travel to encryption, women’s contributions have made a big difference in our lives. Those who have gone before us are also responsible for the opportunities we have today.

In today’s WIT session, you’ll hear how our panel of successful technical women have been inspired by computing pioneers and their own mentors. You’ll also have a chance to win a copy of Melinda Gates’ new book!

Panel will include: Gina Meronek, Theresa Heroff, Monica Rathbun, Ashley Day
