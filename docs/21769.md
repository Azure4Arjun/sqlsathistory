## Title: Contained Database - Huh - What's a Contained Database?
## Abstract:
### Many people have never heard of a Contained Database let alone know why they would use a Contained Database.  In this session, I will go into the WHAT is a Contained Database, the HOW a Contained Database works, and the WHY I would use a Contained Database.  We will use, both successfully and unsuccessfully, a Contained Database through Management Studio, Integration Services, Reporting Services, and a Web Application (Visual Studio MVC).
