## Title: Being Smarter with Azure Machine Learning and R
## Abstract:
### How to get a better insight about the current situation of organization by analysing the Data? How we can predict the next step? Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science, which is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Azure Machine Learning is a valuable tool that can be employed by data scientists with different skill levels. Azure ML also supports R custom code, which can be dropped directly into your workspace. In this session, I will show a demo of interaction of R language with Azure Machine Learning, uploading R package into Azure ML, preparation of the data in R, and  How to publish a R code into Azure ML.
