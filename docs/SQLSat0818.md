## Title: Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… 

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages, this is the right session for you!

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
## Abstract:
### ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, all ORMs suffer from the same flaws.
