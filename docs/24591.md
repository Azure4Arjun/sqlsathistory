## Title: Interrogating the Transaction Log 
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA, I believe that the transaction log is the most important file in any database.  Join me to learn why I believe that.  You'll learn how to see a transaction process in the log, what happens when a transaction rolls back, and what the architecture of the transaction log looks like.  Plus, you will see how transactions involving SQL Server 2014's in-memory object are handled by the log.
