## Title: PowerShell - Grow Your Script From Simple to Module
## Abstract:
### With todays features within PowerShell developers are able to create the most advanced functions imaginable.

We're talking about multiple functions interacting with each other, parameter validation, pipelines, use of the -WhatIf, modules, classes etc.

If you're someone who wants to learn more to upgrade your current scripts to advanced functions, come to my session. I'll show you in a couple of easy steps how a simple script can be turned into something beautiful. 

Have you written a couple of scripts but want to get them to the next level. Than you'll want to attend this session and we'll see how far the rabbit hole goes.
