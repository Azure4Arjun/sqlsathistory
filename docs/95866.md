## Title: Non-relational faces of SQL
## Abstract:
### Despite the diversity of processed data, the approach to their presentation still has a lot in common. I'd like to tell you about tools, which have their own approach to SQL language. We will see how NoSQL in MongoDB, OQL in Pivotal GemFire ​​and KSQL in Apache Kafka can imitate the most popular elements of the SQL language.
