## Title: Step by Step SSIS Import Package Creation
## Abstract:
### Go step by step to create an SSIS package to import files. This will use SSIS variables, loops, expressions, and passing variables to SQL Server. The 6 objectives covered are:
1 - Read multiple files from a folder with changing file names
2 - Import to a Raw table
3 - Include a step to clean data into a Staging table
4 - Log the file name and the number of rows imported
5 - Move the imported file to a Done folder
6 - Send an email report for each file imported
