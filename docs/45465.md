## Title: A Window into Your Data: Using SQL Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Window functions and the OVER() clause are an underused feature in T-SQL. These functions can help you solve complex business problems such as running totals and ranking. If you have never used these functions or are looking to solve ranking and aggregate types of calculations without using GROUP BY, join us for a demo filled session on SQL window functions. We will also look at some of the performance implications of using these functions.
