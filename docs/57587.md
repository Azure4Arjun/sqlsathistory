## Title: BimlFlex: A Flexible, Extensible, and Completely Customizable Data Warehouse Framework
## Abstract:
### You might have heard about the benefits of using Biml or other automation approaches to build your own metadata-driven reusable data warehouse and BI framework. What if you don't have the time to build your own framework, and would rather customize an existing framework? Enter, BimlFlex.

BimlFlex is built with the power of Biml and metadata-driven automation while employing the best and most commonly used modelling philosophies (Kimball, Inmon, DataVault). BimlFlex was created in collaboration with Biml experts and offers full transparency to users at every opportunity. Whether using traditional or modern data warehouse architecture, BimlFlex has you covered.

With BimlFlex, requirements are entered into Microsoft Excel enhanced by our BimlFlex Add-in and then stored in a machine-readable metadata database. The BimlFlex code uses this metadata to automate the creation of all your data assets, transformations, and documentation.
