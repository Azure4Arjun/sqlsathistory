## Title: "Real World" Examples on How to Load Data Warehouse Structures using SSIS
## Abstract:
### "Real World" Examples on How to Load Data Warehouse Structures using SSIS
 
In this session we will discuss the value of a SSIS Framework, explore forward engineering benefits, and demonstrate SSIS design patterns on loading SQL structures when developing Data Warehouses, SSAS Cubes, and Power BI Analytics.

Live Demo SSIS Framework
                Load  Error Meta Data
                Restart ability, Rollback, Reload Count
                Master Load ID, LoadID, ExecutionID (SSISDB), Refresh
                Package Sequencing and Signatures
                Connections, Expressions, Parameters, Event Handlers 
                Alerting (SMTP), Error Flows (XML Destination Script)
                
Forward Engineering SQL Structures
                Relationships, Primary  Foreign Keys
                Data Types, Nullability, Indexes 
 
Demos for Multiple Design Patterns
	Dimensions (Slowly Changing)
	Facts (Inserts, Updates, Deletes)
	Bridges / Snowflakes
