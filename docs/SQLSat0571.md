## Speaker: Rob Douglas
## Title: Are You High?  Can You Recover? - HA and DR in SQL Server.
## Abstract:
###  A look at the options for providing High Availability and Disaster Recovery using the  native features available in SQL Server.  This session will cover the basis of how the technologies work, what is(and isn't) protected and a list of the advantages and disadvantages of each technology.

## Speaker: Jonathan Stewart
## Title: Data Visualization:  How to truly tell a great story!
## Abstract:
### We have more information available to us today than ever before.  So much so that we run the risk of not being able to tell concise stories.  There's a lot more to creating that story than just getting the correct information.  Come learn not just the do's and don'ts, but the whys…

# Introduction to the Query Store
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#571---Auckland-2016)
Event Date: 15-10-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Dave Dustin
## Title: Introduction to the Query Store
## Abstract:
### Query store is an awesome new feature in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database that allows you to store the history of query plans (what SQL Server turns your SQL statement into), including detailed data on performance, making comparison with previous versions of a statement easy. 

The Query Store also lets you identify queries that may degrade performance over time and make necessary adjustments.
I#39;ll show how easy it is to work with the Query Store and work with query plans.

## Speaker: kokila kondasamy
## Title: Restoring SQL Server Database to Old Version
## Abstract:
### In this session , I will demonstrating the approach for restoring SQL Server Database to older version( like restoring SQL server 2014 database to SQL Server 2012) using Microsoft azure cloud migration tool.

# Temporal Databases in Microsoft SQL server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#571---Auckland-2016)
Event Date: 15-10-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Amit Arora
## Title: Temporal Databases in Microsoft SQL server 2016
## Abstract:
### Introducing Temporal Databases in SQL Server 2016

More and more organizations are storing archives of data to help them make important business decisions. Traditionally, organizations had to rely on expensive, and tedious methods to go back in time and make sense of growth, negative growth, profit, loss, etc.

Microsoft SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Temporal Databases which essentially solves all the problems mentioned above.

This presentation aims to go deep into Temporal Databases (requirements, use cases, technical know-hows) and present some demo’s in order to gain specific understanding on this new feature which is being called “Time Travel”.

# Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#571---Auckland-2016)
Event Date: 15-10-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Kevin Alcock
## Title: Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks
## Abstract:
### Kevin will be talking on the topic of SQL injection - something that all of us need to be aware of and protect against. 

And here is a blurb from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection

" The best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query. For SQL calls, this means using bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, and avoiding dynamic queries. 
Checking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely. Code analysis tools can help a security analyst find the use of interpreters and trace the data flow through the application. Penetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability."

Kevin will give us a demo that will show an injection attack in action and how to mitigate it.

## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: Adding Power to the DBA toolkit!
## Abstract:
### Interested in being able to manage, monitor and document your SQL Environment from a single location? Want to be able to produce modern interactive reports and dashboards that can be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices? 

By adding a little "Power" to your DBA toolkit you can!

By combining PowerShell and PowerBi with the more traditional DBA tools I will show how to query and document your entire environment and produce rich interactive reports that can be consumed by all levels of your organisation.

## Title: Security in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Come to this session to learn how to leverage security in Power BI. Share Power BI report with colleagues, or publish it to web, or through an office 365 group. You will also see how to implement Row level security on different data sources either through Power BI security itself, or applying security in the data source level of SSAS Tabular or SQL Server. This is demo heavy session all about Security in Power BI

## Title: DW SuperHero-Columnstore Index
## Abstract:
### Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL 2012. They have the superpower to boost SQL server performance by flipping row based indexing to column based indexing. In this session, we will cover basics of this technology, its usability, performance impact, implementation (through demo), access mechanism and what's new in SQL 2016.

## Speaker: Leila Etaati
## Title: R; One Ring to Rule Them All
## Abstract:
### R is one of the most popular and powerful analytics languages. That helps data scientists to prepare data, predict data, and visualize it. Microsoft offers several deployment options to bring next-generation advanced analytics to your business. Microsoft R Server delivers R-based analytics to where your data lives. Processing analytics in-place eliminates data movement, reducing latencies and operational costs. 

In this session, first basic concepts of machine learning will be discussed. Then, a demo of how to use R for data cleaning, visualization, and prediction will be presented. Subsequently, an introduction to use R server and R in SQL Server 2016 will be shown. Finally, a brief introduction on how to use Azure ML with R will be shown.
