## Speaker: Tom Staab
## Title: Introduction to Partitioning
## Abstract:
### We all know that a smaller table is generally faster to retrieve data from than a larger one. What if you could split your very large table into a set of smaller tables but still query and manage them as if they were 1 table? Would that improve your query performance? In this session, we'll examine table partitioning and how it works under the covers to do just that. I'll demonstrate how to configure and manage partitioning (including the magic of SWITCH and sliding windows) and give some examples showing the performance benefits.  Finally, we'll take a look at partitioned views and compare/contrast those with partitioned tables.
