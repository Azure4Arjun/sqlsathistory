## Title: Exploiting SQL Server Security Holes
## Abstract:
### Most flaws in SQL Server can be avoided with proper security policies ... as long as those policies are followed. What can happen if they are not followed or security is very loose? A lot of people will tell you what not to do, but has anyone ever shown you what can happen if you do them anyway?

This demo heavy session will show you just what I could do in these situations if I was so inclined to exploit these lapses in security. You will learn how to prevent these security holes to ensure you are protected.
