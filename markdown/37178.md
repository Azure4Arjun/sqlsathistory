## Title: Who Has What to Which? (The Permissions Superset)
## Abstract:
### Do you know who has access to your database and what permissions they have? If you answered yes, you're most likely wrong. Permissions in SQL Server don't work the way almost everyone think they do. We'll look at different scenarios you are likely to see day-to-day and explore what permissions the users are actually getting (likely not what you expect).

This exercise will demonstrate why it is important to be strict about granting permissions and cleaning up old security accounts. You will learn how to think of permissions as a superset.
