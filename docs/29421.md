## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 will allow you to significantly improve the processing time of common data warehousing queries without creating cubes, aggregated tables, or other techniques normally used to improve performance.  This session will show how to implement this new type of index in SQL Server and demonstrate their advantages compared to traditional solutions.  Carlos will also discuss the scenarios for which columnstore indexes should be implemented to provide powerful but flexible BI solutions.
