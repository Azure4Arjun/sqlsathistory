## Speaker: Dave Noderer
## Title: My IOT Journey
## Abstract:
### I have been building an IOT device "AirMon" and will share what I've done, the tools I have used, how the decisions were made and what future refinements I want to make.  It is still a work in progress but what I am learning should be helpful to others. Topics covered include devices, networks, Azure IOT Hub, Azure Functions, Azure WebApp and hardware design.
