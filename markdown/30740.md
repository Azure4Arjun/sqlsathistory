## Title: Modeling Muddy Data
## Abstract:
### Unfortunately, the real world isn't always as cut and dry as third normal form; sometimes things get muddy. What do you do then? This talk will examine the use of NULLs, sparse columns, XML data types, and other ways of storing data with a murky format. This presentation will introduce techniques for common data modeling problems and examine potential patterns and practices for working with flexible data modeling that can be immediately useful in real-world scenarios.
