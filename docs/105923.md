## Title: Power BI: Advanced development techniques
## Abstract:
### Power BI usage and report development is quite simple to get started. You can produce fantastic reports in a relatively short amount of time.

How about extending the available functionality? How to achieve consistent look and feel? These are important topics, as we get deeper into creating more than couple of views and PBIX files.

In this session, I will show you how you can use database queries, custom theme files, custom visuals, parameters and other techniques to make your development efforts easier and keep your users happier.
