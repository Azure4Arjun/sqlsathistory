## Speaker: Robert Cain
## Title: PowerShell Core for Linux
## Abstract:
### With the advent of SQL Server for Linux, you need a tool you can use to manage it. Sure, you could try to learn bash, python, or some other tool, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to use a scripting language you're familiar with? Or maybe you are a long time Linux admin, now having to work with all this new Microsoft technology. Wouldn't it be great to leverage tools that make your life even easier?

In this session you'll learn all about PowerShell Core for Linux. You'll see just how quick and easy it is to install PowerShell Core, then interact with it from the terminal. But wait, there's more! You'll want a good editor to compose your PowerShell Core scripts in, and that's where VSCode comes in. You'll see how easy it is to install VSCode, then work with your PowerShell Core project within it. 

We'll wrap up the session showing how to install SQL Server in a Docker Container, all using PowerShell Core!
