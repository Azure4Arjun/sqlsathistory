## Title: Lightning-fast management of cloud and legacy databases, breaking vendor lock-in
## Abstract:
### With the infrastructure increasingly moving to the cloud, developers are stuck with legacy tools, suboptimal for the new workflows. Current reality is slow and unreliable web applications bundled using Electron - or native applications that look like they are made 20 years ago.
We have started from scratch, imagining the ideal database manager for modern times. UI responds to your actions in less than 0.1 seconds and your data stays in the cloud. Connection switching is instant and the workspace is preserved between devices and application restarts.
A sneak peek - state of the art SQL code translation solution - removing vendor lock-in.
This is a work-in-progress report, detailing why it's so hard to get right and why does it take so long to make something seemingly simple - not a sales talk, not a self-congratulatory talk.
