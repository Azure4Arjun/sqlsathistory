## Title: SSIS ETL for Type1 and Type2 SCD
## Abstract:
### How to handle and track changes in a data warehouse dimension table is an important dimensional modeling consideration.  The dimension tables of a data warehouse need to be designed to appropriately store a history of attribute changes over time.  The ETL processes need to detect these changes and correctly update the dimensional table to preserve historical accuracy.  Finally, fact records need to be associated with the correct historical version of the dimension.  In this presentation, a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) will be demonstrated that creates an ETL data flow which will load a dimensional table with both Type 1 and Type 2 dimensional attributes.
