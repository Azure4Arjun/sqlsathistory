## Title: What's new in SQL Server 2012 - TSQL
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, the T-SQL language has been extended further to enable greater productivity and more optimal queries.
Following the ANSI SQL standard support has been included for PAGING and SEQUENCES. Many cumbersome sub-queries will be banished by the clutch of new analytic functions, but perhaps the biggest is the window framing extensions.  These now allow a true sliding window of data to process such common problems as rolling balances.

This will be a high-level look session, but will be diving a bit deeper to highlight some caveats as we go as its not all plain sailing.
