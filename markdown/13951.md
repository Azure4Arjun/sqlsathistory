## Title: A Systematic Approach to ETL Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### ETL performance tuning can be an especially challenging task, largely because of the number of moving parts in the process. From extracting the information from the source system, to staging in SQL Server and transforming into the relational data warehouse, to processing new information into the cube, there are so many things that can contribute to exceeding the specified batch window.

In this session, we’ll look at the high-level system as a whole and discuss possible areas contributing to a lag in performance. We’ll also talk about implementing instrumentation components to monitor all aspects of the ETL solution, using SSIS 2012's Catalog. We’ll use this monitoring data and an example case study to walk through the process of tuning the ETL system to make sure the data warehouse is consistently available at the required time.
