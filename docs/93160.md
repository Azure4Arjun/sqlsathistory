## Title: Smart Alerts for Azure SQL Database using Automation  Logic Apps
## Abstract:
### If you've dipped your toe into the waters of Azure SQL DB, you'll know that there's no SQL Agent available. Fortunately there are many options available to get you over this hurdle. One of these is Azure Automation, a scheduling engine which runs PowerShell or Python scripts to perform your tasks. As a bonus, these Runbooks can also be triggered from Azure SQL DB alerts. This session will introduce Azure Automation, from a basic, manually executed Runbook to an alert-driven responsive utility that can save you considerable effort. We'll then take Alert responses a step further and use them to trigger an Azure Logic App workflow - a utility that provides a robust workspace with built-in scalability  retry logic along with a multitude of connectors which can expand the response to your alert. Imagine being able to capture an Alert, perform the remedial action, log the issue  response in your ticketing system and switch on your kettle so you can sit back and let Azure do it all for you.
