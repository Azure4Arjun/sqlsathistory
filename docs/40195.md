## Title: Rethink Your Data Model and Make It Super Fast
## Abstract:
### Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow. After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model. There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB
