## Title: The User Experience of Data Systems
## Abstract:
### The modern business is demanding advanced analytics to drive decisions.  However, businesses are discovering that more data does not always equal more value.  What good is a petabyte database if no one can make sense of the data?  User Experience is not just the domain of mobile apps and web sites!  Every developer should know how to effectively present and deliver data.  This session will examine user experience principles and techniques and how to apply them to Reporting Services, Power View, and Excel.
