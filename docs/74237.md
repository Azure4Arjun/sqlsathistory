## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size. Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is often too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially if not production. More importantly, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive. The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is very true with data.

Because providing full databases for each developer on each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared non-production environments that are refreshed only every few months at best. Conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Clone things easily and quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.
