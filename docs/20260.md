## Title: Spatial Data with SQL Server Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Spatial Data Visualization is one of the key new features of SQL Server Reporting Services. This feature was introduced in SQL Server 2008 

R2 and continues to evolve in the new SQL Server 2012. SQL Server provided geospatial data from SQL Server 2008 and you may have 

noticed (or perhaps used) the two geospatial data types in SQL Server: geometry and geography. In this lecture we will talk about how to 

visualize spatial data in the SQL Server Reporting Services, creating Map reports. We will learn how to set reporting services and how to use 

spatial data with this product. Samples will demonstrate work with Reporting Services for both SQL Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server 2012.
