## Title: Introduction to Azure Data Factory Service
## Abstract:
### Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data. Just like a manufacturing factory that runs equipment to take raw materials and transform them into finished goods, Data Factory orchestrates existing services that collect raw data and transform it into ready-to-use information.

In this session, we will review key concepts associated with Azure Data Factory to understand how key entities work together to define input and output data, processing events, and the schedule and resources required to execute the desired data flow.
