## Title: Automating Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### Many SQL Server performance issues can be solved with the information available from the DMVs, even if it is collected only after the problem occurred. But management might ask why something that was not an issue yesterday became an issue today i.e., who is to blame? On modern server systems with many powerful processors cores and massive memory, problems may be infrequent, but they do still occur. And so we may have neglected to collect and archive data on a routine basis. It is equally important to collect sufficient information to fully diagnose and a resolve a problem. Too many (all?) third party tools seem to stop after identifying a problem on the presumption that the the DBAâ€™s responsibility ends with passing this information to someone else. To this end, I have automated the collection and partial analysis of index usage, query execution statistics and executions plans in my own tool ExecStats (http://www.qdpma.com/ExecStats/SQLExecStats.html)
