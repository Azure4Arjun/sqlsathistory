## Title: Provisioning Dev/Test environments efficiently (speed/storage) whilst protecting your data
## Abstract:
### As data professionals, we need to aim towards the most efficient way of provisioning production data to non-production environments while remaining compliant with data protection regulations.
We also need to make sure that this process is performed as quickly as possible and at the same time ensuring that it uses the least amount of storage.

With the effective usage of virtualization and data masking capabilities, provisioning full copies of protected databases takes a few seconds and saves up to 99% disk space.
SQL Provision helps create, protect and manage SQL Server database copies for compliant DevOps without increasing the risk of a data breaches.

On this session we will learn how to:
- Protec our data and Easily comply with regulations
- Create cloned databases (fast and with minimum storage requirements)
- Automate the provisioning process.

SQL Provision supports database DevOps while keeping compliance central to the process.
