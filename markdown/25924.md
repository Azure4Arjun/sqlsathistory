## Title: Windows Server 2012 R2 High Availability for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### With the increasing adoption rate of virtualization, creating SQL Server clusters is now within reach of many more DBAs. What do you need to know about Windows Server 2012 (R2) virtualization and high availability to set up your first cluster? What's needed for geo-clustering? Come learn from a Windows Server admin and (accidental) DBA who's been building SQL Server clusters since 2000 (the year and the version!). We'll discuss initial planning, the process and the maintenance best practices. There will be demos too, so if you want to see a multi-node SQL cluster run on a Lenovo X230 tablet, come see (it's pretty cool!).
