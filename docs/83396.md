## Title: 10 Years of Highs and Lows as an Independent Consultant
## Abstract:
### 2017 marked the 10th anniversary of when I left the world of being a full time employee to being an independent consultant. Back then I was just trying to make it to year two. Ten years later, I've learned a lot and I'm still standing with a few battle scars to prove it. Join me as I discuss what it takes to be (and survive as) a consultant, lessons learned - both good and bad, and how you can apply the principles of consulting even if you are a full time employee to step up your game.
