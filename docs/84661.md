## Title: The  DATA⋅CLOUD Talk
## Abstract:
### This talk connects the dots between quite some tangents ~ the obvious and the not-so-obvious/forgotten/new-ish aspects of DATA (Big Data, Small Data, Tiny Data, Data Lakes, Data Reservoirs, Micro Data, Macro Data), and CLOUD (Hybrid, Global, Microsoft, Non-Microsoft) available as of this point-in-time (Aug-2018) ~ and some other thoughts. 

AUDIENCE:  Decision makers, decision influencers,  or anyone interested in how DATA tangos with the CLOUD, and the resulting INFORMATION (actionable or otherwise).

PRE-REQUISITES: none

SPEAKER DISCLOSURE:   Tex (20+ year technologist) is with Hybrid Decisions®, a multi-competency Microsoft Gold Partner (consistently since year-1) and OpenSource/Linux (originally C/Unix folks who embraced Microsoft  OpenSource/Linux) … speaking on behalf of HCCUG.org
