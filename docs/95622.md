## Title: How does the recursive CTE work?
## Abstract:
### We all know CTEs and the recursive version of it. But how does it work internally? Why sometimes it can produce an unexpected result?

If you want to know how does recursive CTE work internally, want to know more about non-blocking, blocking and semi-blocking query plan operators, want to familiarise yourself with the spools, asserts, compute scalars - come to this session. I will analyse the whole query plan flow, describe the internals of the used operators and show you other situations where they are useful (or not).
