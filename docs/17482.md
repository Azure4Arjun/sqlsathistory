## Title: Matching and Survivorship
## Abstract:
### The spectrum of Contact Data Quality covers numerous interrelated aspects such as parsing, standardization, correction, verification, enrichment and matching. But one crucial concept that is quite commonly overlooked in the field of data quality is the implementation of an intelligent and automatable process for the creation of the “golden record” through the consolidation of data within the matching process; a technique also known as Survivorship.
