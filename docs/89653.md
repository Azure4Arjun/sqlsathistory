## Title: Taking back control of your work using Kanban
## Abstract:
### Do you and your team feel overwhelmed by the amount of outstanding work? Are your clients constantly complaining because work is not being delivered?  Do you think that despite throwing time and resources at every project very little seem to get done? Kanban may be for you.

Kanban is a method of managing work with a focus on continuous delivery, this means that there is a steady stream of completed work going out the door and resulting in more efficient use of developer time but more importantly happier clients.

You will be introduced to the concepts behind Kanban, finding that it is one of the most natural work methodologies to setup and scales well from one person teams through to large enterprises. While there are many tools, many of them free, you can still get going with nothing more than a few sticky notes and a whiteboard.
