## Title: SQL Server using Amazon Web Services EC2 Instances
## Abstract:
### You have just been informed that you are moving to AWS. Now what? In this presentation, weâ€™ll cover the ups and downs of using AWS Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) instances for your SQL Server. We will show you how to make an EC2 instance and install SQL Server on it; go over networking, security and routing services; and demonstrate how to make a simple, highly available, two-node availability group. By the end of the session, you should be on the right track to start using AWS in your environment.
