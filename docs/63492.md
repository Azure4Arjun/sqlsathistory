## Title: Advanced Biml Concepts
## Abstract:
### After you get started with Biml you quickly find yourself getting more and more complex with your solutions. In this session, we walk through the end game of Biml.  What would it take to get to full automation in your BI solutions?  At the end of this session, you'll have a game plan to get to that point.

At the end we discuss the implications of automating your solutions: what do we do when we no longer need a SSIS developer?
