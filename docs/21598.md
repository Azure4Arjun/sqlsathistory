## Speaker: Oz Locke
## Title: SSRS - After the Begining (formerly But SSRS Can't Do That)
## Abstract:
### You’ve gotten your head around SSRS — how to set up datasets, how to make tables and charts, how to add parameters — and know you’re looking for more. This sessions will add to what you already know and teach you some nifty things you may have thought you couldn’t do.

Among the topics covered will be mastering export formats, creating user driven branding, making the most of parameters and using your reports’ metadata to control how they behave.
