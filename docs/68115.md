## Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Tools and Tips for Data Warehouse Developers
## Abstract:
### Have you ever accidentally pressed the wrong combination of keys, stared at your screen in utter confusion, then spent the next ten minutes trying to figure out what you just pressed that did that really cool thing?

In this session, I will show you some of what I have learned and discovered that has made me say "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" - including features in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL Operations Studio (SOS), keyboard shortcuts, free tools and scripts, Biml for SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.
