## Title: Integrating Azure ML with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a robust tool for building data visualizations that help businesses derive insights from their data.  Azure ML is a flexible tool that allows iterative development and deployment of predictive models across an enterprise.

It can be difficult, however, to productionize a machine learning model and present the findings to a business user in a manner that is easily-consumed and reliable.  Combining Power BI and Azure ML businesses can easily leverage predictive models and present the results in a user-friendly way.

This talk will cover the basics of Power BI and of Azure ML, how to build and deploy a model using Azure ML Studio, alternative options to Azure ML and Power BI, and demonstrate how to easily score data from an existing SQL Server DB using Power BI.
