## Title: Inheriting a database for Developers
## Abstract:
### There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams.

This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :)

The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.
