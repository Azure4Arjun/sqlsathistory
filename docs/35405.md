## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: The DBA Script Thumb
## Abstract:
### This session will present a top 10 (maybe 20) list of queries and tools that DBAs can use daily. The idea is that everything is included on a single 1G or less thumb drive to be portable. From simple T-SQL statements to full blown SSIS packages, the session demonstrates how to interogate, diagnose, report on, and resolve issues that are most prevalent for DBAs: disk space, security, backup locations, database and server documentation, performance and much more. All queries, which are SQL 2000, 2005 and yes even 2008 tried and true will be made available in the session to copy to your own thumb drive. If you are lucky you might even receive a free coveted thumb to store the queries.
