## Title: Tame the sibling rivalry of the Lock, Block, Deadlock sisters
## Abstract:
### Deadlocks present a problem to many DBAs.  Deadlocks can be minor occurrences or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a victim like constantly quarreling siblings.

We will review locking, blocking and deadlocking.  We will review isolation levels.  When would be an appropriate time to use each.   We will also review how to identify locks and deadlocks and how to lessen the family fighting.
