## Title: Lunch: Performance Troubleshooting with DMVs
## Abstract:
### There are many tools for a DBA to use for performance troubleshooting. One of the best tools are Dynamic Management Views and functions (collectively referred to as DMVs). DMVs offer insight into the inner workings of SQL Server and helps you identify symptoms and track down root cause. The trick is knowing which DMVs to use and how to interpret the data. This session will detail the DMVs that are most useful in troubleshooting performance problems and will show you how to use the information to reach resolution.
