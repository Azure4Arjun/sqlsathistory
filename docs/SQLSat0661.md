# SQL Injections and How to Stop Them
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#661---San-Diego-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Jeff Prom
## Title: SQL Injections and How to Stop Them
## Abstract:
### Right now, there are hackers all around the world trying to get into your web applications. How safe are you? By using a technique called SQL injections, hackers can wreak havoc on web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, choking system resources, retrieving sensitive information, and modifying database objects. Without proper precautions, attackers can even drop databases! 

During the demo, we will take on a couple of different roles. As a hacker, we will walk through steps a hacker might take to compromise a web application in order to retrieve sensitive data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. Assuming the role of a developer, we will then show various prevention techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injections.

Attend this session to learn how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and how to stop them!

## Title: JSON and the Astronauts
## Abstract:
### In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#661---San-Diego-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight
## Abstract:
### This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: Diagnosing SQL Amnesia: Where is Your Memory Going?
## Abstract:
### Memory problems in humans can be caused by injuries, traumatic events, or
physical deficiencies, and interestingly enough the same holds true for SQL
Server!  In this preconference seminar you'll learn about common patterns
and problems that affect SQL Server memory usage and how to solve them,
based on real world scenarios. From incorrectly-sized hardware for a
specific workload to code and schema design challenges that tax SQL Servers
memory usage, this seminar will give you the practical tools necessary to
tackle even the most challenging memory problems.

Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Speaker: Peixin Wang
## Title: SQL Server 2016 and R Service introduction
## Abstract:
### Introduction of R in SQL Server R service
One of the biggest changes in SQL Server 2016 on the analytics front is the inclusion of R into the database engine.  SQL Server R Services is the result of Microsoft’s acquisition of Revolution Analytics. R is a popular open-source data analysis language that’s used by data scientists, statisticians and data analysts for data analysis, data exploration and predictive modeling. R can produce both data analytic results and data visualizations. However, in the past, the use of R in an enterprise environment involved several challenges. By marrying R with its core data platform, Microsoft is signaling that it is serious about advancing its analytic offerings not only in the cloud, but on-premise as well. This presentation will tell why it’s important for SQL developer to know R and vice versa.

## Abstract:
### Have you ever worked on a database used by more than one person?  ;-)  If so, then this session is for you!  In this session we'll talk about what happens when multiple processes compete for the same resources  (aka "Concurrency").  We'll break down SQL Server's isolation levels, and the trade-offs between concurrency and such scary-sounding things as "dirty",  "phantom" reads. There will be practical demo's and some real-life examples "from the trenches".   There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this topic, you may be surprised!
