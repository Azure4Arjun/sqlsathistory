## Title: #06 | Big Data Fundamentals with Azure HDInsight
## Abstract:
### Big Data is a phrase used to describe large, possibly complex datasets. With today's data explosion of devices and sensors, technology is responding with new ways to practically and economically store and process the resulting Big Data.

This session describes the fundamentals of Big Data and Hadoop, leading to the introduction of Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based Big Data service: Azure HDInsight. The session includes numerous demonstrations to show how files can be archived in the Azure Blob Store and then efficiently processed with a cluster of servers. The demonstrations will introduce Hive, a query language designed to ensure that Big Data remains approachable to database developers, and the integration of Big Data into a conventional Business Intelligence (BI) solution.

This session will be of interest to those new to the concept of Big Data and interested to understand the challenges that it is designed to solve.
