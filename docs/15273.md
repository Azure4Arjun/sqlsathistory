## Title: SQL Server Advanced indexing techniques
## Abstract:
### SQL Server indexing is an art. Choosing the right index for the right solution might just not be enough. Options are also without boundaries, but still there are several rules you must always apply to design an effective indexing strategy. Join me in this session and find out about these rules, how the SQL Server optimizer chooses an index and most importantly - is your index useful enough or is just a burden to your database.
