## Title: 7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers
## Abstract:
### We have all come across those great developers in our careers. They seem to fall into the right answer and make it look so easy to deliver great quality software so quickly. The true is though it is not an innate ability but the application of many deliberate practices. Practices that help to avoid distraction, staying blocked to long, break down problems, and many others.
