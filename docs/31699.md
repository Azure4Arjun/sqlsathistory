## Title: Report Calcs - SSRS Source Query vs. Expressions
## Abstract:
### As a report developer, you want to ensure your reports are structured for accuracy, performance, maintenance, and reusability.  One of your many decisions includes where to perform report-specific calculations when the source is a SQL Server relational database. 

In this session we will compare and contrast a sampling of functions available in T-SQL and SSRS, with an emphasis on handling aggregation, ranking, dates, and strings.   A "cheat sheet" will be available online for future reference.

Session Goal:   Identify common situations when performing calculations within SSRS is preferred, versus when the T-SQL source query may be more appropriate.
