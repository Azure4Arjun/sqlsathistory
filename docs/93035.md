## Title: Migrate Your Database(s) with Distributed AGs
## Abstract:
### You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will explain the purpose and usages of Distributed AGs, create a Distributed AG and the associated AGs, and perform a mock data center migration.

NOTE: This session expects that attendees are already familiar with Availability Groups.
