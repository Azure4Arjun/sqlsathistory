## Title: Increasing SQL Server Availability Options Using SIOS DataKeeper
## Abstract:
### Whether you are deploying on premises (physical or virtual) or up in a public cloud (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform), your SQL Server databases and instances need to be highly available. Some options, such as Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs), are not easy to deploy when you need some form of shared storage and traditional storage methods are not accessible. Other times you have storage performance requirements in addition to availability that cannot be met by traditional solutions such as a SAN. Come to this session to learn how SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition can enhance your SQL Server deployments to help you achieve high availability, disaster recovery, and storage performance goals.
