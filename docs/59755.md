## Title: Much Ado About Hadoop
## Abstract:
### If you're interested in Hadoop but don't know where to begin, this session will give you an idea of what you can do with the open-source platform.  We will see an overview of the Hadoop architecture, becoming familiar with the overall platform and its solutions for warehousing, ETL, streaming data ingest, in-memory processing, and more.  We will compare Hadoop to SQL Server to help gain an understanding of when to deploy which technology.
