## Title: Intro to Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Come to this session to get your toes wet with machine learning. What types of questions it can answer? What types of models it can produce? What are some techniques used? There will be practical demos using Azure Machine Learning as well. Enough info to get you started, or enough to quit while you're ahead, either way, you'll come out with some concrete ideas of what ML is all about.
