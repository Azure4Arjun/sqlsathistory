## Title: Using PowerQuery to track progress in tuning a stored procedure or complex view
## Abstract:
### Tuning a lengthy stored procedure or complex view can be a challenge. Set Statistics IO On, and have fun wading through lengthy output. Use PowerQuery to organize that output for you so you can see where intensive operations are and how your tuning is progressing. 
The focus of this session is PowerQuery, not stored procedures , views or the tuning process. Learn how to read all text files in a folder with PowerQuery, parse the files to retain useful data and then analyze using either Excel or PowerBI. In the process, learn the basics of the PowerQuery Formula Language.
