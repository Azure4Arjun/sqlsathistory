## Title: Interject - Are you prepping for the Data Apocalypse?
## Abstract:
### The era of unchecked data costs is about to end.

Gartner predicts 80% of the data workforce to be outsourced by 2021. What can we do, as data professionals, to prove our value? How can data literacy become an organizational imperative before it's too late?
