## Title: Azure SQL DB Hyperscale for OLTP  HTAP
## Abstract:
### SQL DB Hyperscale is a cost effective VLDB, fully managed SQL PaaS option. It shares the same Azure SQL Server engine, retaining compatibility for application, the storage is fundamentally redesigned from the ground up to be cloud-born with cache-miss reads of under 2ms. The Hyperscale architecture supports separation of compute and storage, allows for dynamic scaling of CPU, memory, and compute nodes in constant time, regardless of database size. Database backup and restore also in constant time, regardless of database size (RPO 0 minutes, RTO less than 10 minutes). High availability supports one primary read/write, up to four read-only replicas, which also serve as hot-standy in case of automatic failover. Come find out more about this exciting, optimized for OLTP and HTAP database option.
