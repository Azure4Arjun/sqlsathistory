## Title: 5 Common SQL Server Performance Issues
## Abstract:
### I spend a large portion of each day looking through performance reports and dashboards from various organizations around the world. I've identified some very common performance problems and/or misunderstandings that tend to have easy, though not always obvious, solutions.

I intend to share the whys and hows of these issues with anyone who would like to attend during a SQL Saturday session.
