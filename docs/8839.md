## Speaker: Aaron Nelson
## Title: SQL Server Database Development with SSDT 
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Data Tools is an evolving product.  Besides revamping database projects this product has also changed the lifecycle in which we receive new features.  In this session we will demonstrate features such as database snapshots, localdb, and database unit testing.

Most importantly weâ€™ll show the many benefits of the Publish feature, and why you will want to use the built-in refactoring instead of just renaming objects.  Throughout this presentation we will also highlight and demonstrate the features that have been added to SSDT in the past year.
