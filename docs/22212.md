## Title: Self-Managed BI with PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 PowerPivot will allow analysts to use Excel 2010 to load and prepare large volumes of data from various data sources to create a data model. The data model can then be enriched with calculations to become a data source for Excel PivotTable, PivotChart and CUBE function reports.

And as compelling as these BI experiences can be thatâ€™s not the end of the story. A PowerPivot workbook deployed to SharePoint Server 2010 can be used to create even more compelling BI experiences using Reporting Services and PerformancePoint Services.

In this presentation learn about the fundamentals of PowerPivot data model creation, and the exciting ways PowerPivot data models can be used to visualize and share data.
