## Title: The Magic of SSISDB
## Abstract:
### The purpose of this presentation is to provide a better understanding of SSISDB and how it can be utilized to make the lives of developers and DBAs easier.
This presentation will demonstrate how to use SSISDB to script out deployments of folders, projects, environments and packages, and dynamically assign environment variables.  We will write scripts to run our SSIS packages and use SSRS to kick them off.  We will learn how to create SSRS Reports that recreate the All Executions and All Messages built-in reports and make them available to user developers.
