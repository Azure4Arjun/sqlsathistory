## Title: ASP.NET Web API
## Abstract:
### In recent years, the WCF team at Microsoft has released multiple REST services, while the ASP.NET team has helped developers build basic APIs by allowing JSON to be returned from MVC controllers. ASP.NET Web API is a joint effort by both teams to provide a single RESTful API framework.  This session will cover the basics of how to use ASP.NET Web API to build simple HTTP services.  We will start with a new MVC 4 project and build a functional API that can be consumed by numerous clients in order to query and manipulate data from the host.
