## Title: Resistance is Futile: What You Need To Know About Big Data
## Abstract:
### The data community is all abuzz about Big Data, and for good reason. Much like Business Intelligence before it, we're rapidly approaching the point where all data professionals should have at least a cursory understanding of what Big Data is and how it fits into an organization. To that end, this presentation will provide an overview of what Big Data is, discuss some common use cases for Big Data across a variety of industry verticals, and explore some common architectures for integrating relational and analytical data with Big Data. We'll conclude with QA and an overview of resources for learning more.
