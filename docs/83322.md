## Title: Building Great Services
## Abstract:
### I am responsible for several Azure-based microservices at Microsoft that are consumed internally and exposed to customers through PowerApps, Dynamics 365, and more to come in the future. In this session we will discuss the following qualities that help make-up a great cloud based service: reliable, scalable, secure, compliant, and supportable. This is an architectural level discussion with no code.
