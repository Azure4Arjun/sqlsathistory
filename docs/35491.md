## Title: Revitalizing a neglected SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on how a SQL Server installation becomes neglected over time, how to identify neglected components, and how to revitalize the neglected installation. In many cases a client may report specific performance issues or errors, but after investigation, it becomes obvious that the underlying issue is more widespread and results from lack of maintenance or planning. Learn how to survey a  SQL installation for problems, and how to correct them.
