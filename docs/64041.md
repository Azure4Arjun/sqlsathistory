## Title: Upgrades  Rollbacks for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Are you facing a big SQL Server upgrade but are not quite sure how you will tackle it?  In this presentation we will discuss what we learned during our 2008 R2 upgrade to SQL 2014.  We will go through how we met our RTO, RCO, rollback, testing, and actual cutover process. 

We will utilize setting up and testing mirroring to move the data from 2008 to 2014. We will migrate the IP of the old 2008 cluster to the new 2014 cluster.  This way no clients change their connection strings as DNS is not an option in this environment.  Trans Replication will be set for rollback to the 2008 cluster in case we need to after going live.  We will use the 'no init' option as we do not have time to create a snapshot and will protect the data during the upgrade to ensure no writes are conducted.

Scripts and a background on transaction replication will be provided to show the end user how to start testing this process in their environment.  Pre-cutover and Post-cutover tasks will also be discussed.
