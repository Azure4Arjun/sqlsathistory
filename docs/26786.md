## Speaker: Tim Costello
## Title: Agile Data Warehouse Design
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what should go in a fact table and what belongs in a dimension?  Have a suspicion that you’re forgetting important dimensions?  Wouldn't it be great if somehow your design was self-documenting?  In this session I’ll give you a couple new tools and show you a new way to look at your star schema.  We’ll go past ‘why’ to see ‘how’ dimensional design is a great fit with the agile principles.
