## Speaker: Daniel Taylor
## Title: More than Just a basic Database Backup and Recovery
## Abstract:
### During our time together we are going to take a quick look into backup and recovery techniques for Full, Differential, and log backups. We will then take a look at how SQL Server keeps track of what will be included within out differential backups.  While we’re at it lets look at our transactions logs prior to and post log backups. Next up we will look into advanced recovery scenarios such as piecemeal, point in time, file group, and page recoveries.  If you manage databases or like doing recoveries let’s have some fun together during this sessions.
