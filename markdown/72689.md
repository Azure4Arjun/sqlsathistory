## Title: RPO, RTO  SLA: Three Letter Words for When the S H T Hits the F A N
## Abstract:
### A Production DBAs job is to protect the data, ensuring it is well cared for and secure. But what about disasters you can't prevent? Corruption, unintended modifications or deletes or hardware failures? It's important for DBAs and their end users be in agreement in how their data is handled in the event of a disaster (or even what constitutes a disaster). In this session we'll look at the two most important recovery metrics (RPO  RTO) and how to handle the expectations of your end users in regards to their data.
