## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Teaching Your Servers to Call For Help
## Abstract:
### DBAs need to regularly monitor their servers for a regular health check. Running the daily checklist becomes tedious and requires a lot of time. In this session, SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will teach you his signature "See Something, Say Something" method. You'll learn how to use the SQL Agent to turn the daily checklist into actionable alerts. By leveraging the SQL Agent severity alerts and some basic scripting techniques, you'll stop mindlessly going down a checklist and instead have your servers tell you when there is a problem.
