## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: The 2012 Data Warehouse Architecture Debate
## Abstract:
### Data vault is a compelling new architecture for an enterprise data warehouse. Star schema data warehouses are the most well-known design pattern in the industry.  Are hub, link and satellite tables your cup of tea or are you more of a fact and dimension type of person?  Come with an open mind to our session and cast your vote for the architecture that you prefer.  No matter which way you vote, you will come away with a deeper understanding of the data vault and star schema architectures, the pros and cons of both, and new implementation techniques to leverage new features of SQL Server 2012.
