## Title: Query Folding in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power Query allows you to extract and transform data from a variety of data sources. Have you ever experienced that the importing of data is slower than you expected? In most of those cases, query folding is not happening fully optimized.
Query folding is important because it offloads data transformations to the source, instead of performing them in Power BI.
Attend this session to learn how to ensure that you get all the performance improvements possible within your reports! As a bonus, you will also learn in which cases query folding is not your best friend.
