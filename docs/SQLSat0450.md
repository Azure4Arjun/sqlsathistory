## Speaker: Tanja Vukov
## Title: Saved by the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Its quite easy to find business cases where IoT, Stream Analytics, Machine Learning and PowerBI are used as standalone technology or in a synergy. As environmental biologist I am using “Microsoft glasses” to look, understand, and change ecosystems around me. By using this technologies I will show you that their purpose is not just to make your business better but to make our planet a safer place to live.

Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 14:05:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Satya Jayanty
## Title: Power BI- best practices to deliver just-in-time insights
## Abstract:
### We will overview a detailed options about how to deploy Power BI, how to implement configuration parameters and package BI features as a part of Office 365 roll out in your organisation.

Having said that, cloud computing is another aspect of this technology made is possible to get data within few clicks and ticks to the end-user. Let us review how to manage  connect on-premise data to cloud capabilities that can offer full advantage of data catalogue capabilities by keeping data secure as per Information Governance standards.  Not just with nuts and bolts, performance is another aspect that every Admin is keeping up, let us look into few settings on how to maximize performance to optimize access to data as

## Speaker: Tanja Vukov
## Title: Azure Machine Learning - drag, drop, predict
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (AML) changes the way we work with data and what knowledge and skills are required in order to predict outcome of future events.  AML is a comprehensive “drag, drop, predict” technology with all the benefits of the cloud.  The transfer of machine learning to the new platform with ability to use R programming language makes common machine learning tasks very simple for the different customers and academic community.

## Speaker: Marcin Szeliga
## Title: Data Science approach for (Azure) Machine Learing
## Abstract:
### „Knowledge is power” said Sir Francis Bacon two hundred years ago. Now prediction is power. That is the reason why data science is so needed. If you want to know what is Data Science, what are reasons for Machine Learning, who is Data Scientist and how to become one of them, join this session. We are going to design an sample experiment using Azure ML score them, publish model as Web service and consume it.

Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 14:05:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Catalin Gheorghiu
## Title: Databases on mobile devices
## Abstract:
### You are a Windows Phone developer or just a mobile developer and you need a database locally, on the device, a database, what are your options? And really how do you sync you data with the big database? What you can do, what you cannot do, and how? How cloud is changing this story?  These are a few of the questions this presentation will try to answer, the focus be on Windows Phone (the easiest to demo, but not ignoring the “others”). The actual industrial devices will be also covered. 
And of course all with as much demoes and code as possible.

# Easy ETL with Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#450-Bucuresti-2015)
Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 14:05:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Marcin Szeliga
## Title: Easy ETL with Biml
## Abstract:
### Can ETL be fun? Unfortunately, very often creation of ETL layer is time-consuming, tedious, error-prone task. What’s more, any change in requirement needs most of the work to be redone. In our session we’ll present new approach to creating BI solutions using Biml language and Mist programming environment. They greatly simplify the process, allowing for amazing flexibility, and make the ETL work more pleasant. We will show real examples of how Biml and C# generates hundreds of usable SSIS packages in just couple of minutes. We will also cover integration of ETL with TFS and CI for ETL. Everything with 100% compatibility with unmodified SQL Server. Join us and see how BI just became fun again

## Speaker: Catalin Gheorghiu
## Title: IoT and SQL (Server)
## Abstract:
### Or IoT for DBAs
And we are not talking about Oracle Index Organized Tables, we are talking about Internet of Things. This buzzword you hear almost everywhere, and for sure needs databases. So let’s take the Microsoft vision of IoT and see the database side of it. We will talk about the vision of IoT and the real world practicalities of it. The presentation goal is to provide a DBA all he/she needs to know to support an IoT application.  And to make you curious we will cover topics such SQL 2014 for Embedded Systems or the Azure offerings (and their SQL connections), and I will try full demos with IoT hardware.
