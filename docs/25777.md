## Title: Beyond Power Pivot - Building Tabular Model Solutions
## Abstract:
### So  you have built this awesome Power Pivot model and deployed it SharePoint.  Now you need additional security or better processing strategies.  What do you do?  Migrate the model to a SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Model.  In this session, we will explore those features that make the Tabular model more robust than a Power Pivot model.  We will walk through migrating and updating a solution to take advantage of security, partitioning, and other Tabular model capabilities.
