## Title: Machine LeaRning for Data Competitions and the future of the Data Scientist
## Abstract:
### Through the participation in one data competitions, we will explore how we can use quot;Rquot; statistical and algorithmical capabilities. From using quot;caretquot; framework to the direct usage of the algorithms. How is critical to define a clear strategy to provide different solutions and how the feedback of the submissions should be incorporated in the models.

Based on this exploration and the broad knowledge generated in other competitions we will speculate about the possible automation of the model generation, that could lead a redundancy of the model provided by the modeler (the Data Scientist). This speculation opens interesting questions about the concept of Self-Service Analytics.
