## Title: Becoming DAX: An Introduction ... 
## Abstract:
### The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language is a library of operators and constants that we can combine to craft formulas and expressions in PowerPivot Client. In this introductory session Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson will concentrate upon crafting simple DAX expressions whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. Heâ€™ll overview a simple data source structure, outline the components of simple DAX syntax, and get you started understanding basic expressions.
