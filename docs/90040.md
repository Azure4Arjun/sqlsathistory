## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Boosting Performance of SSAS (Sponsor)
## Abstract:
### Are you a DBA who does not have a background in SSAS or BI? Perhaps you're a BI analyst but never had to troubleshoot SSAS performance issues?
 
Join me for a mostly vendor-agnostic exploration of SSAS performance challenges. We'll break down SSAS workload and discuss factors that impact SSAS query performance. To close, will I show a brief demo of SentryOne's BI Sentry to bring everything together. 
 
When you leave, you will be armed with new insights into SSAS and how to tackle performance challenges.
