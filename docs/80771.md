## Title: Data Science in Reverse: Creating Credible Fake Data Sets
## Abstract:
### Sometimes a data professional will find themselves in need of a large demonstration data set.  However, non-proprietary options are few and usually lacking.  This session will educate attendees in how to get around these obstacles by creating their own data.  We'll talk about the process of using real-world variability, creating inconsistency that leads to insight using some basic statistical concepts, the process of putting everything together, and getting the data set into SQL Server.
