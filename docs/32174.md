## Title: Dashboard Design: Making Reports Pop
## Abstract:
### Create a highly-visual reporting experience in SharePoint with SQL Server Reporting Services integrated with SharePoint 2010. See how to use BI report design elements like sparklines, KPI indicators, gauges and maps to make important business information jump off the screen and get usersâ€™ attention. Create highly-interactive reports with dynamic drill-down, drill-through and super reports that morph as users interact with the data. Build an interactive dashboard using PerformancePoint/Insights and Reporting Services together.
