## Title: Avoid Errors on Errors
## Abstract:
### Did you know that BEGIN TRANâ€¦COMMIT TRAN is not enough to make everything work together? People are often shocked when they see the demo where there are errors in a transaction and it still commits. When SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action or control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome to the way you want it. This is a very common workplace faux pas and a Microsoft Certification topic for Dev and Admins. We will use lessons from SQL Programming Joes 2 Pros Vol4.
