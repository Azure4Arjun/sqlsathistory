## Title: Microdata For Microservices
## Abstract:
### Applications continue to get more complicated and distributed as inexpensive hardware becomes more and more ubiquitous. Currently the trend is to lead more towards a microservice paradigm when ti comes to large scale application development. 

The missing piece of the puzzle for most companies when it comes to micro services is "How does data fit in?" I hope to answer that question and give you and your organization some strategies on handling massive amounts of data and massive amounts of productivity in a highly concurrent/maintainable way.
