## Title: Women in Technology Panel: Skip the Corporate Ladder and Still Win in a Tech Career
## Abstract:
### Many of us have attended career advancement or women in technology panels where they only tell you how to become part of the C-level, (CTO, CIO, CDO or even CEO).  Although these sessions may focus on valuable skills, they often require the individual to move away from technical work to advance.  
What does it say about the world of tech if the only way up is to give up the part of tech you love the most?
This panel session is for the women, (and men) who want to know how to make the most of the career they have and get ahead in technology without having to give up the technology they love.  
The panel will be led by Kellyn Pot’Vin-Gorman, who’s made a career from deeply technical positions and rose to the top of the Oracle world as a Multi-platform Database Administrator/Developer, recently becoming a part of Microsoft as a Data Platform Architect.  She will be joined by a group of panelists in various stages of their career to share their experiences, insight and advice.
