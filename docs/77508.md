## Title: Big Data in SQL Server Panel with Ronen Chenn  Elad Shwarchberg
## Abstract:
### Big Data is everywhere these days. There are a lot of Big Data scenarios, from IoT (Internet of Things) to AI (Artificial Intelligence). The common challenge to all of these scenarios is to handle very large volume, velocity and variety of data (a.k.a “the 3 V’s”). There are plenty of data platforms to handle Big Data scenarios. Some of them are NoSQL databases, while others are relational. Some of them are open-source, while others are not. Some are MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) platforms, while others are SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) platforms. In many cases, SQL Server is not the right choice, and you should learn about other data platforms and choose the best one to handle your workload.
On the other hand, SQL Server offers a lot of features and capabilities to handle Big Data scenarios, and in many cases, it can be the best solution.
