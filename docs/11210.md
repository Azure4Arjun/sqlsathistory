## Speaker: Carlos L Chacon
## Title: "I Know What You Did Last Query" --SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Starting with the 2005 release, SQL Server captures information about the workload on an instance, which you can use to monitor the system, gather performance metrics, and validate system settings.  This information is available via Dynamic Management View and functions and officially they "return internal, implementation-specific state data." This session gives an introduction to these concepts, how they make DBA life much sweeter and we discuss many of the different community queries available to help you get jump started in your environment.  We also open up the floor for ideas of how you are using these views/functions.
