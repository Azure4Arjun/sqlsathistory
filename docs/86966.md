## Title: Large-scale graph querying and analytics with SQL Graph
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL DB introduced capabilities to store and query directed graphs in the database, with further improvements in SQL Server 2019 and recent Azure SQL DB releases. As with any new feature, scalability is a top question. In this session, we will demonstrate the features and scalability of SQL Graph by using a publicly available graph dataset: the Open Academic Graph - OAG - (https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/). The OAG graph includes over 166 million academic publications and over 1 billion citations. We show you how to efficiently import such large-scale graphs into SQL and then fully leverage the SQL Graph features to accomplish common graph query tasks (finding citations) and advanced analytics (PageRank, Shortest Paths etc.) on this large-scale graph. After this session, you will be amazed by the functionality, performance and scalability of SQL Graph!
