## Title: Microsoft Cloud Data Platform
## Abstract:
### Did you know that the Microsoft Data Platform is more than just SQL Server? Microsoft's new and exciting cloud offerings include the RDBMS we all know and love, but also big data, NoSQL, streaming analytics, and even some platforms you would might not expect....like Oracle, MySQL, Mongo, PostgreSQL, Hbase, Storm, Kafka, and more.

In this session we will cover the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud Data Platform, from IaaS to PaaS, big data to RDBMS; all on Azure.
