## Title: Panel: Will the DBA Job of the Future Still Involve DBAs?
## Abstract:
### While technologies have been changing rapidly since databases were born, the basic tasks a DBA has performed have been a stable foundation of professional database design and support.

But in the last few years, NoSQL technologies ("it's schemaless!"), cloud ("our databases are managed elsewhere!") and recent SQL Server features ("it's new and improved!") will have an impact on DBA jobs, tasks and careers.#160; 

Our panel of SQL Server experts will share their #160;current experiences in the data profession.#160; They will share what they believe you should be working towards now and in the future.
