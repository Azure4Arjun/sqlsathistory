## Title: Query performance monitoring and graphical analysis
## Abstract:
### Based on concrete practical examples, this lecture deals with the SQL Query Performance Monitoring and the analysis with the intuitive fully graphic DBPLUS Performance Monitor â„¢. The lecture answers the questions: How do you quickly identify among thousands of SQL queries the basics of CPU, logical, or physical IO at a specific time or in history? How to find changing execution plans and analyze them historically over time? Which queries were executed for the first time today or are responsible for a peak load at a certain time? Which queries access a specific table? How can I compare and visualize load profiles historically in seconds? And how does that even work starting with SQL Server Version 2005 without the Query Store and no need for knowledge of DMV's?
