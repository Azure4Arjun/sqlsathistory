## Title: Tame the sibling rivalry
## Abstract:
### Deadlocks present a problem to many DBAs.  Deadlocks can be minor occurrences or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a victim like constantly quarreling siblings.

We will review locking, blocking and deadlocking.  We will also review how to identify deadlocks and how to lessen the family fighting.
