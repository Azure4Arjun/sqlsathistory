## Title: Practical Uses for SQL Server 2016 Dynamic Data Masking
## Abstract:
### Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) allows database administrators to obfuscate data columns containing sensitive data from unauthorized users without changing the data stored in the database.  This new features has some limitations that prevent it from being used as the only mechanism for securing sensitive data, but it does provide additional flexibility to administrators, developers, and support personnel on querying sensitive data and maintaining compliance.  In this session we will explore how to set up Dynamic Data Masking for use in production support and for generating production-like test data.
