## Title: Query Store for SQL Server 2019  from zero to an hero  lessons learned from the fields .
## Abstract:
### Query Store is an important and recent feature in SQL Server that provides insight into the details of query execution and how that execution has changed over time. Query Store helps to identify queries that aren’t performing well, or that have regressed in their performance. Query Store provides detailed information and  wait stats that you need to resolve root causes, and it allows you to force the use of a known good execution plan. With SQL Server 2017 and later you can automate the correction of regressions in performance. 

You'll Learn
•	Best  practices in implementing Query Store on production servers
•	Detect and correct regressions in query performance
•	Lower the risk of performance degradation following an upgrade
•	Use tools and techniques to get the most from Query Store
•	Automate regression correction and other uses of Query Store.
This is  a demo session only with minimum theory  lessons from the fields   !
