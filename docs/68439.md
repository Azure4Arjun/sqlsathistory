## Title: Self-Service ETL with Microsoft Power Query in PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Are you trying to quickly extract, transform and load data from multiple data sources for data analysis without going through an extensive ETL development?  In this session, I will introduce you to Microsoft's new self-service ETL tool "Power Query" for PowerBI. I will show you with several example demos, how to source data from various data sources, how you can massage the data and consume the data for your use in the data pipeline. I will introduce you to "M" language that is used in Power Query. I will show you how you can discover and mash data from public data sources with Power Query and model the data very easily. If you would like to do ETL quickly without writing SSIS packages or scripts, Power Query is the way go. Come and attend this session to learn "Power Query" for Power BI and Excel. You will be the data analysis star in your organization.
