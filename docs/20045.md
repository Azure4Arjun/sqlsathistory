## Title: Before You Optimize: Understanding Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### You know what your query does, but do you know how it does it?  Do you know what type of resources your query uses?  Come to this session to find the answers to these questions and more as we walk through reading execution plans.  We will see how SQL breaks down the execution of your query and what each step tells us about the overall query.  If you are newer to Microsoft SQL or you just donâ€™t feel totally comfortable with reading execution plans, this session is for you.
