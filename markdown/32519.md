## Title: Basic Performance Tips and Gotchas
## Abstract:
### Forget Profiler for a second, I have seen one poorly placed index bring an enterprise database to its knees. We will cover the basic tips of performance which always work and the ones which always fail. What can you do – and what should you do –when it comes to the most common types of indexes so you always make the right move. The Author will use lessons from SQL Architecture Joes 2 Pros Vol3.
