## Title: Working with complicated data models in DAX
## Abstract:
### Have you ever watched a demo of DAX functionality, and marvelled at how simple the language is, but yet, when you work on your own data model, it just doesn't work as expected?

In this session, we'll look at 4 common problems which occur when you're using more complicated data modelling techniques, and design and implement a simple solution to overcome these complications. 

From role-playing dimensions and bi-directional filters to advanced filter context and overriding the default blank behaviour, we'll learn to solve a variety of problems and add value to our data models.
