## Title: Accelerating and modernizing data integration with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Integration Services (aka SSIS) has been serving us for years for building enterprise data integration solutions, not only for data warehousing but for all types of data integrations between heterogenous data sources. SSIS is not retiring but it is high time to check out its new neighbor; Azure Data Factory, fully managed ETL service in the cloud. Let me show you how we can use Azure Data Factory for implementing modern data integrations for on-premise and cloud sources with various type of transformations available including Azure services such as Azure Data Lake Analytics, HDInsight and Machine Learning.
