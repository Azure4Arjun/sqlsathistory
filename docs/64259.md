## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for Your Big Data Problems
## Abstract:
### Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, it's time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. 

In this session, you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. You learn how to implement new features added in SQL Server 2014 to improve table partitioning.  Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.
