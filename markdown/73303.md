## Title: XML and JSON, does the DBA need it
## Abstract:
### This session explains internal SQL Server XML processes and demonstrates how XML shredding could help to solve issues, speed up daily performance monitoring and detect problems. The difference between XML and JSON will be demonstrated, with an in-depth look at the SQL Server - JSON integration. During the session, the audience will be provided with plenty of code examples. As a bonus, a lucky winner will receive my most recent book, "XML and JSON Recipes for SQL Server".
