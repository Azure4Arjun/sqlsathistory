## Title: The Fruit Goes Enterprise: Full Stack .NET Development Using Only Mac-Native Tools
## Abstract:
### For years, those of us who wanted to use a Mac and do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM, which negates the relative advantages of using a Mac (notably the battery life).

The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM on our Macs! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database backend while introducing Mac-native tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their Mac counterparts paying particular attention to the differences between SQL Ops Studio and SSMS. I'll also touch on the difference between Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac.
