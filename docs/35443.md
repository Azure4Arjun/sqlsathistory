## Title: Tips, Tricks and Code on Table/Index Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Partitioning is arguably the key feature needed to manage large SQL Server databases. In this presentation I will briefly review the main concepts of partitioning and then will provide information from actual experience in implementing partitioning, including code, tips and lessons learned. It is primarily focused on SQL 2005, but will include a brief discussion of the enhancements in SQL 2008.
