## Title: Moving away from SQL Profiler to use Extended Events
## Abstract:
### This session will guide you with practical tips  tricks to move away from SQL Profiler and use Extended Events instead.
Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 and should be used instead of the SQL Profiler. Still lots of DBA's and DEV's use SQL Profiler nowadays because of the convenience and lack of an Extended Events GUI in SQL 2008. 
Extended events however impose a minimal performance penalty on SQL Server and provides much more detailed tracing.
