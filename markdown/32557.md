## Title: Exploring SQL 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption
## Abstract:
### On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security “silver bullet”. The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

This session will explain the basics of TDE and show detailed performance test results. You will leave with an understanding of what it takes to implement TDE and what the cost will likely be. This is a very valuable new feature that you should know about.
