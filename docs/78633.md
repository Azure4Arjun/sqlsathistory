## Title: Databricks: the new kid in the block
## Abstract:
### Maybe you have heard about Databricks, the new guy in the Analytics neighborhood. Maybe we thought that HDInsight was going to be our friend for a long time, but here it comes a new challenger that offers to be bigger, faster and better. 

In this session we will review the current landscape for big data in Azure and how Databricks fits in this picture, including some demos and scenarios on where and when to use it.
