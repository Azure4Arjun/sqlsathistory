## Title: Using SQL Azure in an SSMS Addin
## Abstract:
### The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena.  We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs.  It doesn’t always have to be full sites deployed to the Cloud, it could also be "hybrid solutions", with a Client tool accessing a Cloud database. That is what will be demonstrated in this talk:  A step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio Addin.  The end result is an Addin in SSMS that uses the SQL Azure Cloud as a common script repository.
