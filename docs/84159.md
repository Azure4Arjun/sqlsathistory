## Speaker: Peter Willmot
## Title: Working with SQL Managed Data Types
## Abstract:
### The Geospatial and Hierarchical managed data types were introduced with SQL 2005 but are sadly seldom used (or understood) by most developers more than a decade later. In this session Peter Willmot will take you on a guided tour of these data types and help you to understand the pros and cons of their inclusion in your database/application design.
