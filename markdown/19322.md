## Title: Custom Prompt Pages for Microsoft Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### When a client migrated from IBM Cognos to SQL Server Reporting Services as their reporting tool, we needed to provide the same functionality and user experience they were getting with the Cognos prompt pages. The standard Reporting Services prompt pages could not meet these requirements, so we developed and implemented a custom prompt page solution, using ASP, JavaScript and jQuery, from which to run the Reporting Services reports. This session will cover how we developed this solution and how it works.
