Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 10:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Mark Van de Wiel
## Title: Transaction Log Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### ACID anyone?

Over time SQL Server management has become more and more automated and wizard-driven. With this automation there is less understanding of the fundamentals of the database, starting with the transaction log.

This session will remind the audience about the function of the transaction log, as well as what does (or doesn't) get written to the transaction log. This session will touch on topics such as SQL Server Replication and the impact it has on the transaction log, as well as the truncation point.

And acronyms such as ACID will be clarified.
