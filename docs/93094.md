## Title: Are you getting the most out of SQL Agent?
## Abstract:
### Do you think of SQL Agent as a simple scheduling tool? I used to but over the years have learned how to get more out of SQL Agent than I once did. In this session I will show you how to use SQL Agent for notifications, how to create jobs that can re-run steps, jobs to restart jobs, jobs that start jobs on other servers along with a few other tricks. To close the session, I will demonstrate a SQL Agent job that can even clean up after itself.
