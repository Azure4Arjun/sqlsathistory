## Title: Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.
