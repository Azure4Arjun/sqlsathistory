## Title: Through the Looking-Glass
## Abstract:
### "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" - When your world is SQL Server, you need a looking-glass to determine server health, diagnosis problems, and tune performance.  In this session will we follow Alice through the looking-glass to determine what she finds in SQLServerLand.  Alice will be using dynamic management views and functions (DMVs) to explore the land behind the looking-glass.  She will find statistics, poorly performing queries, and much more.  Follow Alice and her new friends, as she traverses across SQLServerLand and provides you with snippets of T-SQL code that you can use to explore your own SQLServerLand.
