## Title: Empowering End Users with Report Models
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of Report Builder in Reporting Services 2005, end users were given the tools to create self-service Reporting Services reports quickly and easily. 

In this session we will discuss concepts of the Report Model including Entities, Attributes, Roles and other components. We will discuss organization and security within the Report Model to protect data and create a logical view for the business. Then we will cover the methods for creation of an over an existing database and modify them to support specific needs. Once we deploy the Report Model we will build reports and see how the evolution of the Report Builder has enhanced the self-service reporting experience.
