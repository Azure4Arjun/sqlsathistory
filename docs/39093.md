## Title: Case study on real test data generation for web application
## Abstract:
### While developing a web application, you need to make sure you are testing it under conditions that closely simulate production environment. Without meaningful test data in test environment, it is quite impossible to predict the way the application will behave after the release. During this session, we will talk about how to generate real test data to be used in the test environment.
