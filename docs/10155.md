## Title: SQL Server 2014: A First Look at Whatâ€™s New!
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has announced that our next version of SQL Server will be SQL Server 2014.  SQL Server 2012 had some major upgrades in AlwaysOn Availability Groups, ColumnStore Indexes, and Resource Governor.  SQL 2014 takes those features to the next level and introduces a whole lot more!  Rebuild Indexes and Statistics by Partition?  Yes!  A new Optimizer/Cardinality Estimator that you can choose for your Queries?  Yes!  Hekaton in memory data tables that exist separate to the buffer pool and use HASH indexes instead of B-TREE? YES!  Plus SSD Buffer Pool Extensions, Read-Write ColumnStore Indexes and much more!
