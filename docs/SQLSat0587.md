## Speaker: Guy Glantser
## Title: How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance
## Abstract:
### Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren’t aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
Does your query sometimes run fast and sometimes slow – even when nothing’s changed? Did it happen to you that a stored procedure, which had always been running for less than a second, suddenly started to run for more than 5 seconds consistently – even when nothing had changed?
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing (don’t worry if you don’t know what that means) as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will

# Handling Relationships in DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#587---Sydney-2017)
Event Date: 18-02-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: Handling Relationships in DAX
## Abstract:
### The Tabular model in Power Pivot for Excel, Power BI and SSAS Tabular seems to offer only plain-vanilla one-to-many relationships, based on a single column. In 2015 there was the introduction of many-to-many relationships, yet the model seems somewhat poor when compared with SSAS Multidimensional. In reality, by leveraging the DAX language, you can handle virtually any kind of relationship, no matter how complex they are. In this session we will analyze and solve several scenarios with calculated relationships, virtual relationships, complex many-to-many. The goal of the session is to show how to solve complex scenarios with the aid of the DAX language to build unconventional data models.

### You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.
In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running production database the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.

## Title: Become a Troubleshooting Ninja with PowerBI  SQL Extended Events
## Abstract:
### New to Extended Events? Want to become a ninja in troubleshooting common SQL issues using extended events? This is a demo filled session that will show you how to troubleshoot several common issues in SQL server database engine and identify hotspots as well failures using only extended events. This session will showcase how extended events make scenario based troubleshooting easier using Power BI dashboards and without having to collect disparate sets of diagnostic data, gather memory dumps and comprise on performance. There have been a plethora of Extended Events which have been added to SQL Server recently based on customer feedback which deprecates the need to run profiler in many commonly encountered situations in production environments. This session covers the new enhancements and capabilities available for Extended Events.

## Title: AD 2015. 2 AM. A Disaster just began...
## Abstract:
### 2AM. We sleeping well. And our mobile ringing and ringing. Message: DISASTER! In this session (on slides) we are NOT talk about potential disaster (such BCM); we talk about: What happened NOW? Which tasks should have been finished BEFORE. Is virtual or physical SQL matter? We talk about systems, databases, peoples, encryption, passwords, certificates and users. In this session (on few demos) I'll show which part of our SQL Server Environment are critical and how to be prepared to disaster. In some documents I'll show You how to be BEST prepared.

## Title: Power BI Governance and Enterprise-wide Deployment Options
## Abstract:
### Since release of Power BI many companies have started using it to leverage their data assets to profit from market opportunities. The ease of use and quick time-to-value were main elements to make Power BI a respected tool for every business from small to large enterprise. Many Business Users started using Power BI with minimum / no IT collaboration that started causing concerns especially within larger organisations. Now organisations have become increasingly aware of the need to put a governance and control process in place. 

In this presentation Iman will use his experience in implementing and rolling out Power BI for numerous organisations to share some tips and options for governance and deployment approaches at enterprise level.

# In memory OLTP - what can it do for me?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#587---Sydney-2017)
Event Date: 18-02-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: In memory OLTP - what can it do for me?
## Abstract:
### In Memory OLTP came along in SQL Server 2014 along with several limitations.
It was still really useful – as long as your use case suited the limitations.
SQL Server 2016 removes several of these limitations and widens the use cases of in-memory OLTP.
For example, even if you are not taking advantage of in-memory tables, you can probably leverage performance improvements by replacing traditional table variables and both local and global temporary tables with in memory implementations. Now you’ll be able to say that table variable is truly in memory!
Come along to this session and learn about some of features of in memory OLTP  - or Hekaton as a lot of people refer to this -  and how you may be able to leverage these high performance features in both new and existing applications.
