## Title: SQL Server Analysis Services for the DBA
## Abstract:
### This session is for SQL Server DBAs who support BI developers with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) projects. Join this session to learn what SSAS is, how it stores data, and how/when it queries data from SQL Server. During a demo you will see examples of these queries and learn the extent of the control that BI developers have over the design of such queries. This gives you an overview of both Multidimensional and Tabular modes of SSAS as it relates to interacting with SQL Server.
