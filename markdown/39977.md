## Title: It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session, we’ll discuss why you may need temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal support without a true period data type (since SQL Server doesn’t yet have one), and how to query such a table using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement. We will also discuss and demonstrate bi-temporal design, where both system time and application time are supported.
