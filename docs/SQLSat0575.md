Event Date: 10-12-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: SQL Server 2016: A dive into Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

# Natively Compiled T-SQL: The Fastest T-SQL Ever
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-575)
Event Date: 10-12-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andrew Novick
## Title: Natively Compiled T-SQL: The Fastest T-SQL Ever
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s In-Memory tables are accompanied by Natively Compiled Stored Procedures and Functions that run at amazing speed.  We'll:

•	Review in-memory tables
•	Look at the T-SQL language that can be used in Natively Compiled code
•	Discuss how transaction handling is different due to the use of optimistic concurrency
•	Recompile query plans as needed
•	Take a look at DMVs and extended events
•	Compare natively compiled functions to the alternatives forms

How the speed improvements are achieved is a fascinating topic.  We’ll take a look at the C code that SQL produces and uses as an intermediate step.  Somewhere in the C is the query plan and we will hunt for them.

If you want your application to be more than just fast, consider using Natively Compiled T-SQL.  It can make your database code run really, really fast.

## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Query Optimization Techniques
## Abstract:
### How often have you been told that an application is running quot;too slowquot;?  This statement is the cause of a great deal of investigation, frustration, and dead-ends for database professionals.

The problem won#39;t always be a bad query, but when it is, knowing how to dive in, diagnose its performance, and resolve the situation efficiently will turn a potentially frustrating situation into a fun one!  Using that knowledge in development to prevent future performance issues will improve script quality and application design, while making your future self less burdened by performance emergencies.

This is an opportunity to identify common query mistakes and learn a variety of ways in which we can solve them.  This discussion will include query rewrites, indexing, statistics, database design, monitoring, execution plans, and more!

Demos of poor-performing queries will be provided to illustrate key optimization techniques, design considerations, and the tools you need to fix them.  Fast.

## Speaker: Chris Lumnah
## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
## Abstract:
### Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.

In this session I will give you a tour of enhancements in SSRS 2016 including KPI, mobile  paginated reports. Mobile reports can now be viewed on any device; tablet, smartphone and desktop. I will also show you the newly introduced integration of Power BI views into on-premises SSRS 2016.
