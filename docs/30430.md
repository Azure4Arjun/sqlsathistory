## Title: Sql Server Service Broker - An Overview
## Abstract:
### Service Broker can be used to simplify messaging between applications and assist in asynchronous programming by queuing messages and/or events. This presentation will explain how to use the Service Broker services, discuss its many components and show why youâ€™ll benefit from using it. Several case studies will illustrate an elegant way to maintain data across multiple servers and show how to reduce dependencies between related programs and/or data structures.
