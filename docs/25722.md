## Title: Near Real-Time Data Warehouse Updates with CDC  SSIS
## Abstract:
### If you need to keep a data warehouse up-to-date in near real-time, Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution! If you are looking for a way to setup auditing of database changes, CDC is a solution! CDC has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is configured. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes in a way that can be run quickly and keep your data warehouse up-to-date.
