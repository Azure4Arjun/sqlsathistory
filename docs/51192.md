## Title: Treating Schema Like Code - Database Change Management with Liquibase
## Abstract:
### Over the last few years modern source control systems and continuous integration tools have transformed how application code is developed, tested and deployed but in many cases the way we deploy database changes has not changed at all. It is all too common to hear about teams managing their database with an ad-hoc system of SQL migration scripts manually deployed to various development, testing and production environments. The database supporting your application is arguably just as important as the application code. So why do we treat it differently? 

In this talk I will discuss using the open source tool Liquibase to track, manage and apply database changes throughout every step of your development cycle alongside the application code changes.  You will learn how Liquibase manages database changes, how to keep your schema up to date with your code base and some best practices, tips and tricks to using Liquibase.
