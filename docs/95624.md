## Title: Temporal tables in SQL Server: practical usage scenarios
## Abstract:
### Temporal tables were introduced in SQL Server 2016 as a feature for providing information about the data that was stored at any point in time, rather than just the current record. 
Using temporal tables is it possible to track all the changes occurred to the records, making it easy to "travel into the time" to figure out what has changed, when and why. 
During the session will be discussed some of the most common business scenarios for the introduction of temporal tables. 
All cases are based on real implementation to customers and on the experience gained on the field:  
- Data audit. What has changed and when.
- Point in time analysis. Check the history of changes over the time. 
- Warehouse inventory stock. Review fluctuation for product quantity. 
- Anomaly Detection. Detect anomalies and identify trends. 
- Slowly changing dimension. Query valid data for a specified period of time
- Reproduce financial reports invoices and statements.
