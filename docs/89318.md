## Title: Implementing Key Value Store in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### There are great Key/Value and Key/Document store NOSQL solutions out there. But many times you need one in your relational SQL Server database. This session shows how to implement them in a performant and efficient way. We will explore simple key value pairs, composite keys, how to handle for data retrieval with partial keys or patterns, have a look on how to keep track of changes over time and retrieve historic values.  Handling access will be discussed as well as how to transform the Key Value data into a fact table for easy reporting.
