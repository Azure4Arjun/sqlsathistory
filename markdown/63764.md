## Speaker: Andy Warren
## Title: The DBA Career Path - An Open Discussion
## Abstract:
### Join Andy Warren for an open discussion of the challenges and rewards of being a DBA and what the next step on the career path. Is it managing more and larger databases? Working on life critical systems? Moving into management? Or does our path take us more towards BI, or DevOps? No slides, just a lightly moderated discussion!
