## Title: Advanced Data Visualization with SQL Server Report
## Abstract:
### With the standard SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) engine, you can quickly and easily deliver basic charts. In real-life reporting, however, requirements are much more complex. You need to follow the techniques for enhanced information delivery by applying methods from Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, or Prof. Rolf Hichert, including ways to visualize by corporate identity or work with spatial information. This session focuses on charts, gauges, and maps and will show you advanced techniques that will help you get the most out of SSRS. Weâ€™ll cover tricks and workarounds, tips for building your own charting engine and creating your own maps, and ways to visualize data you never thought possible with Reporting Services.
