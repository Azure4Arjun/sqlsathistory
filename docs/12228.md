## Title: Database Physical File Chemistry for the Non-DBA
## Abstract:
### As a database developer, BI specialist or just getting started DBA... How many times have you simply run out of space in your database?  How much better would your life be if you were able to assess your database available space, recognize space problems BEFORE they occur, and make recommendations to your DBA proactively before you hit the ugly "can't auto-grow" error on Friday at 4:30?

This session will leap frog your understanding of database physical files.  You will be given the tools and knowledge to monitor and assess your physical space so you can recommend corrective steps BEFORE they happen.
