## Title: Demystifying AlwaysOn
## Abstract:
### Microsoft rebranded and upgraded the high availability options for SQL Server 2012. This has caused a flurry of confusion around what features are used in what scenarios. Learn what the prerequisites are for running a Failover Cluster Instance or an Availability Group using AlwaysOn. We will also cover setting up an Availability Group then demonstrate both an automated and manual failover process. Finally, we wrap up with a discussion about using the Listener service and how that needs to be configured for your applications to continue to function on failover.
