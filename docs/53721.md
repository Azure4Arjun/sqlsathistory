## Title: Enabling Advanced Data Preparation Capabilities for Your Business
## Abstract:
### Are your business and data analysts frustrated with the amount of time and effort that takes them to wrangle and massage the data they need for their analysis? Is your IT development team flooded with requests to integrate and deliver data?
Self-Service BI technologies have evolved to include data preparation capabilities and in that space Power BI comes with a rich set of features that often goes unnoticed or underused.

In this session we will explore how Power BI can be used to respond to more advanced data preparation scenarios while requiring no or minimal coding, making it an ideal tool for users such as data and business analysts. We will show how Power BI can be used to reduce time and cost of preparing the data used in analysis and reports, while keeping in check considerations and concerns that we, as IT stakeholders, have when adopting this type of technologies in our organizations.
