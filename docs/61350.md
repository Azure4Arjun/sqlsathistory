## Title: Azure Data Catalog 101
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Catalog is a fully managed cloud service that enables users to discover the data sources they need, and to understand the data sources they find, while helping organizations get more value from their existing investments. Data Catalog provides capabilities that enable any user – from analysts to data scientists to developers – to discover, understand, and consume data sources. Data Catalog includes a crowdsourcing model of metadata and annotations, and allows all users to contribute their knowledge to build a community and culture of data.

This session will provide a 101 introduction to Azure Data Catalog. Included in this session will be creating an Asset in Azure Data Catalog, setting up access control for Assets, amongst the demonstration of features of the product.
