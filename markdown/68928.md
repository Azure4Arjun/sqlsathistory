## Title: Finding more space for your tight environment.
## Abstract:
### If you do not have enough space in your hard disk and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I will use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.
