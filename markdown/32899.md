## Title: SQL Server Internals - how things work?
## Abstract:
### In this session we will go over areas of SQL Server functionality that always raise questions. 
What is SQLOS, scheduler, worker? How does internal scheduling work? How does Resource Governor work? 
How does CPU affinity work in SQL Server? What are the preemptive and non-preemptive waits?
Should we be afraid of SOS_SCHEDULER_YEILD and CXPACKET waits?
