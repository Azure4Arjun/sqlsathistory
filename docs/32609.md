## Abstract:
### This session will cover how to use SQL Trace/Profiler effectively. Topics include converting trace templates into T-SQL scripts, running server side traces (and why you should do so), reading trace files via T-SQL. Demo will include creating a SQL job that detects high CPU utilization and starts and stops a custom SQL trace when CPU utilization crosses a predefined threshold.
