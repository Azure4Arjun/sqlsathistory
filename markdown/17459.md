## Title: The Quest to Find Bad Data With Data Profiling
## Abstract:
### 
The legendary adventurer is on the quest of a lifetime. He's found a database that holds the locations of the world's greatest relics, but there's a problem. No, it's not snakes. The database was written using an ancient format and it may hold incorrect data. Our data archaeologist must find a way move the correct data into SQL Server or risk losing our most important treasures, forever. Luckily, he has an powerful tool, data profiling.
Â 
Data profiling is a way that you can identify bad data, measure inaccurate data, and know for sure that your queries are right. There are many different ways our adventurer can use data profiling. This session will show you what data profiling is and how it can help lead you to fortune and glory.
