## Title: In-Memory Indexes:  Part 2 -- The rest of the story!
## Abstract:
### This session is a continuation of my in-memory table presentation (Part 1) given at 8 SQL Saturdays in 2016 only now concentrating on in-memory indexes.  This session will do an in-depth dive into hash, range, and columnstore indexes in the in-memory environment.  It will be about 30% presentation and 70% demos with emphasis on when and how to apply in-memory indexes for stated environments/scenarios.  
After this session you will
1.	 Understand the three in-memory index types, how to create, and when to apply them for selected scenarios
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables/indexes
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory tables/indexes
