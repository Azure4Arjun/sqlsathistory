## Abstract:
### Beginners are frequently confused by the myriad of options available for date data types and manipulating date and time values. This presentation will review the most common date and time related data types, date formats, and many of the common challenges in manipulating dates and times. Some examples will be finding the first or last day of a month, quarter, year - adding Time and Dates together, finding and expressing the difference between date and date/time values, and when and how to manipulate dates and times using string manipulation techniques.
