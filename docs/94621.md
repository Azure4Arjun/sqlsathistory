## Abstract:
### The field of Artificial Intelligence is evolving very fast and considered as a very complex discipline of computer science. Microsoft has launched cognitive services to promote the concept of AI democratization. Using cognitive services, it is very easy to convert an AI idea into a proof of concept. Later we can use the proof of concept to launch enterprise level scale able AI application. In this session we will talk about all the aspects of AI idea generation to, PoC development. Later how can we launch the PoC as a production graded product using Azure AI services.
