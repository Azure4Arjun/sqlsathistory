## Title: Creating SSRS Reports Efficiently Through Best Practices
## Abstract:
### You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn’t it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you’ll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don’t stop changing once they’re released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn’t it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We’ll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.
