## Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances, yet still don't get all the objects. Even using SSDT, not all objects are exported and live at the server level, above the database. 
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and/or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance or for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Creds, SSIS Packages, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports with a Visual Schedule, a Server Security Checkup , a Hardware Inventory, Linked Servers, Server Triggers and DBMail settings.
