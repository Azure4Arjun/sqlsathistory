## Title: Training a large-scale recommendation engine on SQL server 2019
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will show how to train a recommendation engine on SQL Server 2019 Big Data clusters (BDC) on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) using Python, Spark, and SQL. SQL Server 2019 is the first version that tightly integrates HDFS and Apache Spark with a SQL Server engine.
We will start with an overview of the SQL Server 2019 architecture for Big Data clusters. After a brief introduction to Recommender Systems, we will load product ratings to HDFS and link them to the customer and product data in SQL using Polybase. Then we will explore the dataset using Spark, Python and Data Studio and ultimately create a Training and Validation split. In the next step, we will train the Recommendation engine in Spark and persist the model to HDFS. Every step will be performed within the same SQL Server 2019 BDC cluster showcasing the incredible capabilities of SQL 2019.
On-top, by building on SQL Server 2019 BDC and Kubernetes you can run your cluster locally, on premises, or in the cloud.
