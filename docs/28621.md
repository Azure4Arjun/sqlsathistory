## Title: A Preview of High Availability in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### One of the major focuses of the new major version of SQL Server, SQL Server 2012, is mission critical. There are quite a few changes in this upcoming release, including the new AlwaysOn availability groups feature and some changes to failover clustering. This session will give you a preview of what is coming (including some demo) and talk about how you can start thinking about and preparing for SQL Server 2012 even if it will be awhile before you use it in production.
