## Title: SQL2012 Query  Procedure Call Statistics
## Abstract:
### Did you know that SQL Server keeps track of almost every call you make to the database instance? Do you know what information it collects and more importantly how to use that information effectively? Donâ€™t get this confused with statistics used by the optimizer to generate the query plan. These are the stats gathered during the executions.  In this session we will show you how to identify the query activity on your instance and allow you to make smart decisions on which ones to address first and get the biggest ROI on your precious time. Please note that most of this is applicable to SQL2008 as well.
