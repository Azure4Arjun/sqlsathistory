## Speaker: Joe  Fedak
## Title: Analysis Services Troubleshooting and Optimization
## Abstract:
### You've got SSAS cubes and they work. Now people are using them and everyone's queries are slow. I'll  cover how to see who's using the cubes, what query they're running. Also, what can we do to make the queries run faster and how to stop bad queries that are hogging system resources. Specifically I'll cover the SSAS DMVs, the SSAS Activity Viewer available from CodePlex that uses theses DMVs. Also the aggregation designer that is available as part of the BIDS  project and how it can be used to speed up queries against the cube database.
