## Title: Surviving the Data Avalanche
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server database platform is hosting larger and larger databases.  But the industry term “Very Large Database” (VLDB) is more difficult to define than ever with multi-terabyte database becoming very common.  This session will answer questions like:

-	How do I configure my SQL Server instances to support multi-terabyte databases?
-	What risks and problems do VLDBs pose?
-	How do I overcome issues presented by VLDBs?

Administrating and protecting very large databases is extremely difficult and very hard to learn except through direct experience.  This session helps you learn from the experiences of others so that you can apply their lessons learned and mitigate your risks before you ever experience them.
