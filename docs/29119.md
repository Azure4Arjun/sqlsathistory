## Title: Backups  Recovery In Depth
## Abstract:
### BACKUP and RESTORE are among the most important commands for DBAs, and you don't want to learn them under fire.  In just one hour, we'll take a detailed look at exactly how they work and show options you can't get in Management Studio. We'll also cover why you don't have the same capabilities in all recovery models. Once armed with this knowledge, you'll understand best practices for backup strategies, testing restores, and saving your job.
