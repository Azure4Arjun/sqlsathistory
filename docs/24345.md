## Title: Improving performance and scalability using Fusion ioMemory and Microsoft SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Seen as an increasingly cost effective alternative to disk,  flash storage technologies have allowed for dramatic improvements in performance, workload and scalability; resulting in accelerated business intelligence on far less infrastructure than legacy disk-based solutions. As flash is more readily adopted into enterprise architectures, it is important to understand that not all flash should be considered equal. When striving for consistent, low latency performance, it is critical to recognise  how to implement flash to best serve the needs of the database. Join Fusion-io to understand the benefits of accessing Flash natively, whilst physically placing the flash on the PCI bus, where it is closest to the CPU.
