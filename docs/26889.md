## Title: Not So Basic Backup and Restore
## Abstract:
### You’re taking basic backups and you know how to restore them. Things have been running smoothly in your environment but you want to be confident that you’re equipped with the backup and restore tools, techniques, and options that you’ll need to adapt your strategies as business needs change. You’ve heard about piecemeal restores, filegroup backups, and backing up to multiple files, and now you’re ready to dig into learning more about these topics. In this demo-rich presentation, we’ll review scenarios using these options and you'll gain an understanding of some intermediate and advanced options related to backup performance, corruption detection, and the new SQL Server 2014 hybrid backup scenarios. You'll return to the office inspired to validate your backups and test your restore processes regularly, and you'll have references to great tools the SQL community has shared to help you get started.
