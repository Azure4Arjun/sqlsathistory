## Title: Tools for the DBA Newbie: What I Wish I Had Known Years Ago
## Abstract:
### Are you an DBA newbie looking for tools to improve your product and client experience?

In this session, you’ll be equipped with tools to improve query tuning, indexing tuning, and naming standards. You’ll understand helpful built-in technologies that often go unused, server setup practices, and performance logging. And you’ll hear about the best blogs to follow and where to get help from the community.

I’ve learned all of this gradually, but I’m happy to give you a head start. I’ll share insights that I’ve gained transforming our 18-year old, single-tenant database into a thriving multi-tenant SaaS environment. This talk is intentionally broad, demonstrating how we retooled our database and the wealth of information we discovered along the way.   If you are just starting your SQL Server performance journey, this talk will give you at least one thing to dig into on Monday morning.
