## Title: LIVE SQL Server 2017 LINUX Availability Group build-out!
## Abstract:
### Full LIVE build-out of a 3-node SQL Server 2017 Availability Group, on Linux, using native clustering tools! We'll have some things already prepped due to time constraints, but we'll cover general configuration of the operating system, installing SQL Server, and finish with an controlled failover of SQL Server using native Linux utilities. We'll talk about each step along the way.
