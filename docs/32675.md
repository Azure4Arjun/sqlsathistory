## Title: Olap Security using AS Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### The demand is increasing for analytical data on the web for dashboards and ad-hoc analysis.  Companies are using this data to provide immediate insight into their business.  Data as a service model requires that users can only access the data they have permission to use.  This session discusses a method of using an Analysis Services Stored Procedure to secure both dimensions and measures in SQL Analysis Services based on Security Authentication from either Performance Point, Share Point or via Excel Web Services (MSMDPUMP) layer.  This mechanism can also be extended to provide custom application security to a SSAS cubes.
