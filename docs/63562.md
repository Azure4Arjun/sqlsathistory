## Title: SQL Server and Docker. What, How and Why
## Abstract:
### Docker has come to windows, and also SQL Server is coming to Linux. Can you run SQL Server in Docker? Why would you? In this session I'll show you what Docker is, what you can use it for and what the use case is regarding SQL Server. I'm using SQL Server on Docker for Windows myself in test environments for instance, it turns out to be very usefull in Continuous Integration and database upgrade testing scenarios. We'll discuss production scenarios as well.
