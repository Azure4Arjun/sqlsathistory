## Title: What's new in SQL Server 2012 - from A to Z
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, I'll go through all the new features in SQL Server 2012.  I won't cover any one area heavily - the goal is just to identify (and in some cases, briefly show) as many new features as possible....from the new columnstore index, to T-SQL enhancements, to a greatly iimproved SSIS tool, to a new model for creating analytic databases, and more.   SQL Server 2012 has a large amount of new functionality that helps all sorts of database developers.  After this presentation, I can almost promise you'll be VERY interested in upgrading to SQL Server 2012.
