Event Date: 15-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Bala Narasimhan
## Title: Decouple Database Performance from Database Capacity
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing SQL Server has many benefits, but performance isn't one of them.  Typically, I/O bottlenecks (due to storage) in a virtualized environment lead to poor and unpredictable database performance.  Throwing money at the problem by purchasing more storage hardware is often expensive, disruptive and doesn't quite solve the problem.A better way is to accelerate virtualized SQL Servers by reducing I/O latency with Flash Hypervisor software.In this session, we will discuss:.       Leveraging the virtualization platform to reduce costs and complexity of SQL Server deployments.       The performance challenges of virtualizing SQL Server.       Using Flash Hypervisor software to accelerate I/O and create high-performance SQL Servers.       Real-world results – faster queries, more transactions and shorter processing times

## Speaker: Dan Bulos
## Title: Dimensional Modeling: The Basics  Beyond 
## Abstract:
### Dimensional Modeling (DM) is the de facto standard for the design of databases for BI reporting  analytics.  Regardless of whether a database is a data warehouse used for reporting or an OLAP cube or advanced analytics, DM should be the basis for the data model.  This session will cover the fundamentals of DM along with best practices in designing and implementing the data model.  Additionally, we will cover practical situations that require “breaking the rules” of DM and how to implement solutions to these problems.

# The Last NULL in the Coffin: Missing Data, SQL  the Relational Model
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#276-Silicon-Valley-2014)
Event Date: 15-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Fabian Pascal
## Title: The Last NULL in the Coffin: Missing Data, SQL  the Relational Model
## Abstract:
### Missing data has possibly been the thorniest aspect of database management: without a logically sound yet practical solution, data professionals and users are left between a rock and a hard place. They must either (a) rely on SQL's arbitrary and flawed implementations of three-valued logic (3VL) based on NULLs and risk results that are easy to misinterpret, or wrong in ways hard to discern, or (b) undertake in applications a prohibitively complex, error prone and unreliable burden that belongs in the DBMS.
This presentation outlines a relational (2VL) solution to missing data that is devoid of NULLs and theoretically correct.

## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: What is a Latch, and Why Should I Care?
## Abstract:
### Latching is a necessary function of the database engine. Although latching is a topic is normally presented only in expert-level sessions, a good grasp of the problems excessive latching exposes is important even for novice tuners. This session focuses on the PAGELATCH_* and PAGEIOLATCH_* wait types, explaining what is happening, why it is happening, and how to use the exposed information to tune queries and solve performance problems. If you've seen these wait types in Activity Monitor and wonder what they meant, then this session is for you!

## Speaker: Jarek Kazmierczak
## Title: Faster Insights From Any Data
## Abstract:
### Today’s organizations face growing challenges extracting business value from their data. The need for rapid insight is made more challenging by the expanding volume, complexity, and velocity of data. Traditional approaches to information management fail to harness this “data deluge”. New paradigms for data management and data analytics are emerging. Transformation of data to business insight requires a holistic approach that aligns the right platforms, technologies, and processes to support the decision process and analysis that business demands. During the session, we will the examine the Microsoft’s vision of enabling organizations to manage any data at any scale while empowering business users through self-serve information management and self-serve business intelligence. Through demos and interactive discovery we  will explore how the PowerBI BI tools can be used with Hadoop /HDInsight to accelerate organizations’ journey from data to insight.

## Speaker: Roberto Arnetoli and Andrew Eichenbaum
## Title: An Analytics Sandbox in A World of Big Data  
## Abstract:
### As Big Data becomes the norm to deal with data volume, variety and velocity, it becomes increasingly harder for the Data Analyst to understand and work with data sets.  To overcome this we introduce Platfora, a Hadoop-backed data analysis framework which nicely complements more traditional data warehousing and BI solutions. We'll go over ingestion of new data and building of data sets and visualizations in a system that requires no more work than interacting with a graphical interface. More specifically, we will do so in the context of peer-to-peer lending, to show how insights on loan applicants and their risk profiles can be quickly revealed with no ETL development or demanding data transformation.

## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating your BI Framework
## Abstract:
### Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Title: Hybrid Solutions: The Future of SQL Server Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### The cloud is a polarizing buzzword in IT, especially for DBAs. The reality is that all of us will be affected by it over the next few years in one way or another much like we have been by virtualization. One of the best uses for the cloud is creating disaster recovery easier than we have been able to do in the past. This session will discuss the cloud from a SQL Server DBA perspective and how things like hybrid on premise/cloud solutions can be architected today to bring resiliency to current solutions with features like availability groups in SQL Server 2012 and 2014.

## Title: Migration considerations for In-memory OLTP - What, Why, How and What not
## Abstract:
### In-memory OLTP is probably one of the most radical technologies to hit SQL Server in a long time. It has become the topic of endless discussions, debates, and the unavoidable myths. In this session we will cover the actual pains that drove the design of in-memory OLTP. We will understand WHAT it was created for, WHY it solves challenges that proved to be extremely hard to solve, HOW to find out if it is the right technology for you and not less important, what it was NOT designed for. We will cover a few real stories of applications that have utilized In-Memory OLTP successfully.

## Speaker: Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
## Abstract:
### Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.
