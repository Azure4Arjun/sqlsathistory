## Title: The language of graph databases and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 introduced the extension for graph databases. As there are millions of SQL Server users worldwide, this feature broadens enormously the audience of potential users. 
But, what to expect exactly from a graph database? How to query it? Is SQL Server fully featured compared to other products?
In this session we answer these questions. We start illustrating the concepts behind the model; how relationships are handled and what are the common patterns and issues for a graph. What are the data connections a graph can easily represent.
Then we compare the semantic model with SQL Server to discover how to apply it to real world. We analyze some case study: pattern matching, path finding, aggregation, ranking â€¦ For each of them we show how to use standard T-SQL and how to rewrite the query using graph objects. What is the benefit of reformulate our queries in terms of clearness and performances, what is already available in order to consider SQL Server a valuable player.
