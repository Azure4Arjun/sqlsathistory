## Title: Realizing the Power of Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Once youâ€™ve loaded your data into a star schema and built an Analysis Services 2008 R2 cube around it, you are ready to harness the power of multi-dimensional analysis.  Then, what are your next steps?  You need to decide how to create and display reports, to change your cube design based on your choice of reporting outlet, and determine any additional special considerations.  This session will answer these questions and explore the different reporting options, such as Reporting Services and PerformancePoint Services, when deriving business intelligence from an Analysis Services cube.
