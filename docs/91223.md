## Title: A Primer on SQL Server Clustered Index Architecture
## Abstract:
### How often when creating a new table you just made the Clustered Index using an Integer column with Identity properties.  Seems like that is all I have done for last many years.  But, in the last two years Iâ€™ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios.  In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index.  Results are very interesting and may surprise you.
