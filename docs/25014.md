## Title: Let's cook  'best SQL Server DBA practices'
## Abstract:
### In this session we will go through the topics of performance, scalability and availbility - the 3 core topics that every DBA needs to know. Performance is at the core and required for every database application (small or mission-critical). In this talk we will go through the concepts, tools and procedures that will help you in monitoring and start fine-tuning the performance or find the root-cause on your data platform. The subject covered here is excerpted from my book "Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Administration cookbook" and "SQL Server 2012 Cube Security How-to". This will also be an ideal beginning for any IT person who is willing step-into DBA world.
