# Securing SQL Server Processes with Certificates
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#653-Columbus-2017)
Event Date: 22-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: Securing SQL Server Processes with Certificates
## Abstract:
### What do you do if the DBA won’t let you enable the Trustworthy setting?
 
Things like Trustworthy and cross-database ownership chaining open up huge security threats. Fortunately, there’s a better way.
 
You can secure things like cross-database operations, service broker communication, and high-privileged stored procedure execution with certificates via a process call signing. Additionally things like CLR assemblies that need external access can be executed safely using signed assemblies instead of enabling Trustworthy.
 
This session will cover common processes that can be secured through certificate signing, show how to sign the processes, and cover some basics of certificate management.
 
Note: this session does not cover securing SQL Server connections with SSL or self-signed certificates.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

# Introduction to Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#653-Columbus-2017)
Event Date: 22-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sam Nasr
## Title: Introduction to Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.

## Speaker: Jacquelyn Keeper
## Title: Are You There, DBA? It’s Me, The App Developer
## Abstract:
### Are you a frustrated DBA trying to improve performance on an application you didn’t write? Or perhaps you’re an application developer struggling to understand why your queries run slowly on someone else’s database? This talk will cover practical techniques to help developers and DBAs work together efficiently to troubleshoot poorly performing applications. 

Beginner/Intermediate software developers and DBAs will learn: when you need the actual query execution plan (and how to get it), why queries executed from SSMS perform differently than they do in the application, and how you can improve an application to make database troubleshooting easier. When the DBA and Developer join forces, there’s no problem they can’t solve!

# Answering the question, "What happened?" with Query Store
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#653-Columbus-2017)
Event Date: 22-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Answering the question, "What happened?" with Query Store
## Abstract:
### One of the most anticipated new features in SQL Server 2016 is Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information, namely query plans and runtime statistics. If you've ever had to drop everything to troubleshoot a sudden change in performance, then you've probably already realized the value of this feature. 

In this session, we'll step through how Query Store works - you’ll understand what information it captures and how to access the historical data through the UI and the system views. We'll look at the data collected to identify queries that don't perform well and those that have regressions in performance due to different plans. Finally, we'll see how to force a specific plan for a query, discover what happens when the optimizer cannot use that plan, and examine how plan forcing compares to using plan guides. Expect to learn how to make troubleshooting easier with this feature that’s included in all editions of SQL Server 201

## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?
## Abstract:
### Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.

# DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#653-Columbus-2017)
Event Date: 22-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Bert Wagner
## Title: DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.
