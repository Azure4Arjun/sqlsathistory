## Speaker: Jeff Prom
## Title: Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### As the old adage goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' Stop spending hours manually cleansing your data, and start using DQS! DQS is the new data 
quality tool provided with SQL Server 2012. By leveraging knowledge bases, you can correct invalid data and improve the quality of your data.

In this session we will cover creating a knowledge base, data cleansing, data matching, and using 3rd party knowledge bases (Reference Data). We will talk about installation, show how to use the DQS tool, and how to integrate DQS into your SSIS packages. After this session you should have a good understanding of what DQS is, how to use it, and how to get started with your own Data Quality initiative.
