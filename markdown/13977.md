## Speaker: Etienne Lopes
## Title: Optimizing implementation techniques 
## Abstract:
### This session describes some performance boosters as well as performance killers and some techniques that can lead T-SQL queries, functions and stored procedures to take a few seconds instead of lots of minutes to execute. For instance: - What is best, CTEâ€™s or Temporary Tables? When? - When joining more than two tables (or intermediate result sets), should we still care about the join order? - Did you ever expect to see an Index Seek in your execution plan but what you find is an Index Scan, although you took care of parameter sniffing and your statistics are updated? - Do you care about what isolation level you use? Using real life based demonstrations, this session will provide answers to these and other questions.
