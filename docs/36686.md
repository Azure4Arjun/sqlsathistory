## Title: SQL Server Batch Mode and CPU Architectures
## Abstract:
### This session will explain how modern CPU architectures work, illustrate the nuances of in-memory performance using a simple fact to dimension table join which demonstrates that a larger column store index can outperform a smaller one under certain conditions. How batch mode leverages modern CPUs will be described along with the pressure points batch mode places on the CPU, to help illustrate this tooling will be used which goes to a level deeper than that which anything furnished by Windows or SQL Server can provide.
