## Title: Inside Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### You can probably do a good job in configuring and maintaining transactional replication in your environment. You can get these things done with reasonable quality without knowing how SQL Server does things under the covers. However if you want to take your skills to the next level and troubleshoot complex replication issues, it's crucial to know how transactional replication works internally.

This session will answers questions like; How does the log reader know where to start the scan? How does it add the commands to the Distribution database?

Knowing all these will help you to manage and troubleshoot the replication very effectively. Come lets learn together!
