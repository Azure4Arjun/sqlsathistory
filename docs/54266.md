## Speaker: Tim Warner
## Title: A Real, Live PowerShell Beginner's Tutorial
## Abstract:
### The problem with most PowerShell "beginner's tutorials" is that they almost always go way beyond the basics. In this session we cover the true basics, focusing primarily on only three cmdlets: Get-Command, Get-Help, and Get-Member, in the context of SQL Server.
