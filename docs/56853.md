## Title: Polybase, Didn't that go out with the 70's?
## Abstract:
### "With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   In this session we will discuss how to configure Polybase, best use cases, as well as live demos of the technology.
