## Title: Populating a Data Warehouse with SSIS and Biml Patterns
## Abstract:
### This session will demonstrate how to leverage "Biml powered SSIS Patterns", to rapidly build SSIS packages. The focus of this session will be on populating a data warehouse, however the concepts presented could be applied to any ETL/ETL scenarios. The components used during this session: BimlSnap_v2 (an Open-Source, Biml integrated SQL Server database), and BimlExpress (a Visual Studio Add-in used to generate SSIS package) are both available at no charge. In addition, attendees will receive a 'SQL Server Metadata Manager' solution, along with a fully integrated SSIS Framework.
Attend to see how Biml can revolutionize your SSIS development!
