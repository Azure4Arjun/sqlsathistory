## Title: Consulting Outside the Box: Using Creativity and P
## Abstract:
### Often in the consulting world you encounter individuals whom grasp onto logical ideas and parables like Occam's razor â€œThe simplest explanation for a phenomenon is most likely the correct explanation." However, in the database world, reaching these explanations often require more of an artistic flair of creativity in order to reach a successful answer. 

This presentation will focus on some of the unique ways in which Perpetual Technologies consulting staff have formulated successful solutions in what seemed to be improbable circumstances and how the same principles can help you in your everyday endeavors.
