## Speaker: Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: The BI Power Hour
## Abstract:
### Imagine a world in that end-user can collect data from your data warehouse, from operational databases, flat files, excel files and even external data sources like a web page or a data market. Imagine that those users can cleanse the data by themselves, manage calculations, and refresh the data through a tool they are already familiar with. Imagine that they also can build nice and crisp interactive reports (tables, charts  maps) by just a few mouse clicks or by natural language.
