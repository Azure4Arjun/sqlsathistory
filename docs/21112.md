## Title: Data Mining with Excel 2013
## Abstract:
### In this session I will introduce the data mining capabilities of Excel. We will talk about scenarios for the use of the tools and how to interpret the results. We will cover data preparation with respect to the mining models. We will also discuss the very important issue of "margin of error" and the dangers of misinterpreting and/or misapplication of the tools and results. Attendees can expect to leave with a clear understanding of the available data mining tools along with how and when to use them.
