## Title: Applied Enterprise Semantic Mining
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 debuts a new Semantic Platform (commonly known as the applied task, Semantic Search). This text mining technology leverages the already established Full Text Index, and builds semantic indexes in a two-phase process. This presentation provides a science description and demo for the Enterprise implementation of Tag Index and Document Similarity Index. At present (RC0), the indexes work for 15 languages. Included are strategy tips for how to best leverage the technology along with already-existing Microsoft text mining and data mining.
