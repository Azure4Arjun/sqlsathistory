## Title: 2 Years of Database Unit Testing: Lessons Learned
## Abstract:
### This presentation is based on two years of real life experience with database unit testing.
I will explain in which cases database unit testing is most useful. I will show how we test selects, modifications, and error handling. Also I will demonstrate which common maintenance problems arise when we cover our source code with unit tests and how to deal with them.
