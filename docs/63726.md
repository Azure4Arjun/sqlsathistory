## Title: Inside SQL Server Machine Learning Services: Database Intelligence at Scale
## Abstract:
### You are a DBA of SQL Server deploying or considering SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2017. Your manager says that Data Science is the “new thing” and there are Data Scientists in your company that need your help. SQL Server 2016 introduced a new capability called SQL Server R Services and you need to evaluate whether this feature is something your company can trust to deploy in production for an enterprise environment. SQL Server 2017 expands this feature to include Python and what we now called SQL Server Machine Learning Services. We will explore and understand exactly how SQL Server Machine Learning Services works behind the scenes so you know how to install it, manage it, optimize it, and have confidence to use this in real prediction analytic workloads. We will use demos so you understand all the components and look at a real enterprise customer case study as part of this talk.
