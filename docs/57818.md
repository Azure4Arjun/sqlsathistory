## Speaker: Josh Luedeman
## Title: Azure Automation using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### The cloud is the new great tool in our toolbox. It offers the ability to quickly create and remove IT resources on-demand, at high value. This is a great opportunity for developers and organizations to spin up new solutions and test them without large capital investments. The real value in the cloud comes in to play when you are able to spin up and spin down resources, and their sizes as demanded by the application. Attendees of this session will learn how easy it is to automate creation and alteration of Azure resources from the PowerShell command line, and why that's important. We'll talk through different architecture types for cloud services where this is important.
