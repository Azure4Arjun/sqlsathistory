Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Database Administration 
## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Cleaning House: The Indexing Edition
## Abstract:
### Do you design your database's indexes? Well, have you ever analyzed how those indexes are being used, if at all? And do you know if SQL Server needs other indexes to improve performance? Attend this session and discover how SQL Server tracks actual index usage. We will use this data to identify wasteful, unused,  redundant indexes. Finally, we will dive into the Missing Index DMV and learn how to make proper use of its recommendations. We will spend the second half of this session interactively working through a demo exercise, to reinforce the entire process.
