## Title: DevOps, Dev Data and the GDPR: 5 Solutions
## Abstract:
### It’s an age-old problem: developers want prod data for dev and test purposes.

It helps them to write better code and to test it effectively. Self-service access to usable test-data aligns well with DevOps principles that encourage teams to adopt a shift-left mentality to testing.

Unfortunately, in the age of data breaches and the GDPR it’s simply illegal to give developers access to some types of sensitive production data.

So what do you do?

In this session I’ll talk about the GDPR, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and 5 techniques you can use to provide appropriate data that is as “production-like” as possible (within the legal and technical constraints). I’ll demo these techniques both in raw T-SQL and using some of the Microsoft and third party tools that are available to make the task easier.

After this session you’ll be equipped to discuss the problem with your colleagues in an informed manner and you’ll be able to suggest several solutions and their relative pros and cons.
