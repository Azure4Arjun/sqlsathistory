## Title: Power BI for the Developer
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn how Microsoft Power BI can deliver data insights with Software as a Service (SaaS), and specifically what can be achieved by the developer. You will learn that the new generation of Power BI enables developers to configure real-time dashboard scenarios.

Demonstrations will illustrate how to configure real-time dashboards by pushing data directly to Power BI by using the Power BI REST API, and also by processing data and events by using Azure Stream Analytics.

This session will be of interest to architects, developers and IT implementers looking to understand and evaluate the Power BI capabilities.
