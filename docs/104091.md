## Speaker: Alice Drummond
## Title: Top 10 Power BI Data Storytelling Techniques - An Environmental Story
## Abstract:
### Data is so much more than just a collection of numbers on a page. When shared as a story, we suddenly have the power to connect, engage and inspire people across our organisation to transform data into decisions! Join Alice for an interactive, demo heavy session where she shares her Top 10 Power BI storytelling techniques from a range of case studies across the environmental industry.  Learn how to use bookmarks and buttons for seamless navigation; layouts to frame your reports; embed images, videos and GIFs to create emotional connections; use cross-report drill-through to create linkages; configure decomposition trees and ‘what if’ parameters to facilitate decision making; and how to embed media inside of the Power BI App to effectively share and collaborate on your data story across your own organisation!  Get a sneak peak of the types of stories you can tell in Power BI from Alice's 2 minute video: https://youtu.be/pCUUJ_0FZys
