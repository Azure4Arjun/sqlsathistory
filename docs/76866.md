## Title: Python Machine Learning: Would you survive?
## Abstract:
### Curious about machine learning? 
We will help you get started with machine learning in Python. Python is a powerful open-source programming language that is easy to get started with. 
It is increasingly incorporated into software, such as Azure Machine Learning. 

This session introduces machine learning in Python as well as an overall introduction to the Scikit-learn library. 
Scikit-learn is a library designed to provide access to well-known machine learning algorithms. The library is open source, developed by hundreds of contributors from around the world and used across industry and academia. 

We will show how we use data about the passengers on the Titanic to find out what characterizes the survivors.
