## Title: Agile Database Development and Zero Downtime Deployments
## Abstract:
### Does your database development process match your agile front-end counterparts?
Is SQLServer Data Tools the right tool for an agile deployment methodology?

Join me in a fresh approach that will build deployments designed to be agile from the beginning, and also support the capability for zero down time deployments by supporting multiple states of the application, so database deployments can be made in advance, without breaking the application or requiring an outage.

We will touch on how about 35 different types of DDL changes can be prepared to support transition periods, so deployments can run against a live system with no disruptions to also support the next release of your application.

This approach is a new mindset, but with a few months of planning can be leveraged to turn a deployment from a feared event to showing off your true enterprise level DevOps skills. Some demonstrations will show how ReadyRoll can be used to build migrations that support transition periods.
