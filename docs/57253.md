## Title: Azure SQL Data Warehouse - Massive, Parallel, and in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based massively parallel database platform, based on the concepts that the Analytics Platform System/Parallel Data Warehouse uses for on-premises extreme performance. While it appears at first glance to be a familiar SQL Server environment, Azure SQL Data Warehouse has a few gotchas and design implications that can bite you (and your data warehouse's performance!) if you're not aware of them.  This session will teach you the basic concepts of Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and provide tips and guidance on how to get the most of it.
