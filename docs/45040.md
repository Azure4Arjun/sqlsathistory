## Title: What you're missing out on if you're not using Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### Even if you don’t have a full-fledged Master Data project, there are use cases where SQL Server Master Data Services brings helpful tools to the table. For example, if you have data in Excel that your business wants to manage for compliance and/or wants to integrate, or have a requirement to augment data in a data warehouse dimension (such as adding and maintaining an attribute or grouping that isn’t present in the upstream system), MDS has functionality that can help you solve the problem.

This presentation will outline some of the core MDS functionality and will provide detailed walk-throughs of functionality used to solve business problems using MDS.
