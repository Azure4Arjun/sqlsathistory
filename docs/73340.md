## Title: Deploying SQL Server using Desired State Configuration
## Abstract:
### Automation and configuration management are essential tools in the belt of all IT practitioners.  In this session you'll learn about Microsoft's Desired State Configuration tool, and how you can leverage it to automagically deploy SQL Server in a consistent and repeatable way.  You'll also see how DSC can be used to make changes or correct the dreaded configuration drift.

There will be demos! No death by PowerPoint.
