## Title: Introducing the SSAS 2012 BI Semantic Model, aka Tabular
## Abstract:
### New to SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 is the BI Semantic Model, also known as the Tabular model. In this session you'll learn about the newest way to do analytics in SQL Server. We'll compare and contrast it with the traditional Multidimensional Model, then see how to create your first "cube" using the Tabular mode. Finally we'll look at some of the reporting options for using your new Tabular database, including SSRS, Excel, and PowerView.
