## Title: XML vs JSON - Battle Royale
## Abstract:
### Shiny new touch bar MacBook Pro under one arm, JSON strolls in with a coffee from that new place with the ethically sourced beans. Grizzled XML looks up from an old ThinkPad and grunts, remembering that the stained company mug on the cluttered desk had been empty for some time. JSON was sure to be assigned the new web features while XML would be spending another week on those legacy third party integrations...

SQL Server 2016 brings JSON support, but does that mean XML is old news? Which has more features? Do they matter? Which is faster?

We'll review the many similarities and highlight some important differences between SQL Server 2016's XML and JSON support. You'll leave equipped to make the right choice for your environment.
