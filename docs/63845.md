## Title: Creating an Azure SQL Database Using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database provides an environment to quickly build SQL Server databases.  This allows for testing of new versions and functionality with minimal effort.  PowerShell provides cmdlets that create, configure and deploy an Azure SQL Database quickly and easily.  Additionally, cmdlets exist to tear the environment down once you are done with it,  Join me to learn more about the options available for scripting and automating the build of an Azure SQL Database.
