## Speaker: Tim Chapman
## Title: Index Internals
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what an index actually looks like and performs under the covers? In this talk I'll discuss Index Internals, and how SQL Server creates, maintains, and uses indexes internally for normal operations. Iâ€™ll be discussing topics such as index data structures, query optimization (briefly) and maintaining indexes and statistics.
