## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance.
