## Title: Large Transactional Data Migration: A Sr. DBA Case Study From The Trenches
## Abstract:
### No need to groan anymore when you hear the words "Data Migration"!
I'll show you the Data Migration Script that the Mid Level Developer gave me to start with, and you will be AMAZED at the transformation to the final product!  Walk thru the steps I took for the data migration and the additional database implications moving the data has.  As a Sr. DBA, my code has a special focus on performance and resource utilization throughout the development and implementation process. Participants will learn of the techniques that can make for a smooth data migration, development through testing through production deployment. In additon, some of the gotchas I uncovered as well as their resolutions will be reviewed.  I will share scripts related to table partitioning, indexing, as well as pre and post data migration scripts that partitipants will find easy to implement in their own Data Migrations.
