## Title: How to Budget for a Azure Migration
## Abstract:
### You have heard all about the awesome opportunities that utilizing cloud technology provides and you are sold! Technically, everyone agrees it's the right answer and are ready to get started. However, there is one problem. Your organization needs to understand what its going to cost before approving the project. Understanding the cost to move to Azure and its run rate are questions several companies struggle with and can present a major roadblock for moving forward. Oftentimes it's not because the cost is too high, its simply because they do not know what to expect and budget for. In this session, we will walk through the process of building estimates, creating a Azure budget and discuss the several unique considerations you need to be mindful of such as networking, storage, service dependencies, workload considerations and more. As you explore opportunities to migrate to the cloud, don't let cost be a deterring factor.
