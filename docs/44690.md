## Title: Everyday Extended Events
## Abstract:
### As a DBA or developer, you want to know what is happening inside SQL Server. Extended Events are the modern framework for finding and interpreting SQL Server's actions. In this session, you'll see practical examples to solve everyday problems, such as capturing queries and their resources, measuring wait statistics, tracking I/O for database files, and deadlocks. Many useful features will be shown, such as the depth of events, filtering, and multiple target types!
