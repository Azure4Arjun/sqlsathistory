## Title: The Tricky Part of Doing Tricky Things in your Data Model
## Abstract:
### We've mastered the basics of data modeling and data modeling patterns, but what happens when you or a teammate wants to use this one weird trick to improve on the data model and the resulting database design? Have you just discovered a brilliant new trick that no one else has ever thought of? Or will your new design cost you more, take on more risk and cause all kinds of pain for both IT and your business users?
We'll look at a few tricks that we've seen in our database design review and show you how they work and talk about the trade offs for using them. You'll learn about:

Building a database engine inside your database
Designing before understanding your business model
Dealing with data structures that don't do well in RDBMSs
Optimizing the developer versus the data or the app
Using design patterns that don't reflect modern architectures and tools
â€¦and a lot more
