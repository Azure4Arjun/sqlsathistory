## Title: SQL Server Always On - The Good, The Bad and the Ugly
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Always on architecture was deployed with the SQL Server 2012 Engine.  

This session will review terms for high availability and review our implementation of a 10TB data warehouse.    This is an intermediate session, that will not show all of the details of setup, but will review what worked (the good), some unique features (the bad) and cover a couple of outages (the ugly) along the road to a successful deployment of the Always On architecture.
