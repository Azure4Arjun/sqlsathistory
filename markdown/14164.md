## Title: SQL Server execution plans â€“ hidden and tricky optimizations
## Abstract:
### In this session, I'll present some hidden and tricky optimizations that will help you to "speed-up" your queries. It all begins by looking at the query execution plan and from there, we'll explore the alternatives that were not initially considered by query optimizer and understand what is it doing. If you need to optimize queries in your work, don't miss this session. Also expect to hear about hidden features like batch sort, prefetch, set autopilot and hypothetical indexes.
