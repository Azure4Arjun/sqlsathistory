## Title: Creating Modern Data Platform with Azure Synapse Workspace
## Abstract:
### Azure Synapse Workspace contains a number of tools under the one umbrella.  Learn what the tools are and how they can be used to perform an Extract, Load and Transform (ELT), to create a Data Lake  warehouse, incorporate scalable machine learning with Spark and Databricks, and load data to a traditional warehouse in a Synapse SQL Pool. Learn how to use all of these tools to create a modern data warehouse where you can use data inside and outside of a data warehouse for advanced analysis.
