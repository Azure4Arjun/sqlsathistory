## Speaker: Patrick LeBlanc
## Title: CDC + SSIS = SCD 
## Abstract:
### Building dimensions using the Slowly changing dimension wizard in SSIS is simple and quick. However its performance and flexibility is questionable. Even further, when trying to perform incremental loads of your Dimensions using the aforementioned approach or a custom approach prior to Change Data Captured (CDC) offered certain challenges. In this session Patrick will show you how to utilize CDC and SSIS to incrementally load Type I and Type II dimensions using features that are all native to SQL Server 2008.
