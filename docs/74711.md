## Title: Boost your Tabular Productivity
## Abstract:
### Tabular Editor is an open source alternative that relies only on the Model.bim JSON metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM), thus providing an offline developer experience for Azure and on-premises tabular models. 

Making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" model tree allowing you to maintain Display Folders, Perspectives and Translations. The perfect tool for your tabular models.

Combined with scripting functionality, a Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more, Tabular Editor is a must for every SSAS Tabular developer. The tool is completely free.

Demoing the capabilities of the tool is what is in focus for this session and therefore do not expect many slides. Attendees are assumed to be familiar with Tabular Model development.
