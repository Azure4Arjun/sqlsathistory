## Speaker: Kevin Goff
## Title: Business Intelligence with SharePoint 2010
## Abstract:
### SharePoint 2010 provides many opportunities to render data from business intelligence applications.  In this presentation, I'll show examples of building BI content in SharePoint 2010 using PerformancePoint Services, Excel Services, SSRS, and PowerPivot.  Because I'm covering many applications, I won't be able to cover any one topic too heavily.  But at the end of the presentation, the attendee will see several examples of how BI applications can use SharePoint 2010
