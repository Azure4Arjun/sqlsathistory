## Title: How answers.microsoft.com Overcame the key Challenges of Upgrading to SQL S
## Abstract:
### As part of the company’s “Get Current/Stay Current” initiative, Microsoft’s IT organization planned to upgrade its community website, answers.microsoft.com from Microsoft SQL Server 2008 to Microsoft SQL Server 2014. At the same time, the site adopted virtualization and needed to maintain the zero downtime environment the group had built with mirroring. Given the site spans four data centers across the globe and supports more than 1.7 million visitors a day, Microsoft cannot afford downtime, not even for maintenance. This case study shares best practices for upgrading to SQL Server 2014, highlights the technologies Microsoft considered to enable continuous availability, and details how the site leveraged AlwaysOn without making application changes.
