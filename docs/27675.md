## Title: Deeper into Tabular Models -  M-to-M and the "W"
## Abstract:
### You will need to understand how many-to-many relationships work in tabular models. While different than dimensional models, you can be successful in getting many of the behaviors you will need. Understanding how filters propogate is necessary requisite. We will use a "W" diagram to understand how this occurs in tabular models. Then will will learn how to force filter propogation called cross-filtering. The we will cross-filter conditionally, based on what the user has chosen for filters. If time permits we will also learn how to handle large numbers of fact rows, both in development and production.
