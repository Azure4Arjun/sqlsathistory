## Title: AI for the Masses: The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence in the Microsoft Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### Data is the new gold and companies are producing it in massive amounts. Historically it has been tough for companies to mine the data because of the amount of technical resources and human capital it takes to mine it. Fortunately, Microsoft has added tools and services in its data platform that addresses this problem. 
 
In this session we will take a tour of the Microsoft ecosystem and explore some of these tools and services. We will explore:
 
-  How AI models are easily productionized in the cloud using Azure Machine Learning Services and Azure Databricks
-  How Microsoft brought data science to the database via SQL Server Machine Learning Services
-  How AI can be used to enhance Power BI data models

Come to this information packed session, and you will walk away with ideas of how you can help your company leverage the gold mine of data it is sitting on to gain a competitive advantage.
