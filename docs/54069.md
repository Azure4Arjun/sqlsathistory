## Speaker: Gabi Münster
## Title: Women in Technology – Still a Rarity. Any Ideas? [EN]
## Abstract:
### The proportion of women in the IT sector keeps to be below other occupational areas, even compared to other technical professions. A number of actions to positively influence this situation have been initiated by politics as well as private economy. But is this really enough?
The goal of this session is to provide you with information regarding those activities and concepts. But even more important: We want to get your feedback. How are your experiences as a woman in technology, as a colleague, as an employer…? What are your hopes and expectations? How do you see the role of PASS in this context? Do you have any ideas, proposals, criticism for us?
