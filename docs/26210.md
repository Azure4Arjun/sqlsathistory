## Title: SQL Injection
## Abstract:
### Well, we have all heard about the horror stories of data loss due to SQL Injection and how costly (in many ways) they can be. This in-depth discussion covers various forms of SQL Injection attacks and offers some guidelines on how to avoid them. Lots of code examples in both .NET and TSQL.  Watch me hack a website and retrieve user data in just 3 hits on an unprotected html page!
