## Abstract:
### Join this session to learn about  traditional data mining with the power of Mahout in Hadoop and Azure Machine Learning.
Mahout is a machine learning library, supported in HDinsight. HDInsight is the Microsoft service that brings Apache Hadoop to the cloud, and Mahout is a powerful tool for processing models within HDFS and MapReduce. This session will cover how data mining is implemented in the context of big data and the cloud. 
This session will cover the full data mining cycle: ETL,building, testing, and training data models to visualization, testing, and real-time querying. You will see how to discover patterns and make predictions, classifications, and recommendations to get all the insights from your structured and non-structured big data.
