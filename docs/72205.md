## Title: Successfully Running SQL Server in AWS
## Abstract:
### Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest public cloud hosting provider, with many companies successfully running SQL server on AWS infrastructure, but trying to make sense of the available options can be daunting. In this session, we will explore the options available for running SQL server in AWS, either as a managed service or using dedicated EC2 instances. We will document the different storage options, High Availability strategies, as well as important security and maintenance caveats. We will also cover various licensing approaches  available when running SQL server in AWS.
