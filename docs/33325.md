## Title: Managing the Data Tier Application Lifecycle
## Abstract:
### Introduced with SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio 2010, Data Tier Applications (DACs) help to simplify the development lifecycle of SQL Server database applications. DACs can be integrated into larger Visual Studio application projects and make for a very integration application development lifecycle. In this session, you will learn about DACs and how to use Visual Studio to build SQL Server Data Tier Applications. This session will also discuss creating DACs from existing database structures and will demonstrate how to integrate existing databases into Visual Studio application solutions.
