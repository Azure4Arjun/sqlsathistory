## Title: Aggregations in Power BI: How to unlock the power of big datasets
## Abstract:
### Aggregations are one of the most important optimization methods for managing big datasets in Power BI. Combined with Direct Query storage mode, they allow big datasets to be analyzed efficiently by answering high level analytical queries quickly from memory while sending more detailed queries back to the source database.

In this session, you will learn about the concept of aggregations, different table storage modes in Power BI, different kinds of aggregation tables, how to configure aggregation tables so that they can answer high level user queries, and finally how to use tools such as DAX Studio or Extended Events to determine if the aggregations are actually being used.
