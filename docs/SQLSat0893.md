# Automagic Tuning - SQL Server 2019 and Beyond
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-893)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 09:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Automagic Tuning - SQL Server 2019 and Beyond
## Abstract:
### Identifying and fixing problematic query plans got a lot easier in SQL Server 2016, with the introduction of the Query Store. SQL Server 2019 takes that power a few steps further. Have you ever:

•    Had a query suddenly slow down at 2 AM when you were on call?
•    Seen a query that received a giant memory grant that brought the rest of the work on your server to a screeching halt?
•    Had the optimizer choose the wrong type of join and send your query off to never finish?

Don’t worry, you will still have your job, but the features introduced in SQL Server 2017 will make narrow your focus to the absolute worst queries in your environment. You will also get a sneak preview of what’s coming into future releases of SQL Server in terms of performance.

# Data Science with SQL Server Machine Learning Service: Predictive Experiment
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-893)
Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 09:50:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Dinesh Priyankara
## Title: Data Science with SQL Server Machine Learning Service: Predictive Experiment
## Abstract:
### Making data available for data science was considered as very expensive and it was rare to see data scientist works directly with a database for creating experiments. Main reason could be, widely-used languages for data science were not available within DBMSs and DBMSs were not rich enough for experiments.

Good news is, SQL Server Machine Learning Service is now equipped for data science. Let’s have a look on it and see how we can work on training experiments and predictive experiments. Let me show you;
•	What is Data Science and its processes?
•	What is SQL Server Machine Learning Service?
•	Configuring SQL Server for data science
•	Make a training experiment and predictive experiment using Python within SQL Server
•	Consumed a trained model using TSQL

Join with me and see how useful this with both operational and business intelligence areas.

## Speaker: Jason Aw
## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
## Abstract:
### The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

HA and DR professional Jason Aw with 20 years of experience explains all this and more in

## Speaker: Sandy Winarko
## Title: PaaSport to Paradise: Lifting  Shifting with Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance + Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. You will first learn to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI and extend it with custom components. You will also learn to configure SSIS IR to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection. You can then use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to manage your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. You will next learn to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines, allowing you to chain them with other activities, automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, store secrets in Azure Key Vault, and splice advanced transformations, such as Power Query Source, Data Quality Tasks, etc.
