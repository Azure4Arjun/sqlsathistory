## Title: Overcoming Barriers and Avoiding Mistakes with BI
## Abstract:
### A Dynamic Dialog session: Whether you’re considering implementing business intelligence for the first time, have completed projects in the past (and are perhaps looking at later phases), or are somewhere in between, an investment in this session will likely pay dividends. Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog about common pitfalls or traps that we can encounter in designing and implementing BI. We’ll discuss, as a group, environmental and other challenges we have experienced, and share ways to avoid or minimize them, in our ongoing efforts with BI.
