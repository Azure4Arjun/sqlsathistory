## Title: Data Warehouse Automation - Improving your productivity
## Abstract:
### In this session we will discuss Data Warehouse Automation, how it can improve you productivity as a developer and, 
at the same time, produce a consistent and flexible Data Warehouse that's easy to change. 

In the session we will build a Data Warehouse using a Data Warehouse Automation tool, so you can see the process in action. 

We will also look at EzAPI an alternative to BIML, that you can use to generate SSIS packages. Using EzAPI you can save time by starting with a standard SSIS package as a template, and then modify through code. 

Data Warehouse Automation lets you stay focused on what really matters... producing valuable analytics and reporting for your business users
