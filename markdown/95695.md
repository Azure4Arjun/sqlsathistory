## Title: Azure Machine Learning Service with Python
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning service is  Azure based service with provided on-prem Python SDK, that combines both worlds, cloud and on-prem, and brings data scientists ability to quickly prepare data, train and deploy machine learning models and consume the predictions. 
Azure ML service provides broader usage of cloud and improves the productivity, helps burden the knowledge scarcity, reduces costs and does auto-scaling. Azure ML Service embraces also many open-source python frameworks and packages, such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch and MXnet. 

In this session we will explore many of the service features, the ability to combine on-prem with cloud work (using notebooks), connecting to Kubernetes Service, Databricks and other features.
