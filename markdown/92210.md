## Title: Data Collection and Usage: Illegal or Unethical?
## Abstract:
### Data collection and usage is all around us, it is what we do. But is what we do with the data ethical? Are we collecting and processing biased data?  We will take a look at ethical data collection and usage, what it means to your models and forecasts, and how being aware of possible biases can impact your bottom line. You might be training on extremely biased data and not know it, skewing your forecasts in the wrong direction.
