## Title: SQL Injection: From Website to SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Injection is still one of the biggest reasons various websites and applications get hacked. The solution, as everyone tells us, is simple: Use SQL parameters. But is that enough?
In this session, we'll look at how an attacker would go about using SQL Injection to gain access to your database, see its schema and data, and do nasty stuff to both. Then we'll see how to battle such attacks at the UI front, the middle tier, and the SQL Server back end.
Prerequisites: .Net, C#, T-SQL
