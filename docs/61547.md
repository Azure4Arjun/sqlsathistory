## Title: DBATools.io: A Better Way to Manage SQL With PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Anyone who has attempted to use the SQLPS module knows how lacking it is. Anyone who has attempted to use SMO to do things with SQL Server knows how frustrating and confusing it can be. There is a better way!
The open source DBATools.io project exists to provide a larger (and ever growing) set of commands for DBAs to use to manage, and gather data, from SQL Server.
Download the DBATools.io module and play along as we go through a few of the great commands on offer, and learn how you can contribute to a project working to change the way that you manage your environment.
