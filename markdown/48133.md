## Title: No AlwaysOn? HA/DR for Us Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Inherited an older than dirt SQL box? Can't upgrade? Not everyone can have shiny new Enterprise Edition servers, so what high availability or disaster recovery options are available for us mere mortals? In this course I'll go over the HA/DR options that are available for the different versions of SQL, and I'll even give you a real-world example of using a 'listener' before there were Availability Groups!
