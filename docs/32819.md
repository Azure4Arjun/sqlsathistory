## Title: How SQL saved my Business Intelligence Platform
## Abstract:
### The capabilities of SQL are appreciated by the PASS community, but when the end users express their love for SQL, that is pretty amazing. SQL 2005 actually saved a BI deployment from becoming an utter disaster and flipped it to an enormous success. We will explore the previous data model and how the adaptability of SQL made changes to the front end (changing from standard html output to allowing RIA and Ajax design tools) and extension of user capabilities possible without degrading performance or burdening the developers.
