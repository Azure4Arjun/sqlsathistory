## Speaker: John Tunnicliffe
## Title: DevOps, CI and the Data Warehouse [EN]
## Abstract:
### DevOps and continuous integration provide huge benefits to data warehouse development. However, most BI professionals have little exposure to the tools and techniques involved.  John will be showing how you can use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to build and test your data warehouse code and how to use Octopus Deploy to deploy everything to UAT and production. 

This is a demo heavy session which will introduce you to exactly how powerful DevOps can be in practice and will cover:

* Setting up Visual Studio Team Services to act as your build server 
* How to use Octopus Deploy to deploy your entire data warehouse 
* Developing a build-centric PowerShell script with psake 
* Building and deploying SQL Server Data Tools projects with DAC Publish profiles 
* Writing and running automated unit tests 
* The many problems of automating tabular model deployments
