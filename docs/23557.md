## Title: Creating A Performance Health Repository - using MDW
## Abstract:
### Let's cut to brass tax.  What is the quickest way to create a central performance health repository, where we can continuously collect, upload, store, monitor and report on SQL Server Health of multiple instances?  If you are using SQL 2008 and higher, the short answer is MDW, otherwise known as a management data warehouse.  MDW is a native feature available in SQL Server, "out of the box" - why not use it? In this session, we will take you through the setup, from the wizard and beyond. To creating, configuring, and deploying the MDW in a jiffy, as well as creating custom collections to capture your own desired performance metadata. We'll discuss baselines, trends, and understanding the data. We'll show you the reports as well, and how to expand upon MDW.
