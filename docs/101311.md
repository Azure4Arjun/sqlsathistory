## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Emergency! Are You Ready for Disaster to Strike?
## Abstract:
### Just like pilots who are prepared for disaster recovery through regular practice, we as database administrators need to actually spend time practicing recovering with those backups. Ransomware has made it critical to prepare to rebuild your datacenter at any moment. 

This session will focus on the kinds of situations that can dramatically affect a data center, and how to practice recovery processes to assure business continuity.
