## Title: Build a Simple OLAP Cube from Scratch
## Abstract:
### Many database professionals are familiar with concepts throughout the process of Implementing a Data Warehouse, but how many of us have started from scratch and ultimately created an OLAP Cube? While preparing for Microsoft Certification Exams (Implementing a Data Warehouse), I set about to do exactly that. This presentation will share my experiences along the way focusing on initial Data Warehouse design and final OLAP cube creation in SQL Server Analysis Services.
