## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Baselines first, troubleshooting second
## Abstract:
### “The system is slow.  It was much faster last week!  This is taking forever.”  Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs.  In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns.  We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues.  Tools covered include: PerfMon, PAL, Profiler, ClearTrace, RMLUtils, who_is_active and SQL Server DMVs
