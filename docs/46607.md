## Title: The current state of Powershell DSC for DBAs
## Abstract:
### Powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a declarative configuration management system.
Most DBAs are probably using unattended installs followed by a bunch of post configuration scripts make sure our SQL Server instances are production ready.
We will take a look at how Powershell DSC works, and how this can be used by DBAs to install, configure and manage SQL Servers.
We will try to answer questions like:

How does Powershell DSC work
