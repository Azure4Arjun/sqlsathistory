## Title: Assessing and Planning SQL Database Migrations to Azure
## Abstract:
### Today's enterprise is evolving at a rapid pace by taking advantage of what cloud services can offer.  By leveraging cloud's scalability, companies are re-architecting their data centers while doing cost optimization. 
In this presentation, we will do assess the on-premises environment and determining what workloads and databases are ready to make the move and what can you do to improve their Azure readiness while reducing downtime during the migration. 
Planning and assessment plays a critical role in moving to the cloud. We would see wide range of resources and tools to get assessment completed with ease while identifying workload dependencies with practical tips and tricks focusing on sizing and costs. And finally, we'll assess the SQL instances and identify their readiness for Azure as well. 
By the end of this presentation , you'll be able to confidently identify your on-premises workloads and databases that are Azure-ready, or almost ready.
