## Speaker: Kent Waldrop
## Title: Apply Here
## Abstract:
### MVP Kent Waldrop takes a look at the CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY operators and steps through a number of scenarios where these two operators might be useful.  Topics included include use of the APPLY operators with table functions, substituting inline table functions for scalar functions to improve performance, use of the APPLY operator in conjunction with XML and more.
