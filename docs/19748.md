## Title: Temporal Fact Tables: The Road Less Traveled
## Abstract:
### Snapshot fact tables are a common approach when a point-in-time reference is required. In some cases though, even snapshots are not an option due to the amount of data it will generate.

In this session we will walk through a practical example of when and how to implement temporal fact tables, and how these can be a viable alternative to snapshots in certain situations.
