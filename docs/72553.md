## Title: Database Security in an Insecure World
## Abstract:
### Database security is a hot topic, especially with all the recent breaches of major public companies. We know that behind every application or website somewhere lies a database with sensitive information. We also know that companies are pushing data access to an ever growing number of devices, including tablets, cell phones and smart watches. The Internet of Things (IoT) only heightens security concerns. So how do you protect your databases? What are your options, and what ramifications exist with each option? This presentation will provide a high level summary of prevailing database security options along with their pros and cons. Furthermore, an ideal two factor authentication solution is presented for education and consideration.
