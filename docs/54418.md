## Title: Data Science Track in the Microsoft Professional (Degree) Program [EN]
## Abstract:
### Gain the skills you need to help you get the job you want - and use new, innovative solutions and knowledge services to build up your skills.

When you apply for a job in data science, employers want to know if you can analyze and visualize data with Excel or Power BI and whether you can use R or Python to explore the data. They also want to know that you understand key topics, like statistics and machine learning. 

Use the latest tools to solve real-world data problems
It takes more than knowledge to be effective as a data scientist—technical skills and real-world experience with data are critical. The courses in the Microsoft Professional Program include hands-on labs so you can practice with tools used by data scientists in the field today.

We show you in that session, how you can benefit from this Microsoft Professional Degree Program - Data Science, how we enrich the Microsoft content with additional services and what you can expect from this best-of-breed solution
