## Title: Entity Framework Core - Did your feature got In, Out or Planned?
## Abstract:
### EF Core is the new (.NET Core) version of Entity Framework on which the team have started working from scratch. 

It represents a lightweight and extensible version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.
EF Core supports many database engines (SQLite, MSSQL, Posgre, MySQL, SQL Server Compact, IBM Data Servers and Oracle (soon)).

We'll talk about what's in the v1.0 release, and what is still planned. We'll look into some interesting demos as well (C#).
