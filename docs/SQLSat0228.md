# SQL Internal Storage – P2
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: The Meaning of Life (DBA)
## Speaker: Bruno Basto
## Title: SQL Internal Storage – P2
## Abstract:
### This session describes how SQL Server internally stores table data. Although you can use SQL without understanding the internals of data storage, a deep knowledge of how data is stored will improve the development of efficient applications. This second part of this session explores the basic of metadata that keeps track of index storage and compression.

# StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ...and now for something completely different
## Speaker: Constantin Klein
## Title: StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
## Abstract:
### The number of sensors is growing and growing and brings us closer to the "Internet of things". Applications, that have to process a big amount of data from event streams are a logical consequence. Some developers might have heard from Reactive Extensions (Rx) already, but Microsoft offers with StreamInsight (SI) another comprehensive platform for these scenarios.

In this session you will learn what a great addition for your toolbox StreamInsight is, if you have to develop applications, that have to handle complex events (CEP- Complex Event Processing). See how you can start with this technologie and how easy it is to jump in for .NET developers.

# TraceFlag Fun
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Ministry of funny walks (DEV)
## Speaker: Dave Ballantyne
## Title: TraceFlag Fun
## Abstract:
### SQLServer has many TraceFlags that are, for the most part, used to alter a specific part of functionality of SQLServer and are documented as such.  Many of the more interesting flags, however are undocumented, usage is not guaranteed to work across releases, but none the less can reveal some important insight about the product, your data and your queries.

In this session a selection of flags ( both documented and undocumented ) will be explained and why you would (and would not) want to enable them.

# SharePoint HA and DR
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Dead Parrot (SharePoint)
## Speaker: David McMahon
## Title: SharePoint HA and DR
## Abstract:
### When it comes to SharePoint High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are often merged and confused. In this session we'll take a look at the various HA tools that are available to you  when configuring a SharePoint Farm. We'll look at this from a SQL perspective and from a SharePoint perspective and consider what the implications are when applying patches and deploying customisations to a SharePoint Farm for HA and DR. We'll consider some HA and DR scenarios for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 and take a look at the use of SQL Always On as it relates to SharePoint.

# Advanced Indexing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: The Meaning of Life (DBA)
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Advanced Indexing
## Abstract:
### So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.

# Create Your Own Data Type
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Ministry of funny walks (DEV)
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Create Your Own Data Type
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed a data type that SQL Server simply does not support? So why not add it?
Ever since SQL Server 2005, you can easily create additional data types for use in SQL Server. Using .NET integration, you can define a data type and program all the methods you need to make it behave exactly the way you want it to - both in the database and in your .NET application programs.
This session will show you exactly how to create a CLR user-defined data type, and how to integrate it in your database. Will you be the one who creates the next Big Thing, the data type that puts Spatial and Hierarchyid to shame?

## Speaker: Niko Neugebauer
## Title: DataExplorer - the reason you might not need SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### The DataExplorer plugin for Excel( which is currently in preview) is targeting Excel users and Business Analysts by providing them a homegrown ETL process without any additional Servers. Powered by the flexibility of the "M" language, DataExplorer is capable reaching out for such diverse sources as OData, File System, HDInsight or Facebook, for example. 
Besides providing an accessible interface for the non-IT people, the real potential behind DataExplorer lies in creating customizable functions and processes far beyond any GUI.

## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: From Big Data to secret sauce: power your organisation with PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Big Data is not so much about storing massive amounts of data in a common database. It is also a force of change for the organisation, and it means that we have to consider the collective capabilities of the platform to serve the business: from data source to secret sauce that will help the business to make data-driven decisions to drive the enterprise forward, using familiar tools such as the new Microsoft Power BI tools
 
In this session, we will look at RHadoop, which is a match made in heaven for data scientists. It is a combination of R, the world's favourite free data analysis tool, and Hadoop. In this session, we will look at an example of using RHadoop to analyse Big Data, from data to result.
 
We will also look at evangelising your secret sauce throughout the business, using Microsoft’s new Power BI tools in Office 365: Power View, Power Map and Power Query. Come and see how to make Big Data accessible, relevant and perhaps even fun!

## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: Advanced Data Visualisation with Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### As a report creator and designer, it's your role to make the message of the data come alive for data consumers and decision-makers. This requires a balance between conveying the 'truth' of the data across to the target audience, in addition to making the report look interesting that it will draw people's attentions in the first place.

SSRS is one of the most widely-used Business Intelligence products within the Microsoft stack. Come to this session to pick up some tips and tricks for advanced reporting writing, that is also  in accordance with thinking by Data Visualisation gurus such as Stephen Few and Edward Tufte.

## Title: Data Driven Branding for SSRS
## Abstract:
### Ever had marketing send out that email saying that they are re-branding the company with new colours and fonts, normally not a problem until they mention that the 300+ SSRS reports need to be changed too...

This session will show you how to make use of SSRS project templates, and built in data sets, variable, expressions and a bit of modification to the SSRS database to help make these sorts of requests a simple matter of updating some values in a database. As opposed to pulling the reports out of source control before modifying them and trying to get a deployment scheduled.

## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: The Day After Tomorrow: Why you need to baseline
## Abstract:
### Ensuring peak SQL Server performance isn’t always easy and requires a lot of work on the part of the DBA. To maintain the best-possible performance, you need to make sure you’re monitoring the right things. But how do you know if the figures you’re seeing are good or bad? Baseline comparisons can help, and in this session Richard will show you how to get the most from them. Richard will explain what a baseline is, why and when you need to take one, and how you can create one. You’ll also learn about a number of native Windows and SQL Server tools that will allow you to do just that.

Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Dead Parrot (SharePoint)
## Speaker: Seb Matthews
## Title: Leveraging PowerShell for SharePoint Database Operations
## Abstract:
### PowerShell has become the lifeblood of SharePoint Administrators and it's simplicity, elegance and intuitive nature makes our lives easier, or does it?

Many SharePoint admins suffer from "decisions made by SharePoint" when using both the UI and PowerShell to configure and manage their farms, database operations in particular are often clunky and inefficient due to how SharePoint uses its own stored procedures to manage its databases.

In this session we will look at how SharePoint admins can unleash their DBA-fu via PowerShell to help their SharePoint farm databases run efficiently, optimally and (the big one) FASTER.

If you want to understand how you can utilise PowerShell in SharePoint database scenarios, this session is for you.

## Speaker: Stephen Archbold
## Title: Getting the most from your SAN - File and Filegroup design patterns
## Abstract:
### You’ve been given the task of optimising the File and Filegroup layout to get the most from your storage. Not sure where to start, or thinking you could get a more from your storage with a different design?

Are your SAN guys telling you your storage can process 2 GB/s but you're only seeing 200 MB/s?

This session will dive into how to optimise your File and Filegroup layout strategy to get the most from your I/O Subsytem, including a case study where we took a customer's table scans from 500 MB/s to 1.2 GB/s with only a change in filegroup layout.

Topics covered include:
- Layout for OLTP
- Data Warehousing Fast Track Style
- Data Warehousing on a SAN
- Get data into your SSAS cubes faster (ProcessData)
- Hidden options and “go faster” buttons 
- How to maximise performance in enterprise edition and master read ahead

# Automating Database Restores and Verification with PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#228---Cambridge-2013)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: The Meaning of Life (DBA)
## Speaker: Stuart Moore
## Title: Automating Database Restores and Verification with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### SQL Server makes it simple to automate backups with jobs and maintenance, but doesn't provide a simple method to schedule test restores to prove the backups have worked. Using PowerShell we can write simple scripts that allow us to automate test restores from our SQL backups, and then check that the restored database is valid, consistent and usable. 

This session will introduce you to the basics of restoring simple databases with PowerShell scripts, and then extending this to cope with more complex situations including data file relocation, point in time restores and running DBCC checks against the restored database

## Title: Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy
## Abstract:
### Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.
