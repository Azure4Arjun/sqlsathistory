## Speaker: Frank Gill
## Title: Designing a Restore Strategy
## Abstract:
### Do you back up your databases? If the answer is yes (and I really hope it is), do you test your restores? If a table gets dropped at 1:53PM, can you restore the database to 1:52PM using log backups? Can you use the WITH STANDBY parm to apply log backups to a read-only copy of a database?For the answers to these questions and a whole lot more about database restores, plus some nifty scripts, join me for this presentation.
