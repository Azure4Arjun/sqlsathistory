## Speaker: Kyle Neier
## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks
## Abstract:
### We've all heard these words - but what do they all mean? No - this isn't about getting boats up a hill, small building bricks, or an uncommon hairstyle. In this session we'll identify the most common locks and discuss how to leverage and avoid their use. We'll discuss how these locks can turn into blocks and discuss several techniques that can be employed to insure increase data availability and improve performance. Wrapping up the trio, we'll discuss what deadlocks are and what they are not as we discuss strategies for both detection and remediation of this often misunderstood concept.
