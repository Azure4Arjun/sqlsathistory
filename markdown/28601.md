## Title: Windows Failover Clustering Basics for the DBA
## Abstract:
### While you can see how to deploy a failover cluster in 60 minutes, what a DBA really needs is a solid foundation of Windows to truly be able to understand that implementation and its subsequent administration. This session will demystify the Windows layer of clustering and present it from a DBA focus. Using Windows Server 2008 R2, some of the topics that will be shown are: failover cluster validation and its impact on installing SQL Server, a tour of the new Failover Cluster Manager and how it can be used for administration, using the new cluster logs for troubleshooting, and more.
