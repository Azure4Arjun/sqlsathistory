## Speaker: Kyle Walker
## Title: Taking SSIS to the Next Level
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, Kyle will dig a little deeper into SSIS, and explore some intermediate level developing methods, including package configurations, using the expression language within SSIS, and the commonly overlooked tool, Checkpoints, that can save the developer from having to do restart a time consuming package from the beginning. For each topic, weâ€™ll begin with how the feature works, and then move into the steps one would take to set up Configurations, Expressions, and Checkpoints in a package. Finally, you will see a demonstration of each feature in action from start to finish.
