## Title: Big Data analytics with Microsoft R Server
## Abstract:
### R is the world's most widely-used programming language for data analysis. Despite being the most popular, R suffers from lack of scalability and being slow. 
In this demo heavy session I will introduce you to the fundamentals of Microsoft R Server, it’s native file format XDF (eXternal Data Frame), data analytics and manipulation  functions, as well to scalable machine learning algorithms. 
Don’t miss the opportunity to see how MRS addresses open source R scalability and performance issues.
