## Title: SQL Server 2016: New and improved features in SQL Server Integration Services
## Abstract:
### At last SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) introduces new capabilities so that you can add SSISDB to an AlwaysOn Availability Group; The Incremental Package Deployment feature allows you to deploy one or more packages to an existing or new project without deploying the whole project; Upgrading SSIS projects from previous to the current version, the project-level connection managers will continue to work as usual and the package layout/annotations are retained. In this session we will explore these new/improved features of SSIS to evaluate new benefits.
