## Title: GDPR compliant by design
## Abstract:
### From 25 May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will affect every organisation that processes EU residentsâ€™ personally identifiable information (PII). The GDPR contains requirements that systems and processes must consider compliance with the principles of data protection.
The essence of privacy by design is that privacy in a service or product is taken into account not only at the point of delivery, but from the inception of the product concept.
There is also a requirement that controllers should only collect data necessary to fulfil specific purposes, discarding it when it is no longer required, to protect data subject rights.

This presentation provides a breakdown of the key provisions introduced by the new law, which every organisation must be aware of
