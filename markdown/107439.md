## Title: From Gen1 To Gen2. Recipes for a successful Data Lake migration
## Abstract:
### As Data Lake Gen2 is gaining momentum and the product has now reach a very good functional level (new feature such as log analytics, recursive ACLs, Checksum for files in ADF...), it is time to seriously consider a migration from the proprietary Data Lake Gen1 to the Blob Storage based Data Lake Gen2. In this session we will walkthrough the elements of a successful migration such as:
- assessment for identifying existing connections (ADF, Synapse, HDI, ADB....)
- data lake size
- security migration / ACL concepts
- classification of migration complexity
- migration monitoring
- cost of migration
- stakeholders communication
- project plan
- resources needed
