## Title: Migrating Config and Deployment to SSIS 2012
## Abstract:
### In SQL 2012, SSIS has had its largest facelift since SQL 2005. A raft of new features have been introduced, and the most significant of them from an ETL framework perspective is the new Project Deployment model. This completely redefines how we could architect and deploy our solutions with configurations supporting multiple environments. It also raises some concerns around upgrading/migrating older solutions.This session briefly looks at common approaches for configuration management in SQL 2008R2. The new 2012 deployment and configuration model is then introduced and we look at how to best migrate these legacy configurations over.
