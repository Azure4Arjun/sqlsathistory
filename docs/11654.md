## Title: SSIS Configurations
## Abstract:
### Join us for an in-depth discussion on SSIS Configurations. What are the different types? Can we make it easy to promote our packages from development? The answer is YES, we can! In this session, we'll cover the various configuration methods, configuration tables, and how we can make those same tables dynamic.
