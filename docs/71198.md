## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Working Effectively With Legacy SQL
## Abstract:
### A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.
