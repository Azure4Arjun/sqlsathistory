## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: Breaking into the Azure-PowerBI World
## Abstract:
### How to get started in Azure-PowerBI from a DBA background.
You know SQL.  You probably have SQL installed on your own box; you’re familiar and comfortable with SSMS.  There’s all this talk of Azure.   There’s all this talk of PowerBI.  You're not sure how to start.  You're not sure where you even want to go.  You're not sure why you would use Azure...  You're not quite sure what tools you need, let alone how to tie them together.  That's why you want to come to this session.  I'll start you off with what you know...SSMS, and add tools and connections until you have filled Azure with data from SSMS and then tied Azure to PowerBI.  Along the way we'll highlight key parts of the techniques that tie all these pieces together.  At the end you'll see a PowerBI presentation sourced from Azure that you saw created from your favorite, comfortable tool...SSMS.
This set of knowledge can help you in your career planning, and if nothing else, should help you in creating a technical strategy!
