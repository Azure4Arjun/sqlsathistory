## Title: Power Query
## Abstract:
### Power Query is a core technology of Microsoft Power BI and Excel 2016, and it is also available as a free add-in of Excel 2010 and 2013. You can use it to read
and transform data from different data sources, populating tables in data models or in Excel. In this session, you will see the architecture and the connectors available, spending most of the time in demos and playing with the “M” language, expanding the capabilities
of this tool beyond the capabilities of its user interface.
