## Speaker: Craig Bryden
## Title: Paginated Reporting with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Interactive reporting has changed the way that organisations share and consume information. Users can slice and dice their data in so many ways without needing to ask developers to change the reports. However, most organisations do still need paginated (fixed format) reports as well. 

In this session, Craig will discuss the various options available for implementing paginated reports in the cloud and/or on-premises using Power BI. We will explore this in depth from all angles so that you can come away understanding these options and implications.
