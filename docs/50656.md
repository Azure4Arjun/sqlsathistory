## Title: MSSQL is coming to Linux - Are You Ready?
## Abstract:
### MSSQL is coming to Linux next year.  In this session, I will show you how to access MSSQL from UNIX Operating Systems (Linux, Mac OSX, Cygwin, and others) today.  If you're considering possibly using MSSQL on Linux and want to get started on migrating your application today, this is the session for you.  Yes, you can use MSSQL as your database today for your UNIX application.  I'll also show you how you easily migrate existing MySQL or SQLite databases, popular in the UNIX world, over to MSSQL using Linked Servers and the openquery() call.
