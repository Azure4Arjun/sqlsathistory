## Title: How AI Saved My Great-Grandma's Cookbook
## Abstract:
### True Story... My great-grandmother's cookbook from 1937 was crumbling.  It had her hand-written adjustments to recipes, her own additions, and was a prized possession within our family.  Come learn how I leveraged the open-source JFK Files Project on Microsoft's GitHub (with a few modifications) to turn 150 pages of ancient cookbook into a cool searchable website.  

This session demonstrates how you can use both the built-in and custom AI in Cognitive Search. Cognitive Search ingests your data from almost any data source and enriches it using a set of cognitive skills that extracts knowledge and then lets you explore the data using Azure Search. I'll show you how to use this framework to index and search documents, photos, and hand-written text.  The public GitHub repo is available at:  https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureSearch_JFK_Files
