## Title: Geo Location of Twitter messages in Power BI
## Abstract:
### There are several custom solutions that make Twitter messages analysis possible in Power BI. And with a recent addition of the Campaign/Brand Management for Twitter solution template for Power BI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-templates/brand-management-twitter/) it's getting even less complicated to get into this social media mainstream data exploration.

This solution has several components:
- Logic App passes tweet into an Azure Function
- Azure Function enriches tweet and writes it to Azure SQL
- Azure Function also calls Azure ML experiment running Python script to work out sentiment of tweet
- Power BI imports data into it from Azure SQL and renders pre-defined reports

However, Geo location for twitter messages is not available (if we want to filter them by a particular country). Let's try to explore with live demos if we can customize this Azure solution and add a Country filter to our Power BI reports based on live tweet data.
