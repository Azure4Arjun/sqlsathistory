## Title: The Restore Cookbook
## Abstract:
### How do you restore a database that has lost a file? How do you recover from a lost transaction log? How do you get rid of corruption in the fastest time?

At some point in time, these and other destructive scenarios will happen to your databases. And people will look at you and expect you to react swiftly and confidently.

In this session we will demo these scenarios from disaster to resolution. Because if we are the guardians of our SQL Servers then we should all know these recipes.
