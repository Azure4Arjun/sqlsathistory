## Title: Little and Large - Cubes to Scale
## Abstract:
### In 2018 creating a cube is one of the easier tasks in BI, however what happens when the cube you inherit is so big that it officially becomes the biggest cube in the Midwest, and therefore one of the biggest cubes in the country? This session shows how to handle tabular models of size and scale. It also delves into what assistance and considerations are required when considering moving, or even building, your cubes in Azure.
