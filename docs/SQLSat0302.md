Bryan will even demonstrate how a PowerShell script can automatically navigate web pages doing tasks for you on the internet.  In short, there is nothing PowerShell can't do an if you are a SQL Developer or DBA, you need to be leverage its Power!

# Remove the Linked Server 2 Hop Limitation by Implementing Kerberos
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#302---Albany-2014)

## Speaker: Derek Stanley
## Title: Remove the Linked Server 2 Hop Limitation by Implementing Kerberos
## Abstract:
### Some of us have had to experience SSPI, untrusted domain, for login failed for NT Authority\Anonymous Logon errors can have come to the conclusion that there is a limitation when using windows authentication and linked servers. This is actually a limitation to the authentication method and not the linked servers.

# Statistics and Query Optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#302---Albany-2014)
Event Date: 26-07-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Database Design
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
## Abstract:
### There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
## Abstract:
### Abstract:

Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can’t be handled with a single simple or complex query. TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.

Coverage:

1 – Derived tables.
2 – Local temporary tables.
3 – Global temporary tables.
4 – Table variables.
5 – Common Table Expressions (CTE).
6 – User databases in [tempdb].
7 – Trace Flag 1118.

# DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting

## Speaker: Mark Vaillancourt
## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
## Abstract:
### Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.
