## Speaker: Kevin Hazzard
## Title: The Absolute Beginner's Guide to BIML
## Abstract:
### You've been curious about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (BIML) but you just don't know where to start. In fact, you don't even know enough to be sure that you're really interested in learning more about it. Invest one hour in this session and you'll know for sure if BIML's pattern-based code generation tools can add value to your projects. You'll learn how BIML can emit ETL projects dynamically from metadata. You'll also discover how to create multidimensional cubes in a fraction of the time it normally takes. And while these sound like complex subjects, this session will help you understand how BIML makes traditionally time-consuming and error-prone tasks like these more efficient, predictable and consistent.
