## Title: Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX
## Abstract:
### A large volume of analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. For example, you may need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time.  DAX incorporates many built in time intelligence functions to help make date-time based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very beneficial, they can be misused and give erroneous results. To avoid this, it is imperative that you understand what functions to use and how to use them. 
This session is designed to guide you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to use them.
