# Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 10:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: John Sterrett
## Title: Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning
## Abstract:
### The way you tune your SQL Server workloads are changing.  In the past, you would rely on dynamic management views, execution plan cache, and server-side traces or extend events.  In SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to Columnstore indexes; In SQL 2014 the cardinality estimator got a huge overhaul. With SQL Server 2016 we were given query store to allow us to get more insight into our performance pains and execution plan changes. SQL Server 2017 gave us Automatic Tuning and Adaptive Query Processing to help automate performance improvements. In this session, we will harness the ways you improve performance into the new so you can automate the pain away and spend more time identifying and tuning pain points that cannot be automated.

# “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 10:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
## Abstract:
### Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.

# Working Smarter by Using Window Functions
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Michael Schulte
## Title: Working Smarter by Using Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Do you ever find yourself needing to rank the results of your queries? Maybe you need to calculate averages for specific groups within your data, or maybe you would like to include lag values in your output. These needs and many others can often be satisfied using window functions, a set of functions that can perform multi-row calculations while maintaining all of the original rows of your output.
In this session, you will learn how to use window functions in your queries. You'll also see some typical window function use cases and you'll get to look at some common mistakes people make with window functions so you can avoid them yourself. If you can write a query that uses a simple join, then these functions may be the next tool to add to your repertoire.

# Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?
## Abstract:
### Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.

# Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project
## Abstract:
### There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

# I Want To Go Faster! A Beginner's Guide To Indexing
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Bert Wagner
## Title: I Want To Go Faster! A Beginner's Guide To Indexing
## Abstract:
### You've heard of indexes, and maybe you've even tried creating them.  However, they don't always seem to improve the performance of your queries. How are you supposed to know what columns to include? Should you just build an index for every column in your table? (hint: probably not)

In this session you will learn the basics of how to create performance improving indexes. We'll discuss how to identify when a performance problem is due to a missing or poorly defined index, the different types of indexes available in SQL Server, and how to know when to use each type (as well as what columns to include!).

# Temporal Tables – The New Hotness in Data Auditing
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: John Morehouse
## Title: Temporal Tables – The New Hotness in Data Auditing
## Abstract:
### A common issue database administrators face is data auditing.  Many use triggers, CDC, third-party tools, or roll their own type of auditing tool.  In SQL Server 2016, a new feature called Temporal Tables was introduced and helps to simplify this common need.  In this session, we will take a look at what temporal tables are, how they work and how you can implement them into your environment.

## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
## Abstract:
### Most people don’t know it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually the leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, the whole reason for why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file and log file backups a whole lot more happy, and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.

# SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Drew Furgiuele
## Title: SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.

## Speaker: Monica Rathbun
## Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment.

# Data Profiling or Statistics 201
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-770)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 14:40:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Slava Murygin
## Title: Data Profiling or Statistics 201
## Abstract:
### Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.
