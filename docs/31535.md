## Title: Self Service BI on a Budget
## Abstract:
### Wow BI on a budget...or how a DBA can roll out some of Microsoft's vision of Self Service BI using just SQL EXPRESS. In this session we go from a payroll feed in csv to a SQL 2008 Reporting Services Management Report. This report is utilizing windows login as hidden row level secuity. Finance retains control of access to the payroll information. All this can be set up on SBS 2011
