## Title: How Latch Contention Affects the Performance? Common Scenarios and Workarounds from the Field
## Abstract:
### Latches are lightweight synchronization primitives that are used by the SQL Server engine to guarantee consistency of in-memory structures including; index, data pages and internal structures such as non-leaf pages in a B-Tree. Latch contention occurs when multiple threads concurrently attempt to acquire incompatible latches to the same in-memory structure. In this session, you will learn what SQL Server Latch Contention is and how to diagnose it. The session will also cover the common application designs and access patterns lead to latch contention and what the possible workarounds are.
