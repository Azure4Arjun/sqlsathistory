## Title: SQL Anti-Patterns and when it's Okay to be Bad
## Abstract:
### Did I really do that?  If you didn't, you probably will.  And even if you don't ever, it's a good bet that you will still have to deal with others' legacies of Anti-Patterns.  Decades of practice by thousands of software and database developers around the world have produced a large corpus of recognized best practices,  Anti-Patterns are the antithesis of best practice - they are recognized as approaches to be avoided.  SQL databases including SQL Server are no exception.  A number of SQL Anti-Patterns will be described here, along with better practices and exceptions where the Anti-Pattern may actually be a good answer.   This presentation ought to be a spectator's delight - a chance to slow down and admire the train wrecks of others.  For nothing is as instructive as mistakes or as fun to dissect.
