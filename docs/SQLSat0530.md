## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: DBA 102: Now What
## Abstract:
### Things happened, you got a knock on the head and when you awoke your boss said “congratulations” you are our new DBA, perhaps you came to the role in a more intentional manner or are just DBA curious.  Your environment is running but you are wondering “now what” or “what’s next”.  In this session we will give an overview of a few things that could, perhaps even should be next and give some recommendations as to where you can find more resources on-line and maybe even suggest a few sessions to attend at this very SQL Saturday.  So, what will be covered, recovery strategy (you think I mean backups, I don’t, you’ll see why), a touch on performance tuning with a hint of indexing thrown in, add a pinch of high availability and a smattering of security all of which will give you some idea how to answer “now what”.

# Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-530)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Ryan Wade
## Title: Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?
## Abstract:
### R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft has since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging (ETL) and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the "Wickham stack" which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. The “Wickham stack” includes the ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr packages. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may run into.

# Scalable Application Design with Service Broker
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-530)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Scalable Application Design with Service Broker
## Abstract:
### How your business applications interact directly with the corporate database can dramatically affect how successful you are. One of the biggest issues is performance with large databases. By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates, you can focus performance concerns  where the timeliness is critical. SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently and minimizes conflicts with your critical updates. This session walks you through the steps to get Service Broker running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

# ORMs… can’t live with ‘em, can’t kill ‘em.
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-530)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Aaron King
## Title: ORMs… can’t live with ‘em, can’t kill ‘em.
## Abstract:
### Object-relational mappers enable developers to work with relational databases like Microsoft SQL using the languages they know and love.  Sometimes that means that the developers don’t know the underlying queries and statements being sent to the database.  This doesn’t mean that the developers don’t love SQL.  It just means that they don’t know it yet.

In this session, we’ll look at the latest builds of Microsoft’s Entity Framework and see what programming tools developers use to work with SQL databases.  We’ll also take a look at Sequelize.  Sequelize is an open source ORM written in JavaScript for Node.js.  

We’ll take a look at code first development, advanced querying techniques, connecting to existing databases and migrations.  We’ll also take a look at lazy and eager loading techniques.  We’ll take a look at these two ORM’s from the eyes of the developer and the DBA.

## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Learning and Optimizing the SQL Server Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### SQL Server memory management is one of the most important aspects of a writing T-SQL code. And yet many of us don’t know the fundamentals beyond “SQL Server will take care of that”. In this session, we’ll go deep into the internal behavior of the plan cache. We’ll cover four main problem scenarios within the plan cache, what causes them, and how to fix them, including:

1.	Bloating – scenarios that cause SQL Server to needlessly waste space in the plan cache. 
2.	Suboptimal plans – scenarios where SQL Server can’t help but choose a bad execution plan, usually self-inflicted.
3.	Parameter sniffing – situations in which SQL Server specifically chooses a bad execution plan do to the type of parameters pass into T-SQL code.
4.	Recompiles – situations where SQL Server is unable to completely process a block of T-SQL code without having to recompile it. 

If you don’t know much about SQL Server memory management, especially if you write T-SQL code, then this session is for you! You’ll learn
