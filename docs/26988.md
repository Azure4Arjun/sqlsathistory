## Title: BISM Partitions, Security and Hierarchies
## Abstract:
### PowerPivot took end users a long way towards creating some amazing self-service data models that we are starting to find are very valuable to the business.  Now how do we take these models to the next level and truly allow enterprise access to something that may have just lived in a team site previously?  This is where the new features of Business Intelligence Semantic Models (BISM) come into play.  We will take a BISM model from its baseline roots of a PowerPivot and drive it to the enterprise level showcasing partitioning, security, and hierarchies while explaining how these will come into play in a real world business scenario.
