## Title: SQL Server statistics - quick and dirty deep dive
## Abstract:
### No, this is not going to be a Data Science talk. We will talk on a topic as old as the world itself - SQL Server statistics. Why the engine needs them, how the engine uses them, why should we care and most importantly, how to make our queries run faster by creating the right statistics.
