## Title: Get Faster Queries with Better Statistics Management
## Abstract:
### Statistics are key to the selection of a good execution play. But statistics aren’t perfect, and they often require management over and above what the default SQL Server configurations supply.
In this session we’ll look into why statistics, and specifically the histogram, are so important to good query performance. We’ll see how they’re not perfect, and how that can result in an occasional bad execution plan (slow query). I’ll also present a few methods to resolve those statistics-caused performance issues. Of course there will be plenty of examples.
