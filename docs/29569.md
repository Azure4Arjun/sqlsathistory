## Title: Powerful BI in SharePoint 2010
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence is a fast growing specialization due to the need of large and small corporations to quickly interpret real-time information for decision making.  To meet this growing need, Microsoft has greatly enhanced the Business Intelligence of SharePoint 2010 from MOSS 2007.  In this session, you will be provided with an overview of what is possible with SharePoint 2010, include Status Indicators, Chart Web Parts, Performance Point Services, Excel Services, BI Search and Visio Services.  We will close the session by building a fast and simple BI Dashboard on a SharePoint Intranet Portal.
