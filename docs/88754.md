## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: Effective Indexing
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what makes an index useful? Curious about why the optimizer picks the indexes that it does? Wondered what black magic goes into designing good indexes?

In this session, we'll look at design considerations for rowstore non-clustered indexes. We'll investigate what makes an index useful to SQL Server and what common mistakes make indexes useless. We'll go into the details of how various query predicates interact with indexes and what the primary driver is when designing indexes for any database application.

This session is aimed at people who are relatively new to SQL Server indexing.
