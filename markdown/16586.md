## Title: Reporting in Production: A Hadoop Case Study
## Abstract:
### You've upgraded to better hardware, tuned your queries, and busy seasons is still six months away; you should be resting easy. But reports are running too long, SQL Server is under a heavy load, and you're not sure how you'll keep up with the demands of customers, much less the rest of the business. I've been there before. By moving functionality into Hadoop, I've been able to scale the database bigger and faster than previously possible; small incremental improvements became massive linear improvements and I delivered functionality that was previously thought to be impractical. In this session, I'll cover patterns, strategies, and use cases to increase reporting and analytics performance using Hadoop.
