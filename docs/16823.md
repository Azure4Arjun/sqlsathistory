## Title: Hadoopla - Microsoft and the Hadoop Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### Big Data is the buzz word du jour, and Hadoop (the open source map/reduce framework) is a primary part of the conversation. We'll cover what Hadoop does (and doesn't do) as well as the various other technologies that touch upon it.  We'll also look at what Microsoft is doing with Hadoop, both in the cloud and on-premises and how it's a part of the overall Microsoft BI offering.
