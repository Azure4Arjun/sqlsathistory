## Speaker: Christopher Slater
## Title: IO Whack-a-Mole
## Abstract:
### Disk IO for a virtualized SQL Server database takes a mysterious journey. In this session we will take the mystery out of virtual disk IO. Using common infrastructure tools we will explore the path of a disk IO and share repeatable methods that can be used to quickly identify the cause of a performance bottleneck. Along the way we will explore SQL Server, the Virtual Machine, the hypervisor, virtual switches, physical switches, and the storage.
