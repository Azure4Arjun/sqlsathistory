## Title: Business Continuity  - DRaaS
## Abstract:
### Learn how to enhance application availability in environments where uninterrupted business operation is essential.  There are many possible scenarios to consider, and many products and services available to provide disaster recovery. Scenarios can range from simple bursting to the cloud to maintain service levels, to policy-based traffic steering across Azure regions to a comprehensive active-active failover configuration.

KEMPâ€™s LoadMaster provide some of these capabilities thanks to its built-in load balancing and HA features. It can also form a component of protected application workloads when deployed in conjunction with services protected by Microsoft Site Recovery.
