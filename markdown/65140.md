## Title: Twilight TimeZone: Handling Time in Your App Architecture
## Abstract:
### Join two experts in their fields of SQL and .NET architecture for an informative and thought-provoking talk about handling timezones in your application architecture. You might walk away unsettled by your past date/time storage choices, but you'll be more confident than ever that dealing with Time Zones is disconcerting, rarely straightforward, and often complicated! We'll deep dive into the storage and serialization of date/time information from the worlds of both SQL Server and web/mobile application development, in a joint presentation by Sparkhound principal consultants William Assaf and Steve Schaneville.
