## Title: Why (data) quality matters
## Abstract:
### Poor data quality has a cost. 
Examples of data quality challenges and their impact.
Having correct data is very important to make correct decisions. 
Data quality goes hand in hand with proper data modelling.
Knowledge about use cases and workload is important input to your data modelling. 
Different kinds of compression can be relevant depending on your usage scenario.
Storing data economically also means that data should be easy to use. 
Having focus on deadlines whithout having (data) quality in mind will hit you hard at an later point in time.

Delivering good query performance and reports in time is important to business users,
but how to measure it from their perspective?

And obviously the features you provide should work. 
This is where you benefit from unit testing. (Demo of unit testing with SSDT.)
