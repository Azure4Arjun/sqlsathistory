## Title: xVelocity Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 and SQL 2014
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft introduced a new type of nonclustered index called xVelocity columnstore index in the SQL Server database engine. It is based on VertiPaq in-memory data compression technology. The xVelocity memory optimized columnstore indexes are one of the most significant performance and scalability enhancements in SQL Server 2012, and more in SQL 2014. The xVelocity columnstore indexes speed up the processing time for common data warehousing queries -- particularly in situations where very large quantities of data have to be aggregated and accessed quickly.
