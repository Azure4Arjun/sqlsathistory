## Title: Making Sense of the Power BI Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### Power BI has taken the world by storm since it's release in mid-2015. Since then, Microsoft's cloud analytics offering has matured and grown in scope and complexity. In this session, we'll seek to understand the moving parts of the Power BI ecosystem including Power BI Pro, Premium, Report Server, Embedded, the Common Data Service, and more. By the end of this session the audience should have a firm grasp on the ecosystem and when to use what.
