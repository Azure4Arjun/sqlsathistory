## Title: Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Service Broker is often seen as a black box. Messages go in, and hopefully they come out on the other side.  But when they don't, DBAs typically don’t know where to look. Trying to figure out what’s wrong quickly turns into a guessing game.
It’s not that complicated once you understand how it all works. 
Service Broker is an asynchronous messaging technology built into SQL Server that allows you to scale out your application, replicate data or perform ETL, all while guaranteeing messages are delivered and processed in the right order.   In this session, we'll discuss the basics of the Service Broker architecture, its components, and deployment options.  We will discuss troubleshooting tips and performance best practices to help you deploy a Service Broker solution in your own environment.
