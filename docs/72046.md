## Title: DEA (not what you think) Will Be Your New Best Friend!
## Abstract:
### Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) is Microsoft's new tool to help you collect, replay, and analyze a production workload against several configurations of SQL Server to compare performance. It even provides graphs of queries that performed worse after a change so that you can revisit those before making your change! Microsoft PFE, Jared Karney, will show you how to install, configure, and run this new tool and demonstrate how easy it can make your future upgrades and configuration changes.
