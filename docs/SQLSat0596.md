## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Date Dimension: One Script for All
## Abstract:
### All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most data warehouse designers use one that is provided by tools or create one in Excel. But what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all the calculations and formatting up front so that reports are easier to create. A sample script is provided; it creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse--and it takes only seconds to run!

## Abstract:
### Test automation is one of several key technical enablement practices that allows data warehouse and  business intelligence teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of test practices and automation tools out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Agile analytics practitioner Lynn Winterboer and DW/BI architect Cher Fox will share essential agile test foundations and data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on this important agile practice, including a demo of how this works!

# Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#596---Denver---BI-Edition-2017)

## Speaker: Peter Myers
## Title: Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. So this isn’t about systems that follow explicitly programmed instructions, but rather about systems that find patterns and trends within datasets, and use them to deliver insight and predictions.

In this session, you will learn how an Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with Machine Learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and embedding of predictive insights into applications.

This session has been specifically designed to describe Machine Learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing data professionals taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease by which it can be accomplished.
