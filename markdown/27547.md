## Speaker: Varsham Papikian
## Title: SQL Server Data Tools(SSDT) a.k.a. "Juneau"
## Abstract:
### SSDT is a brand new new integrated environment for database developers. It's based on VS2010 Shell and it will replace 'Database Projects' found in VS2010. Database Developers should be able to perform most, if not all of their work without any need to switch to a different tool. It enables Declarative, Model-Based database development, allows to develop both online/offline, enables local testing and SQL Server version-aware targeting. SSDT also makes it easy to integrate your code with Source Control Systems like TFS. At the beginning of the session I will explain what is declarative, model-based development and why do we need it. Then I will demonstrate the power of SSDT by showing how to use.
