## Speaker: Philip Japikse
## Title: Mocks, Stubs, and Dependency Injection, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### So you aren't writing any code without having tests in placeâ€¦well, except for those tricky things like web services, database calls, and that section of code that no one wants to touch since it's a pile of spaghetti.  I start with a big ball of mud and refactor that using dependency injection, fakes, stubs, and mocks.  I will show you how to use Mocks and Stubs to isolate the system under test and write cleaner, more effective tests.
