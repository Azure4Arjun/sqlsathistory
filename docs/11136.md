## Title: SharePoint Integration with SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### SharePoint is a collaboration, document management, and solution delivery platform built on .NET, SQL Server, and Active Directory. This talk explains how SharePoint uses SQL Server to store content, configuration, and logging data. For databases that are not native to SharePoint, Business Connectivity Services provides a seamless forms over data experience. SharePoint is used extensively for Business Intelligence where it becomes the user interface for Reporting Services, PowerPivot, and Performance Point. We will also look at how SQL Server 2012 affects the SharePoint ecosystem.
