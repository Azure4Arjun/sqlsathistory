## Title: Run Your DBA Morning Checklist with Policy-Based Management
## Abstract:
### A good DBA performs a morning checklist every day, to verify that all the databases and SQL Servers are still in good condition. In larger environments, that checklist can become so time-consuming that you donâ€™t even have time for a coffee! This session demonstrates how to use policy-based management to evaluate your servers. By the end of this session, you will be able to use this Solution to verify your own SQL Server environment in no time--and have plenty of time for your morning coffee!
