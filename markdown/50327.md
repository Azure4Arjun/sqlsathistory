## Title: The Journey from Data to Insight
## Abstract:
### Regardless of the tools and techniques we might employ, the fundamental task of the analyst is to turn data into business-relevant insight. This is not a simple task and not one that is fully under our conscious control.
In this session, we will discuss the our current understanding of how this process works and practices analysts can employ to improve the quantity and quality of insights they produce.
