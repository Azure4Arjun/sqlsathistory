## Title: SQL Server on Linux and Containers changes everything for the better!!
## Abstract:
### When Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 it allowed us to run SQL Server on Linux and native Linux containers. This radical change provides a wider and open platform that data professionals can choose how to deploy and run SQL Server.

This session will demonstrate what on SQL Server for Linux is familiar for the data professional and will also highlight some of the differences. We will look at how containers are a game changer for deploying and managing of SQL Server.

The session will also introduce how the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a scalable and highly available platform for SQL Server within containers.

DEMOs in this session will show how easy it is to install SQL Server on both Linux and containers and how Infrastructure as Code provides a mechanism to automate the installation of SQL Server, deploy databases and perform integration tests.

This session will show you the exciting future of SQL Server and how you can learn about it today.
