## Title: Capturing SQL Server activity with SQL Server Audit
## Abstract:
### In today’s environment, more and more companies are finding that they need to capture the activity on their SQL Server instances. SQL Server Audit is a tool built into SQL Server that is designed to fill that need. With this tool, a DBA can capture nearly any action taken on a SQL Server, even some that cannot be captured by any other method.

In this session, we’ll take a detailed look at the capabilities of SQL Server Audit, how to configure it, and how to use the data it produces. We’ll also look into the areas where SQL Server Audit falls short and how to supplement it with other SQL Server tools to provide a complete auditing solution.
