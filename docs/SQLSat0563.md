#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#563---Dallas-2016)
Event Date: 24-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Stan Geiger
## Title: Polybase and Time Travel (Temporal Tables)
## Abstract:
### "With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   The Temporal Table feature creates all kinds of possibilities for implementing Type 1 and 2 dimensions as well as time based reporting and logical data recovery.  In this session we will take an in depth lock at the features and scenarios for use.   We will also look at some actual demos of the technologies so you can get a feel for the technologies in action."

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Objective SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### “It’s slow! FIX IT!” is not a fun way to walk into the office on a Monday morning. However, putting objective metrics to the subjectivity of ‘slow’ is as much a science as it is art. Performance engineering takes effort well before an issue arises. Collecting the right metrics, trending and comparing against an established baseline, and identifying bottlenecks are all part of the performance process. This interactive session will help the DBA fine-tune their performance tuning approach so that the foundation for long-term proactive performance review is in place. The DBA can then shift the job responsibilities from a reactive response to a more predictive and proactive role.

## Title: Managing MSDB
## Abstract:
### You put a lot of time into managing your databases, but MSDB often flies under the radar or only gets backed up. There are a ton of things that get stored in MSDB, so how are you supposed to know what all those items are? More importantly, how do you manage the data that is getting stored in there and keep it from growing out of control? We will take an in-depth look at all the SQL features that put data in MSDB and the best approach to managing that data.  You will walk away with scripts you can use to automate the grooming of MSDB.

Event Date: 24-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Shaw
## Title: Standardize Your Baseline
## Abstract:
### The concept of baselines have been around for many years, yet all too often they are not executed on a regular basis and don't contain enough information, I believe this is because most DBA's don't have a standard baseline to execute. Baselines can tell you how the server should be performing under normal workloads with the configuration that is currently in place.  

During this session we will look at the kinds of data that you should be collecting while spending the majority of our time reviewing the methods on how this data can be collected, stored, automated and reported on.

These standardized baselines will give you a head start the next time you are looking to upgrade your server to new hardware, recover a server and performance troubleshooting.

## Title: WIT: Start 'em Young - Growing Women in IT
## Abstract:
### Do an internet search on "Women in Technology" and you'll find lots of articles with surveys, graphs and percentages telling you that there are not enough women in technology related fields.  They'll give you just as many reasons why girls don't start in IT or women don't stay in IT.  Is this true? As women in technology, are we wired differently? Was there some lightbulb moment that to put us on the path to innovate with code? Why are you in technology in the first place? From Grace Hopper to that 6th grade girl gaming with people around the globe - while technology has changed and is more accessible, what makes women pursue IT careers hasn't. With opportunities now spanning a wide array of fields and technologies, what does it take to inspire the young girls of today? In this session we will try to cut through a lot of the noise and get down to what drives young girls who grow to be women in technology, how we can encourage them, and not get in their way.

## Speaker: Louis Mangiacapra
## Title: IoT – Particle Photon to Azure and PowerBI integration
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction into integrating the Particle Photon Wi-Fi development kit and Microsoft Azure to analyze, collect, and provide PowerBI reports on IoT data. 

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable publish-subscribe event ingestor that can intake millions of events per second to process and analyze massive amounts of data. Once collected into Event Hubs the data can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or a batching/storage adapters.

The Particle Photon has a simple but very robust development environment. When combined with Microsoft Azure using webhooks it is capable of ingesting millions of events per second using a remotely programmable Particle Photon. 

For this training we will specifically look at publishing data from a Particle Photon (equipped with a Photon Weather Shield) to an Azure Event Hub. Next we will store the data using blog storage, SQL database, and data lake storage to then graphically represent the IoT data in PowerBI.
