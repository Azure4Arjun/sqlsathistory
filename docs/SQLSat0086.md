# SSIShare The Code, Man
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-86)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: James McAuliffe
## Title: SSIShare The Code, Man
## Abstract:
### For many SSIS scenarios, a desired outcome is to implement logic or rules that are already in use in existing enterprise applications.  The only significant difference is that the implementation is done in a bulk data loading scenario.  Many times the logic being applied is complex and multi-step.  Many times enterprises have proprietary rules systems that need consistent application throughout the code base.  We will examine a scenario where complex logic from shared code sources can be applied in SSIS processing.

# Lookup Between The Lines is Data Late Than Never
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-86)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: James McAuliffe
## Title: Lookup Between The Lines is Data Late Than Never
## Abstract:
### Fully cached lookups are GREAT for performance in ETL processing.  These types of lookups use a query to pull a limited data set into the SSIS memory cache.  Then, in processing, a exact match is made on lookup values to provide the match lookup value.   However, what if you need to match on more than on value, or use BETWEEN type lookups?  This is possible, and this session will examine some solutions.  Also, we will talk about making allowances for missing data when running ETL processes, strategies for late arriving dimensions and late arriving facts.

# Do You Know the Data Flow?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-86)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Do You Know the Data Flow?
## Abstract:
### The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.

# Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-86)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks or packages that adhere to a pattern, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Tuning Analysis Services Processing Performance
## Abstract:
### You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.

# Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-86)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
## Abstract:
### So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy. But now you have new requirements that require more advanced data warehouse approaches, like late arriving dimensions, bridge tables, parent child dimensions, and Type 3 or Type 6 slowly changing dimensions (SCD). How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.

## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
## Abstract:
### The paradox of Business Intelligence: it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor. Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us. Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow? In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications). The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :) I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

This session will walk through the basics that every successful candidate should know:  Resume tips, Job search and Interview tips.  Yes, recruiters and hiring managers view your LinkedIn page; but, did you realize they also view your twitter account, your blog, your Facebook and that webpage you designed freshman year in college?  If you are in a job search, considering one or just want to be prepared for one, then this session will be a great opportunity to find out what "they" are really looking for.
