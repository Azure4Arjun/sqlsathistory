## Title: Lifting the lid on SQL Server on Linux
## Abstract:
### In this session, database expert Martin Wild of Quest Software will lift the lid on SQL Server on Linux. He’ll explore the mechanics of deploying SQL Server on Linux, what is and is not in the current Linux build and discuss quirks, insights and observations on setup and configuration. Once the stage is set, Martin will cover tuning and performance on Linux and bring you through some new DMVs for Linux monitoring. He’ll then compare the plans produced on Linux vs. Windows for consistency… or not!
