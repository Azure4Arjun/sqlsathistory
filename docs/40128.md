## Title: Spark SQL and Hadoop - When to leverage in-memory SQL
## Abstract:
### SQL on Hadoop has many variants. These SQL engines strive to make use of the plethora of data engineers already trained in SQL. A new class of tools, like Apache Spark, aims to increase the speed at which those SQL results can be leveraged by providing an in-memory, distributed framework to hold and process data. This introductory talk will walk through the pros and cons, plus look at a few real-world examples that can be solved more efficiently with the Spark engine.
