## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Modern T-SQL for Better Performance
## Abstract:
### Once you learn how to write queries, it’s easy to fall back on the same old patterns. You need to get the job done, and using old techniques is often quicker than learning something new. Over the past decade, Microsoft has released several versions of SQL Server with T-SQL enhancements, and many of these enhancements not only let you write queries easier, the queries also run faster. 

Join this session to learn how this “new” T-SQL functionality can save you time when writing queries that also perform great.

## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
## Abstract:
### Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any areas that may be impacting performance or security. During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. During this session we will cover a number of additional tools that can be used, include the Vulnerability Assessment Tool and a suite of 125 SSRS reports the return key data needed in a manner easier to read and export.

## Title: Surviving the work from home burnout
## Abstract:
### After the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 I began the work from home experience. It was a time of uncertainty in the world and I became the lab rat of working from home. It was the beginning of a trend that will eventually culminate in the norm during this 2020 pandemic.   I had to reinvent myself without a guide and eventually burned-out. My physical and mental health slowly deteriorated until I decided to learn more about the human body and the way energy is processed.  I want to share my experience with others and help them reduce burnout and become highly productive.

## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time. This tool can be used to automate complex processes, facilitate reporting on an unknown number of targets, or perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming to develop.

This is an often misunderstood tool that is underused in areas where it can provide immense value or abused by applications that it was never intended for. Well-written dynamic SQL can solve seemingly impossible problems while being easy to read and understand.

Applications that will be demonstrated include: mapping database relationships, schema searching, generating large volumes of TSQL, and much more. Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it!

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques
## Abstract:
### When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.

Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Frank Gill
## Title: Performance Improvements in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 in November.  The latest version contains several improvements and new features that improve reliability and performance.  First, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Second, metadata for temporary tables can be stored in in-memory tables.  For tempdb-heavy workloads, this removes a bottleneck and provides an improvement to performance.  Finally, SQL Server 2019 supports the use of persistent-memory (PMEM) devices.  PMEM can be used to persist the transaction log buffer, effectively removing LOGWRITE waits.  Join me for this session to learn about these new features in SQL Server 2019 and how they can make your workload run faster.

## Title: SQL Server Security Features
## Abstract:
### SQL Server provides several several security features for developers and architects.  Features such as Dynamic Data Masking (DDM), "Always Encrypted", and Row-Level Security provide an additional level of security natively through the database server.  We'll explore the implementation of these features on the client/server for data in transmission or at rest.  In addition, we'll examine built-in features and custom implementations.

## Title: Building a Security Dashboard for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### If you have a SQL Server, you need to secure it. However, even the most robust security is useless if you're not monitoring it. How else would you know whether something has changed? Or whether something isn't working as expected? And frankly, for monitoring, you need a quick view of the data you've collected. Enter dashboards.

In this session, we'll discuss what information you need to collect from your SQL Servers to effectively monitor security. You'll also see how to build a simple security dashboard for your own use using Power BI.
