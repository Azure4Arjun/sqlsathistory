## Title: Improving your communication and leadership through Toastmasters
## Abstract:
### Since 1924, Toastmasters International has been recognized as the leading organization dedicated to communication and 
leadership skill development. Through its worldwide network of clubs, each week Toastmasters helps more than a quarter 
million men and women of every ethnicity, education level and profession build their competence in communication so they 
can gain the confidence to lead others. 
 
By regularly giving speeches, gaining feedback, leading teams and guiding others to achieve their goals in a supportive 
atmosphere, leaders emerge. They learn to tell their stories. They listen and answer. They plan and lead. They give feedback â€” 
and accept it. They find their path to leadership.

In this session we will demonstrate how a Toastmasters meeting operates, answer your questions about how toastmasters can improve your career and tell you where you can find a club that fits your schedule. Join us and find your path!
