# SQLSaturday #279 - Phoenix 2014
Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Marc Jellinek
## Title: SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services / Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### Tired of seeing your name spelled 27 different ways... all from the same company?  Tired of making the same corrections over and over and over again?  Would it be better if business users could directly correct data and have the corrections recorded and consistently applied?

Surely someone has come up with a solution to these problems?

Come check out how software you likely already own can solve these problems.

This session was originally presented at SQL Saturday 158 in NYC, but has been enhanced with additional content and all filler has been mercilessly cut, folded, spindled and mutilated.
