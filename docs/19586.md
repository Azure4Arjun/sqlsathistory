## Title: Optimizing Bulk Insert Operations
## Abstract:
### Why is the ETL slow?  How come this simple insert takes so long?  What is minimal logging and how can this be achieved?  This session will explore how to improve the performance of bulk insert operations with consideration to database settings, indexes, constraints and trace flag 610.  We will compare performance between different methods of bulk insert and discuss how each can be tuned for better performance.
