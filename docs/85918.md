## Speaker: Radoslav Gatev
## Title: Mission: Reactive Cloud - Azure Event Grid
## Abstract:
### What is IoT without communication? Modern software development without integration? What if we took a step further and turn messages into events?

Join me in this session to see how we can build a reactive cloud using Azure Event Grid which is a serverless model of the publish/subscriber model, built for the cloud. The service reached general availability earlier this year and it can turn out be more powerful than you suspect.
