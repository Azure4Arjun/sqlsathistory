## Title: How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server and Data Access frameworks provide developers a rich set of features that help integrating SQL Server as the system database backend in virtually no time. This simplicity, however, often leads to common database design and code mistakes that introduce severe performance issues later when systems work under the heavy load. 

This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.
