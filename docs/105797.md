## Title: Automated machine learning with Azure AutoML
## Abstract:
### AutomatedML is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem. In this session, we will talk about Automated Machine Leanring process and also will give step by step demo of Azure AutoML.
