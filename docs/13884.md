## Title: Analytical Master Data Management with MDS 2012
## Abstract:
### Recent changes in Business Intelligence have placed greater emphasis on on enabling end-user analytics. While compelling in theory, in practice there are many challenges when creating a foundation that supports end-users analytics. Many of these challenges revolve around making consistent reference (i.e. dimensional) data available to end users. This can be addressed using a Master Data Management solution.

This session session will explore ways that Master Data Services 2012 can be used to support the definition and management of master data used to support analytics (BI) solutions. It will start with a high level overview of MDM and MDS 2012, and finish with a demo of an analytical MDM solution.
