## Abstract:
### How many times have you received data from a 3rd party or from within your own databases that has anomalies in it?  What are the typical steps to clean up the data before it goes into the data warehouse or other systems?  This session will demonstrate Data Quality Services, using both the client interface to define domains and rules, as well as the control included with Integration Services, allowing cleansing to occur within the data flow task.
