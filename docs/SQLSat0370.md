# Understanding Parameter Sniffing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#370-Phoenix-2015)
Event Date: 28-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Achieving Peak Performance from your Virtual SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized by now, but are they running at their absolute peak performance? How can you tell? When properly configured and maintained, a virtualized SQL Server will be at least as fast as the system that it came from, if not better. If not properly configured, silent performance killers can wreck your virtualization experience. This session will give you tips and tricks to maximize performance while giving you talking points so you can convince your infrastructure engineers to design the virtualization stack your way. This session goes deep into the architecture and methodology for squeezing the best possible performance from your virtualized SQL Server, and includes valuable tips on topics such as host-level over-commitment, storage performance, In-memory OLTP, and more!

# Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#370-Phoenix-2015)
Event Date: 28-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.

## Title: Protecting Your Data with Encryption
## Abstract:
### We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.

## Abstract:
### The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.   Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life.

## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: SQL Server Backups and Restores A to Z
## Abstract:
### Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

## Speaker: Lori Edwards
## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
## Abstract:
### For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Title: Powershell - Automating build and deployment in a datawarehouse environment   
## Abstract:
### There are many components which are developed and integrated as part of the large database solution – databases, ETL packages, reports, roles/security, SharePoint presentment, dashboards, etc.  But the solution also needs to be managed in the context of a robust ALM, many physical environments with varying configurations, and many developers contending for resources.  Automated builds are critical to such a solution.  In this session we will examine the techniques used at one company to leverage PowerShell to drive automated processes to build, deploy, and test a solution in their development, testing, and QA environments.  We will see live demos of the tools involved.

## Title: SQL Server Filesystem
## Abstract:
### As part of the SQL Server OS, SQL Server has its own file system built on top of the Windows NTFS.  Understanding how the SQL Server filesystem works and how it interacts with NTFS and storage is critical to SQL Server performance.  This presentation will start with a  brief review of NTFS and then go into depth on the SQL Server filesystem.  It should help you understand:
•         Why is fragmentation bad for performance?
•         Why should I allocate more than one file in a filegroup?
•         Why should I not rely on autogrow to size my SQL files?
•         Why is autoshrink a very bad thing?
•         What should my NTFS allocation unit size be set to?
•         How many files should tempdb have?

## Title: Change Data Capture (CDC) with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.

## Speaker: Tim Hidalgo
## Title: Setting the stage...
## Abstract:
### Making successful deployments consistently is something your executive team wishes could happen.  Sometimes they wish it so hard, that you end up becoming that cowboy that tests everything in production (you know who you are).  Procuring equipment and configuring an environment so that you can have some confidence in your solutions, while not destroying customer data, can be a challenge...especially if you have no plan of attack to hand the people that sign the checks.

In this session we will discuss the need for, the design of, and the way to get a staging environment that can boost your deployment success rate, allow developers to fearlessly code creative solutions, and allow you the DBA to get some sleep knowing they aren't testing in production.

## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works
## Abstract:
### I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.
