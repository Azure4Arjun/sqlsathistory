## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning. Old-School Practical Guide.
## Abstract:
### Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in a process of performance tuning. 

In this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way, we will learn performance tuning practical techniques and solve a bunch of issues in real-time. All this will be done using plain old tools, which are available on your system by default: Profiler, Performance Monitor, SSMS, and DMVs. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.
