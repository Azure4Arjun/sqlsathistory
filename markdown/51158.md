## Title: Data, Statistics, and R Integration with BI...Why you should care!
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of R Services in SQL Server 2016, many professionals and clients are using the buzz words: “Statistical Analysis”, “Statistical Approach”, “Predictive Analytics”, “Open Source R” and many more.  This discussion will cover some key differences between the SQL Server R integration and the open source R tools available.  I will cover how an organization can use basic statistical modeling to optimize business processes and improve turn-around-time.  Finally, I will demonstrate how R can be used to predict future business metrics to help drive business decisions to meet the prediction or avoid the predicted outcome.
