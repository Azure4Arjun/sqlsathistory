## Title: Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal
## Abstract:
### Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this semi-interactive talk, weâ€™ll discuss 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some demos involving scenarios of various data model formats. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"
