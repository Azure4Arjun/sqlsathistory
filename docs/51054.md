## Title: Simple Steps for Starting Your Business
## Abstract:
### Do you dream about starting a business? You’re not alone—millions of Americans share that dream. And yet, not everyone has the courage to get started. But if you’re reading this, you have already taken the first steps toward turning your dream into reality.

Obviously, dreaming alone isn’t enough. You have to do your homework, create a plan and take action. You will have good days and bad ones. But don’t get discouraged. As Walt Disney said, “If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember this whole thing was started by a dream and a mouse.” 

Simple Steps for Starting Your Business is more than just a guide to business ownership. It’s really a blueprint for helping make your dreams a reality.

In this session Bob Breaux from the Baton Rouge SCORE chapter will introduce you to the foundations of starting your own business and give you insight into the resources that are available to you within the state of Louisiana to do so!
