## Title: Accounting Basics for Database Developers
## Abstract:
### Many database developers sooner or later need to consume from or feed data to an accounting application such as the 
General Ledger.  Not being trained as bookkeepers, we may find bookkeeping conventions confusing at best and mystical at 
worst.  When is a credit negative, and a debit positive ?  The subject also has a reputation for being dull.  

But not really understanding the concepts and semantics seriously impedes unit testing, effective communication with the business, and  excessive dependence on business analysts as intermediaries.  We can do better !  This session will focus on demystifying the concepts and terms of basic accounting, facilitating further study if you are so inclined and enabling you to understand the requirements and be proactive in testing.  

The session will conclude with a brief demo showing how SQL Server's Analysis Services directly supports some bookkeeping concepts.
