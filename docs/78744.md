This session introduces the concept of the Lambda Architecture and the alignment to Microsoft Azure Cloud Services for managing high velocity streaming data.  The session will talk to each of the key Azure services that form part of a streaming data pipeline, how they work and demonstrate how a streaming solution can be easily and quickly deployed.  The session will walkthrough several examples of real streaming solutions and provide the relevant knowledge and information on how you can easily build your own streaming data architectures!
