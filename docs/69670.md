## Speaker: Andy Warren
## Title: Database Continuous Delivery
## Abstract:
### Automating your deployments should not be limited to applications.  In this session, learn how to create an automated deployment pipeline that includes your application and database using Redgate’s DLM Automation tools.  You will get instant feedback on your code changes, get the exact script you need for release automation and, when you’re ready, you can deploy to production in confidence.  We will use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services to create a build and release pipeline to deploy your changes to dev, staging, and production environments. [Presenter will be Esteban Garcia]
