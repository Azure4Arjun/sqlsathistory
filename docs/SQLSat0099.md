### Security is a vital part of any business intelligence solution. Unfortunately, creating a solution that presents users only with the information they should see can be a challenge. In this session we’ll look at how the various security pieces come together to make the solution work. We’ll cover configuring Kerberos for securing SSRS, SSAS, and SharePoint; Scripting permissions in SSAS using MDX, Active Directory groups, and SSIS; and finally, configuring SharePoint, PerformancePoint services, and Power Pivot services to access user’s data by passing Windows credentials and/or the use of data sources with execution accounts.

## Abstract:
### With SSRS we can quickly generate reports that can be exported to multiple formats.  What happens when you want to extend your report  with custom code?  Perhaps you need a custom authentication layer, custom access to data requiring .Net code, or you want to extend some of the controls that come out of the box with SSRS.
In this session we will see an example of extending SSRS  to use a .Net library for a data provider allowing us to use a custom .Net business layer for our report.  We will also show an example extension to the SSRS graph control allowing us to make design graphs for SSRS.  Custom code is a great alternative for those considering using toolkits like Nevron or Dundas toolkits to extend their SSRS graphing capabilities
