## Speaker: Kendra Little
## Title: Stay Agile, Stay Sane
## Abstract:
### Agile software development emphasizes continuous deployment and its methods do not directly include long term planning. DBAs must ensure data integrity and have a long term view for application scale, so Agile methods present challenges. Come learn about successful real-world practices iteratively developed in a high transaction internet service environment over the last five years. We have created a flourishing Agile shop while meeting high requirements for uptime, customer response, and data consistency. In this session we’ll cover key habits for success, practices to avoid, how and when to get started, and why Agile development can be a great thing for DBAs. Topics will also include how “Testing in Production” can be a huge benefit.
