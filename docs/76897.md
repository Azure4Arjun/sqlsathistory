## Title: Test and Verify Instances with DbaChecks
## Abstract:
### Once you have systems out in the wild, how do you know that they are configured correctly, and that the backups you are taking are actually valid? DbaChecks is a new Community built PowerShell Module (from the makers of Dbatools) that is designed to test your SQL Servers for various best practices, and help you prevent having a disaster. It also comes with a cool feature to output results to a PowerBI report. Basic knowledge of PowerShell is encouraged, but not required for this session.
