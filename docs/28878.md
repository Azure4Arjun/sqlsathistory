## Title: Understanding (B)locking
## Abstract:
### This session will cover how SQL server uses locking in queries and how that can lead to blocking issues.  The session will provide a detailed view into what happens for each of the different isolation levels available within SQL Server and discuss how each one can affect locking/blocking within the system.  The session will then discuss how to use SQL Server tools such as SQL Profiler, DMVs, and Extended Events to detect and resolve locking/blocking issues within SQL Server.
