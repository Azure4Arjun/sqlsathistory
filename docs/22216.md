## Title: ETL Design Topics - Staging
## Abstract:
### The staging area of the data warehouse is an often under-utilized tool in the ETL developers tool belt.  It can be used to optimize ETL performance while limiting impact on source systems.  It can be used to identify data quality concerns before they hit the target load process.  It can be used as a supplemental repository for unintegrated data.  This discussion will cover several common and some not-so-common patterns in the design and use of stage tables within the ETL process and the audience will come away with new ideas and core concepts to put to immediate use.
