## Speaker: Latish Sehgal
## Title: The .Net Ninja's Toolbelt
## Abstract:
### As developers, we all have our favorite utilities, some used occasionally and then there are others that we refuse to work without. We might not use all of them everyday, but a good developer should know his options when the need arises. In this session, we'll go through the tools, utilities and hacks that can make you much more productive as a .Net developer.
