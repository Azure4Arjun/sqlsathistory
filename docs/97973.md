## Title: An Introduction to Versioning and Branching Database Code in Git
## Abstract:
### You're a developer or DBA who wants to get your database code into source control, but you're not sure how to work with it. Should you use release branches? Feature branches? How do you handle emergency hotfixes? There are quite a few discussions and patterns available online for branching application code, but special considerations apply when it comes to database code. In this session, you'll learn to design the simplest branching strategy that meets the needs of your organization, based on the size of your team and your requirements for release practices. We will discuss multiple popular branching models along with “fit notes” describing the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
