## Title: Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!
