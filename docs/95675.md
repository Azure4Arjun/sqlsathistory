## Title: Is Physical Still An Option for SQL Server Deployments?
## Abstract:
### With the push towards virtualization and the public cloud, are there people still deploying physical SQL Server architectures? The answer is yes. However, the answer should not always be yes.

What do those solutions look like in 2019 since things have evolved quite a bit in the past few years with options like hyperconverged? This session will cover when you may want to consider - and when you probably don't want - physical solutions.
