## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
## Abstract:
### If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, do, it’s not use enough transactions.
 
Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code
 
In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.
