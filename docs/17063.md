## Title: Performance Tuning by Digging into the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### The plan cache in SQL Server 2005 and 2008 has a wealth of information available to assist DBA's in performance tuning. This session will show how to query the plan cache to find plan information and then how to parse the XML plans contained in the cache to identify missing indexes by query, high cost parallel queries with high usage counts, implicit column conversions caused by data type mismatches, and other interesting information about how queries have executed in the system.
