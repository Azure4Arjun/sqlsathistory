## Title: SSIS users:  Turbocharge your ETL with expressor
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) users who are writing too much complex code to transform data, struggling with application performance or having trouble integrating diverse data sources will benefit from learning about the expressor semantic data integration system -- an affordable, enterprise-class alternative to SSIS.  They will learn how American Tower improved the data loading times for its data warehouse and enabled its developers to perform complex data transformations in a single process by migrating from Microsoft SSIS to expressor.
