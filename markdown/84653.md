## Title: Establishing a SLA form
## Abstract:
### Most rookie DBA's do not establish a Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point later something goes wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA and communicate it to the rest of the comapany
