## Speaker: Zach Mattson
## Title: Powershell Eye for the Monitoring Guy.
## Abstract:
### Server monitoring can be expensive and is generally licensed for only critical production servers. In this session, learn how to utilize Powershell along with some SMO to not only be proactive, but productive in monitoring the servers in your environment. Attendees will come away from the session with an understanding of how to read the SQL and Server event logs, check backups, find which servers have pending reboots and more. In order to get the most out of this session, it is suggested that those attending have a basic knowledge of Powershell or another administrative scripting language.
