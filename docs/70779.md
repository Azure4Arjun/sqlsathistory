## Title: Troubleshooting Always On Availability Group Failovers
## Abstract:
### Unexpected failovers or Unsuccessful failovers are by far the most common problem sorrunding Always On Availability Groups. Troubleshooting failover related issues can be a challenge and time consuming. In order to effectively troubleshooting these issues data needs to be collected and analyzed from different servers and replicas. Things get further complicated by the fact that there are multiple logs which needs to be looked at and that these logs are in different time zone formats. In this session we will look at how to easily identify the reasons for failover of an Availability Group and what new capabilities are being introduced to help with the analysis of AG failovers.
