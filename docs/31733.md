## Title: Fixing SQL Server–Complete Mess 2 Smooth Operation
## Abstract:
### You’ve either been there or have walked into one and I certainly hope it isn’t your current environment.  There are SQL Server environments which quite simply do not work.  The business doesn’t trust the data, people are running around playing whack-a-mole, everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else, and the tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  When everything is failing, how do you figure out where to start so that you can build a foundation to work from?  How do you then build on that foundation to systematically fix all of the problems while still being home for dinner every night?  Join us for this real world look at “you’re the DBA, you own it, and you fix it”.
