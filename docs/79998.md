## Title: SQL Server 2016 (SP1)  2017 ROCKS!!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 SP1 is probably one of the top 3 announcements for SQL Server ... EVER!! Many previously Enterprise Edition only features were opened up to lower SKUs, including SQL Express! Memory usage scenarios changed DRASTICALLY too! And SQL 2016 itself "Just Runs Faster"!  This session will be a medium-to-high-level overview of these absolutely incredible changes.  We will also talk about some of the awesomesauce released in SQL Server 2017 too! If you are like most entities and NOT on SQL Server Enterprise Edition you WILL want to be on SQL 2016 SP1 or 2017 after hearing this talk!
