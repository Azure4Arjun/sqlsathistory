Event Date: 08-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Solving Complex Problems with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### New to SQL Server 2008, Extended Events provide a refreshingly new method of looking at what occurs inside of SQL Server.  This session will show you how to leverage Extended Events to solve complex problems by identifying the root cause faster than other methods of data collection provide.

# Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-202)
Event Date: 08-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Joe Sack
## Title: Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues
## Abstract:
### When the query optimizer inaccurately estimates the number of rows for query execution plan iterators, performance can suffer due to the generation and use of a suboptimal plan. Fixing cardinality estimate issues will help the query optimizer generate a higher quality plan. This session will teach you how to identify cardinality estimate issues in your query execution plan and also cover various ways in which cardinality estimate issues can be addressed.

## Speaker: James Rowland-Jones
## Title: Thinking Big  Understanding PDW
## Abstract:
### Do you design and build Data Warehouses? Are you interested in learning about big data design challenges and how you can avoid them? Would you like to know more about Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW), MPP Architectures and Microsoft's Big Data Platform? If so then this is the session for you.

We will visit the architectural components of PDW and look at some of the new features available in V2. We will also dive into some of the lessons learned developing systems for PDW in the field.

You will leave this session understanding why you should be thinking about PDW for your data warehouse and how you can accelerate the delivery of your PDW project.

# SQL Azure from Plan, to Backup, to Cloud 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-202)
Event Date: 08-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Tobias Koprowski
## Title: SQL Azure from Plan, to Backup, to Cloud 
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released SQL Azure more than two years ago - that's enough time for testing (I hope!). So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually, restoring with Red Gate Cloud Services. In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionality, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Speaker: Oliver Engels
## Title: Data Explorer - The future of selfservice ETL
## Abstract:
### Data Explorer is an Information Worker focused ETL Tool integrated in Excel 2013. We will show this cool new tool to mash up data from different data sources (from Facebook to ODATA, from SQL Server to Files in a table). We will show in many live demos transformations and will go into the formular engine and possibilities for using it with PowerPivot and PowerView as an output.

# Hadoop for the Business Intelligence Professional
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-202)
Event Date: 08-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Hadoop for the Business Intelligence Professional
## Abstract:
### Microsoft have teamed with HortonWorks to provide their own distribution of Hadoop running on both Windows Server as well as Azure.  This shows a real intention on looking to Big Data. Being able to store huge amounts of data is no good if you do not have the tools to get the information back out.  Luckily Microsoft have those tools in PV and PP. This session will be broken into 2.  Allan will set the scene with Hadoop and give us a tour of what is on offer and quickly how to look at the data.  Jen will then follow this up and really drive some business benefits from the data stored in Hadoop.
