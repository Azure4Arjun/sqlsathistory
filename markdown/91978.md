## Title: Quest: Real-time Monitoring with Spotlight on SQL Server and Foglight
## Abstract:
### In this overview you’ll see how Spotlight and Foglight give you real-time performance alerts and brings together all of your critical database metrics into a single dashboard-style screen, color-coded for problem severity and clickable for rapid diagnostics.  You’ll also see how Spotlight and Foglight’s analytics screens enable a deep dive into which queries caused exactly how much of each type of workload at particular times.
