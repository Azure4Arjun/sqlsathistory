## Title: Where the Heck in Azure is SSIS?
## Abstract:
### Microsoft finally has a good migration target for on-premise SQL workloads with Azure SQL Managed Instance.  But the SQL Server database engine is only one component in the whole SQL Server product toolkit.  SQL Server Integration Services is used with almost every SQL Server deployment.  This session will discuss and demonstrate how to migrate existing SSIS packages to Azure.
