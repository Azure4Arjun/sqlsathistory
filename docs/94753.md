## Title: Monitoring SQL Server with Telegraf/InfluxDB/Grafana -- Lessons from the Trenches
## Abstract:
### Following Tracy Boggiano's presentation to the BRSSUG about using open source tools to monitor SQL Server, I tried it myself. Now I can't imagine doing my job without it. But getting to this point required a significant amount of research and trial and error. In this presentation I would like to share some of the lessons learned in this process, so you can get your monitoring solution running and tailored to your needs efficiently.

The topics I will address include:
- What data is captured by the SQL Server Telegraf plugin
- Querying Telegraf data on InfluxDB
- Writing InfluxDB queries for Grafana panels
- Grafana panel/dashboard configuration options
- Grafana permissions  authentication
- Querying SQL Server directly from Grafana
