## Speaker: Buck Woody
## Title: A Day in the Life of the Data Scientist
## Abstract:
### Data Science is a new field in technology, and has begun to mature, splintering off into many disciplines. Like any complex role, there isn't one single skillset and knowledge-base required for Data Science. Buck Woody, an Applied Data Scientist from the SQL Server Product Group at Microsoft explains Data Science using a "day" to show you the processes and procedures a Data Scientist uses, and how you can learn the skills, math, languages and platforms involved in a Data Science role.
