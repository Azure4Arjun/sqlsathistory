## Title: Backup and Recovery
## Abstract:
### "Backup and Recovery" is the most basic fundamental responsibility of any DBA, and your mastery (or lack thereof) of this topic can make you a hero or get you fired.  Beginner level folks will benefit from this talk because we'll cover the basics, but I think even more experienced DBA's might learn a few tricks.
Outline:
 * Review the fundamentals (recovery models, backup types, etc) with use cases
 * Give practical examples w/ syntax
 * Do performance tuning on backups
 * Recommend best practices and strategies
