## Speaker: Jemini Joseph
## Title: SSIS Factory (Dobler Consulting)
## Abstract:
### Assume that you want to create packages to load 100's files (text or Excel) that you receive from vendors and structure of data in the files are different.  How long it can take? How about creating a simple tool for your manager who doesn't know anything about SSIS  to create packages for transferring data between servers?  You want to find out which package, among 100's of them  already running, update/insert a particular table . How long it will take to open each package and get the answer? 

We can automate all these process using C# (or Visual Basic) and SSIS SDK. Can it be more interesting if the conversion of those 2008 packages to 2012/2014 and deploy it to the new SSISDB using project deployment model can be automated too? If you are an SSIS expert with some knowledge of programming and like automation, you will have fun in this session.
