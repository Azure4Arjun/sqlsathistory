## Title: Third Party Tools for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### During of my work in the field (for more than 17 years) I noticed that very few people are aware that SQL Server has a great ecosystem of partners that come with functionality where Microsoft tools don't do it, or don't go in depth. Even more, some of the are offered for free and my session will expose as many as possible.
