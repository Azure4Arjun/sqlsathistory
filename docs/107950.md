## Title: Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
## Abstract:
### Gaps and islands problems are often treated as academic problems that are discussed without relevant real-life problems to solve.

By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion.  We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data in order to everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.
