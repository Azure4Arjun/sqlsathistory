## Title: Introducing the Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### The Azure Data Factory was introduced at the end of 2014. Data Factory is a cloud scalable data movement and transformation tool. Data Factory is not SQL Server Integration Services and will require some different skills to master. In this session, we will learn how to create a data factory to copy data from an Azure Blob to a SQL database. After working through that solution, we will look at how to use the Data Factory with HDInsight on Azure and Machine Learning activities. Throughout the session, we will look at managing the Data Factory in the Azure portal.
