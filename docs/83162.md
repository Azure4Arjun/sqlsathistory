## Title: Adopting A DevOps Process for Your Database
## Abstract:
### DevOps is changing today's software development world by helping us build better software, faster. However most of the knowledge and experience with DevOps is based around application software and ignores the database. We will examine how the concepts and principles of DevOps can be applied to database development by looking at both automated comparison analysis as well as migration script management. Automated building, testing, and deployment of database changes will be shown.
