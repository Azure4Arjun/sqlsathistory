## Title: Big Data - HdInsight and Parallel Data Warehousing (PDW) 
## Abstract:
### We will define Big Data first. Then, we will talk about Microsoft's two offerings:  HdInsight and Parallel Data Warehousing (PDW).  HDInsight is Microsoftâ€™s new Hadoop-based platform. It combines the simplicity of Windows with the power and reliability of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) to deliver big data insights from Apache Hadoop. PDW is a shared nothing massive parallel processing (MPP) relational DB based on SQL Server. This Session will explore how to load data to the Azure blob store, creating an HDInsight Service cluster, adding additional storage locations, and adding structure with Hive objects.
