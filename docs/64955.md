## Title: Deep Learning as a Service with TensorFlow in Azure Machine Learning – an example from Elkjøp Nordic
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning is Microsoft's go-to service for operationalizing machine learning models in the cloud. But can it do deep learning? The answer is yes! 

At Elkjøp Nordic, we use a neural network trained in TensorFlow and operationalized in Azure ML to sift through and categorize thousands of sentiment-classified customer feedback texts from our websites, allowing us to quickly measure how we are doing on major things like UX, checkout and payment, pinpoint areas where we need to improve, and more easily zero in on the important qualitative demands and wishes of our customers.

Deploying deep learning models into production is generally not trivial, and it's very common for machine learning projects with otherwise excellent results to be shelved before being put to practical business use. It doesn't have to be this way; I will show you how to jump this hurdle using the Data Science VM for model training, Blob Storage for... well, storage, and Azure ML for operationalization.
