## Title: Do SQL XML queries have to scare me?
## Abstract:
### I have seen days of amazing C# XML library coding work replaced by 2 lines of a FOR XML statement in SQL. Built into SQL is the power to make XML do pretty much whatever you need it to. Learn how to use the XML data type and built-in XQuery functions. You will also see how to join (or “bind”) a SQL table to an XML stream to produce a single result set.
