## Title: Optimising a dot.net solution on the SQL platform
## Abstract:
### In this case study we will take a sample dot.net ecommerce application running in a load test harness and show common performance worst practices, how to correct them and the impact on performance. During a series of live demos we aim to test just how far we can optimise transactional processing.This session is aimed to help developers and DBAâ€™s understand the performance impact of choices made within a dot.net application and its interaction with SQL Server.
