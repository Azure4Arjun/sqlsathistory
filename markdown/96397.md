## Title: Replace Hundreds of Fragmented SSRS Reports with Integrated Dashboards in Weeks
## Abstract:
### Has your organization accumulated a ton of reports that are crucial, yet fragmented and difficult to maintain? This session deals with the challenge of documenting those disconnected reports and replacing them with integrated dashboards. We will also discuss the trade offs of different data integration architecture options such as data lakes, dimensional models, real time solutions like data virtualization, and cloud based solutions. 

In this session, we will explore:
- Different industry solutions to document your existing SSRS reports and SSAS cubes to identify all the columns used in source tables/objects.
- Interrogating the database objects (views, stored  procedures, etc.) to decipher the ETL mappings and transformations and present this in a human readable format of data lineage with business rules applied to the source system.
- Grouping these reports into sets to be consolidated in a few dashboard
- Different solutions to accommodate the desired data integration architecture
