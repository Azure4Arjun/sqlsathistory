## Title: Speed Up Your SSAS Cube's Data Refresh With Dynamic Partition Processing
## Abstract:
### Are you sometimes plagued with the unfortunate event of your SSAS cube refresh exceeding the scheduled maintenance window?  Maybe you simply need to update recent data to reflect a critical change during business hours, but can’t afford several hours of downtime.  I have a solution for you!  In this session, we will focus on building an ETL framework while leveraging your cube’s logical partition design to dynamically process only the necessary data within your measure group.  We will discuss audit logging, cube processing options, partition design and metadata access.  These techniques and strategies will provide a faster data refresh process for your warehouse or data mart.
