## Title: Radically Boosting SQL Queries with GPU Acceleration
## Abstract:
### Due to exponentially growing data stores, enterprises often need to pre-aggregate and pre-model their data before they are able to execute analytical queries. In addition, slowdowns and bottlenecks frequently occur at peak processing times with some queries taking hours or some that are simply not possible to execute. This session entitled "Radically boosting SQL queries with GPU acceleration" will demonstrate how the power of GPUs can be leveraged to accelerate SQL queries and the speed to analytical insights. It will also discuss how to scale the amount of raw data analyzed to meet the increasing demands of data scientists and business intelligence professionals alike without the need for pre-aggregation and pre-modeling.
