## Title: SSIS Internals and Optimization
## Abstract:
### This session dives deep into the underlying structure of the SSIS data flow pipeline in order understand how the SSIS engine is handling your data and how to monitor and optimize your data flow design. This review includes a drill-down into the data buffer architecture, execution trees, engine threads, column lineage, synchronous and asynchronous transformation outputs, data flow buffer tuning, pipeline monitoring, pipeline optimization, error identification and troubleshooting. Understanding the pipeline internals will lead to better package designs with more efficient and scalable data flow architectures for your SSIS environment.
