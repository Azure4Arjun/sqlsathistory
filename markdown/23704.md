## Title: SQL Clustering - what it is, what it isn't, and how to get both
## Abstract:
### Windows Failover Clustering has been a common solution to providing failover and high-availability in SQL Server environments, and can be used to cluster an instance of sql server, as well as serve as the supporting infrastructure for AlwaysOn. But for a new server deployment, which should you use - traditional clustered instances or AlwaysOn, and what's the difference? While not delving into advanced implementation, this session will describe what clustering is, the components involved, how it's used (both historically and with AlwaysOn), clear up some common terminology around clustering, and help set the stage for your next deployment.
