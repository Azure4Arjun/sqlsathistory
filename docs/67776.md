## Title: Modern Data Warehousing: Analytics in Azure
## Abstract:
### Sponsor Session with Simon Whiteley and Terry McCann from Adatis.

Technology changes quickly â€“ patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a distributed cloud architecture employing a range of disparate tools.
 
This session will attempt to help you understand 5 of the key technologies underpinning the Modern Data Warehouse. We'll run through:
 
- Data Lake (Store  Analytics)
- Azure SQL DataWarehouse
- Logic Apps
- Data Factory
- Streaming Analytics

We'll then briefly show you how they all fit together into a coherent reference pattern for performing data analytics in Azure. This session is aimed as a primer for people considering moving to the cloud or for anyone looking to understand the current data analytics architecture.
