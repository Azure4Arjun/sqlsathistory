# Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#36-Wheeling-2010)
Event Date: 01-05-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Most administrative functions consist of repetitive sequences of tasks which just take time.  PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment which allows an administrator to automate those repetitive tasks, providing better results to the organization while saving the administrator time, and ensuring that the tasks get done properly every time.  This session will give an introduction to PowerShell and demonstrate a number of scripts which help SQL Server administrators effectively manage their environments.

# Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#36-Wheeling-2010)
Event Date: 01-05-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Server
## Speaker: Bronwyn Altizer
## Title: Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management
## Abstract:
### Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

# Intro to WCF Data Services and OData
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#36-Wheeling-2010)
Event Date: 01-05-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: David Hoerster
## Title: Intro to WCF Data Services and OData
## Abstract:
### Exposing your data to client applications is a common requirement across most applications; however, there are many ways to accomplish this.  Each application seems to implement it a different way which leads to inconsistency across your application spectrum.  With the release of the .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft has introduced WCF Data Services (was ADO.NET Data Services) which is a collection of classes and standards to allow you to expose your data consistently and securely to your client applications.  We'll focus on WCF Data Services in .NET 4, in which Microsoft has beefed up the offering, and also the data protocol known as OData.

# A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#36-Wheeling-2010)
Event Date: 01-05-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Jeremiah Peschka
## Title: A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general.

Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

Learn how to work effectively with diverse inputs.
Learn how to avoid common pitfalls of dynamic SQL.

## Speaker: Joe Kuemerle
## Title: Developers….Are We Just a Commodity?
## Abstract:
### It’s a contracting market.  Companies are reducing costs across the board.  With outsourcing and off-shoring achieving success, how can today’s in-house developer prove his value to the business?  Technical expertise is valuable to product and technical management. However, it’s the developer’s understanding of the business and his role in generating revenue that’s invaluable.  This presentation explains various techniques developers can use to increase their business savvy, proving they are providing value and not just an expense.
