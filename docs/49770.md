## Title: Tintri  SQL Sentry â€“ Optimizing Your Virtualized Workload
## Abstract:
### Come learn how Tintri and SQL Sentry can take the risk and guesswork out of virtualizing SQL databases. Tintri Virtual-Aware Storage (VAS) systems blend the predictable performance of solid-state disk (SSD), per-VM Quality-of-Service (QOS) and superior analytics to empower DBAs to confidently deploy even the most demanding enterprise applications with ease. Tintri makes complex database management tasks like cloning, backup/recovery, and test/dev refreshes a breeze through software automation that eliminates error-prone, manual processes. With the recent partnership between Tintri and SQL Sentry, DBAs can monitor specific performance metrics of their Tintri devices within SQL Sentry Performance Advisor.  Visit our booth and attend our lunch session to see Tintri and SQL Sentry in action.
