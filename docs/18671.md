## Title: Everything you would like to know about Power BI - QA
## Abstract:
### One of the Power BI features users have been interested in is QA, which takes data exploration to a whole new level. With QA, users type ad-hoc questions and the system provides them with answers in the form of interactive charts and graphs.  The search like experience is instantaneous and uses a natural language query, interpreting the semantics of question the user is typing. This session will be covered with a lot of samples of deployment, configuration, optimization etc.
