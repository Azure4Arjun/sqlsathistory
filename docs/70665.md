## Speaker: Robert Hatton
## Title: SQL Style
## Abstract:
### SQL is different than most languages. As such, there's a particular style of though that works best with SQL. This presentation will focus on the things that books and tutorials don't. It will provide some perspective about the language and how to break large problems in smaller, more manageable ones. 

Even if you've been writing SQL, this discussion might make challenging tasks easier!
