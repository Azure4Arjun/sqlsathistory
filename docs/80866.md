## Title: Developing Custom Extractors for Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Lake Analytics provides a set of built in extractors to process well-structured delimited text files. U-SQL uses these extractors to parse these files
But U-SQL is not limited to processing delimited files. Using Custom Extractors you can parse JSON or XML files.  You can use Custom Extractors to work with irregularly formatted delimited files.  Custom Extractors can even parse image files.
Developers have created Custom Extractors for these and other file formats and made them available on the U-SQL GitHub site.  We will look at two of these Custom Extractors:  Flexible Schema Extractor and the JSON Extractor.  We will look at how to deploy these Extractors and extend them.
