## Title: SQL Server Virtualization 201
## Abstract:
### So you have finally virtualized your SQL Servers. Now what? How can virtualization be embraced to simplify and streamline operations? What about making the systems more resilient to failure? How can it be used to improve uptime and simplify some of the more common architectures? High availability, disaster recovery, backups, and new server provisioning are discussed in this interactive session.
