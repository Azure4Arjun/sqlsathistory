# T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-585)
Event Date: 25-02-2017 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Aaron Bertrand
## Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Whether you are a developer, DBA, or anything in between, chances are you are not always following best practices when you write T-SQL. Unfortunately, many so-called “bad habits” aren’t always obvious, but can lead to poor performance, maintainability issues, and compatibility problems.

In this session, you will learn about several bad habits, how they develop, and how you can avoid them. While we will briefly discuss advice you’ve probably heard before, like avoid SELECT * and don’t use NOLOCK, you will also learn some subtleties in SQL Server that might surprise you, how some shorthand can bite you in the long run, and a very easy way to improve cursor performance.

By changing your techniques and ditching some of these bad habits for best practices, you will take new techniques back to your environment that will lead to more efficient code, a more productive workflow, or both.

## Speaker: Jack Corbett
## Title: Dealing with Data Quality Issues in an SSIS Data Flow
## Abstract:
### Anyone who has worked with SSIS has dealt with the frustration of poor data quality and cryptic error messages. Microsoft has gotten better at providing better error messages within the Data Flow task, but still falls short in some areas.  In this session we will discover how to get the real error message in a data flow task and how to isolate the rows causing the errors.  We will start by reviewing a solution developed using a script component and progress to a method used to identify data quality issues before an error occurs.  We will also discuss other options to handling data quality and errors.

# SQLCmd Mode - The T-SQL Easy Button
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-585)
Event Date: 25-02-2017 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: SQLCmd Mode - The T-SQL Easy Button
## Abstract:
### Ever found yourself writing a T-SQL script and wishing you could do a relatively simple task that T-SQL just doesn't support? Like running a SQL script and passing in parameters at run-time? Or using a variable across multiple connections without using a linked server? Or run the script across multiple instances in a single window?

SQLCmd mode in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the answer to these problems and many more. Unfortunately, most people don't even know about these capabilities. It's the T-SQL easy button that almost nobody uses!

This demo-heavy session will teach you how to leverage new capabilities that have been at your finger-tips the whole time ... well at least since 2008.

## Speaker: Wendy Pastrick
## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
## Abstract:
### Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.
