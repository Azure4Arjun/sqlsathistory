## Title: The Nine Realms of Power BI
## Abstract:
### Planning a Power BI solution  need to understand options  choices?  There is much to consider as you discover your inner Data Avenger.  Like the old story of the 4 Blind Men  The Elephant, if you ask 4 people to describe Power BI; you will likely get 4 answers.  Power BI solutions have 9 Realms.  It's easy to get started but things can get complicated quickly...  Should you import your data  use the cloud service? or keep your data on-premises using the gateway?  Should you use DirectQuery or direct access to Analysis Services, multidimensional or tabular, in Azure or on-prem?  What's the best method to secure data  control user access?  What to license?  How will users access dashboards  reports?  Can it be embedded?  A hammer or other tools?
From simple desktop  published reports, to enterprise-scale and highly-secured solutions; we will demystify all these options  provide a roadmap to conquer the Nine Realms; from Midgard to Asgard, and from Desktop to Power BI Avenger.
