## Title: Ignored Best Practices
## Abstract:
### As a Database Administrator, one will find that there are plenty of ways to implement SQL Servers, and develop code for applications.  While there is plenty of debate on how best to do things, there are some agreed upon practices that should be found in any implementation of a database project.  When these practices are ignored, the longevity of that server may be compromised.  This session will define the phrase "best practices", and discuss several things that should be found in any SQL Server implementation to avoid issues in the long run.
