## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Where should I be encrypting my data
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll be looking at all the various places within the application stack that data can be encrypted or hashed, so that as an application/database administrator/developer/architect you can make the best decision as to where in the application stack to do this work.  These layers include the application layer, the middle tier, the database layer, encrypting over the wire, transparent data encryption, encrypting using your MPIO driver and offloading encryption to your HBAs.
