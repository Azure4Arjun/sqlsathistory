## Speaker: Phil Ekins
## Title: SQL Server in AWS - Where to begin
## Abstract:
### This session will discuss your options for running SQL server in AWS, the easy way (and the hard way) to configure High Availability and how to ensure your Disaster Recovery needs are also met. 
We will also look at strategies for moving your data into AWS.
Done right there is rarely an "Easy" button for solid infrastructure choices but this session will get you well on the way!
