## Title: Mastering queries into XML data.
## Abstract:
### If you've never queried an XML column you definitely want to attend.  While targeted to beginners this isn't a "Just do this" session where you are walked down a chocolate path, then back on the job scratch your head to apply it in real life.  After this session I'd like you to truly understand even subtle nuances of basic query syntax.  Seasoned veterans stand a fair chance of learning something new.
