## Title: Running Microsoft Database Migration Assistant (DMA) on many inst
## Abstract:
### The DMA tool allows you to run migration assessments for different migration types: upgrades, moving to Azure VMs, Azure Databases or Azure Managed Instances. The problem is that, when running the User Interface of the tool on many instances and/or databases, it take forever to run and if session disconnected or anything fails during the execution, you lose all the configurations and results.
In this session, I will teach you how to run the tool as a scheduled task using PowerShell scripts, how to import results into a SQL database and how to run neat reports on those results.
