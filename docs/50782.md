## Title: Query Zip Documents, CSV Files, and Azure Tables with T-SQL directly.
## Abstract:
### In this session I will show you how to access multiple data sources (including databases, flat files on FTP sites, Azure Tables and even MySQL) in parallel, all at the same time, using a single T-SQL command, and return data from these data sources into a single output. This allows you to remove complex intermediate processing steps, query multiple data sources without moving data, and get to your information faster. This session introduces you to a project that has been in development for a few years, and is meant to open new doors to data acquisition and analytics. If you deal with importing data in SQL Server from multiple sources, this session is for you.
