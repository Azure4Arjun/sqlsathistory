## Title: Power BI: The shift to business-led self-service analytics
## Abstract:
### The recent past has shown us how the business intelligence landscape is shifting away from an IT-led paradigm to a business-led paradigm. This paradigm attempts to put the power of data in the hands of users for self-service. Power BI is Microsoft's self-service business intelligence offering, and is now standing out as a leader in self-service business intelligence. Join this session to learn what Power BI is all about and its capabilities. We'll then move over to various usage scenarios and how Power BI helps save the day. We will also take a look at how Power BI fronts the capabilities of advanced analytics on Azure, and brings it down to the end user.
