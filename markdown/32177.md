## Title: Power View and PowerPivot: High-Octane Self-Servic
## Abstract:
### The next-generation analytic, self-service reporting tools will knock your socks off! The Power View reporting experience in SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint 2010 takes user reporting to the next level and makes data exploration fun without writing queries and code. Come see the impressive performance capabilities of BI Semantic Tabular models used with high-volume, enterprise data. Two great things that go great together!
