## Title: Why I can't adopt Power BI
## Abstract:
### File under "life after Microsoft" and "lessons learned". After spending time on the product development team, Power Pivot and the other tools in the Power BI stack hold a special place in my heart. I've tried using them in the real world and run into some serious adoption blockers. I will give an example end-to-end Power BI application that wound up getting mothballed and give a project post-mortem. I will also talk through user education, licensing, support, upgrade, and other considerations that make it hard for me to love Power BI.
