## Speaker: Chris Hyde
## Title: An Introduction to Data Science with Python for Data Professional
## Abstract:
### Data Science is currently the hottest topic among data analysts and technologists, but getting started can sometimes be daunting or confusing to many data professionals.  We aim to change that with this full-day, hands-on course in which you will be introduced to data science and its basic methodologies using the Python programming language!

Together we will work through some real-world data analyses using several of the most popular Python libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.  We'll cover collecting and importing data, and introduce basic statistics around our data.  We'll then move on to create some simple visualizations of our data to help us identify trends and patterns.

Note that as this is a hands-on pre-con, participants will be required to bring a laptop with a working Python installation.  Full details on this will be provided prior to the session.
