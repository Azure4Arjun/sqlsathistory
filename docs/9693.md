## Title: Database Deployment Done Right
## Abstract:
### Deploying application code is easy, at least in theory: in a word, xcopy.But you can't exactly do that with databases. First and foremost, databases can only be changed through a script, and if you run a database change script that drops a column, there's no way you can bring that column (and especially its data) back without a restoreâ€¦ and that in and of itself is a whole mess.In this talk, we'll discuss best practices (and a few worst practices) in database change deployment, including change scripts vs. object scripts; source control and SQL; synching tools like Redgate SQL Compare and Visual Studio Database Projects; keeping track of changes; and efficient deployment and change management practices.
