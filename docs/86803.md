## Title: Inside Kubernetes - An Architectural Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### In this session we will introduce Kubernetes, we’ll deep dive into each component and its responsibility in a cluster. We will also look at and demonstrate higher-level abstractions such as Services, Controllers, and Deployments and how they can be used to ensure the desired state of an application and data platform deployed in Kubernetes. Next, we’ll look at Kubernetes networking and intercluster communication patterns. With that foundation, we will then introduce various cluster scenarios such as a single node, single head, and high availability designs. By the end of this session, you will understand what's needed to put your applications and data platform in production in a Kubernetes cluster

Session Objectives:
Understand Kubernetes cluster architecture
Understand Services, Controllers, and Deployments
Designing Production Ready Kubernetes Clusters
