## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: Natural Born Killers, Performance Issues to Avoid
## Abstract:
### Learning SQL is easy, mastering it is hard. In this session you’ll learn simple but effective tricks to design your database objects better and write more optimized code. As an attendee you will gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Ever thought that you were adhering to best practices but still seeing performance problems? You might well be. In this session I will be covering why the optimizer isn’t using all available processors, when the database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used and why the optimizer doesn’t always use the best plan.

You will leave this session with a list of things that you can check for in your environment to improve performance for your users.
