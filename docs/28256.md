## Speaker: Wolfgang Strasser
## Title: A Programmatic Journey Through SSISDB
## Abstract:
### With the advent of SQL Server Integration Services Catalog (SSISDB) a new place of storing, executing and monitoring SSIS packages came into existence. In this session, Wolfgang will show you different aspects of programmability in the context of SSISDB. Beginning with a short overview of the underlying database objects, a deeper look at SSISDB's stored procedures will follow. A side-step from TSQL to C# and the available Integration Services SDK illustrates a different view accessing SSISDB. 
Concluding, the analysing and reporting aspect of SSISB programmability is shown with some exemplified SQL Server Reporting services reports.
