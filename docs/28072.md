## Title: Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular
## Abstract:
### The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.
