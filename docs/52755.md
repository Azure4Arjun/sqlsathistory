## Title: Know what your machines are doing besides SQL Server! WMI,WQL,CIM and PoSH
## Abstract:
### There's far more happening on your Windows servers than just SQL Server, and looking at ERRORLOG won't show you the whole story: other applications stealing your memory, OS issues, hardware errors, and more.  We'll start by looking at several different ways to collect Event Logs automatically.  From there we'll delve into WMI and WQL, which allow us to query servers (remotely or locally) to get information such as performance statistics, System and Event Logs, and even changes within SQL Server.

We'll finish it off with two immediately-usable implementations you can set up on Monday.
