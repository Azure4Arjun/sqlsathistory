## Title: Big Data Clusters: SQL Server 2019 Meets Big Data
## Abstract:
### With the new Big Data Clusters feature in SQL Server 2019, you can store and reason over mountains of data, structured and unstructured, using both Transact-SQL and Apache Spark, a proven Open Source big data processing engine. You can dynamically scale-out your compute power by adding nodes, independently from the distributed storage (HDFS), to support your analytic workloads. You can also bring the power of Spark's Machine Learning library to build predictive models and operationalize them right inside SQL Server. And everything is running in containers and being orchestrated by Kubernetes. Come to this session to see what the Big Data future looks like for SQL Server.
