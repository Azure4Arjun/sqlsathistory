## Title: Implementing dbatools with Azure Automation
## Abstract:
### Azure Automation opens up a plethora of opportunity for organizations both in the cloud and on-premises. The ability to centralize code and execution schedules from one central place is breathtaking and beautiful as will be demonstrated in this session.

During this feature-rich demo, we will walk-through getting started with Azure Automation accounts, including account creation, runbook management and implementing custom modules. We'll also cover how the Az PowerShell commands can be used to automate these same actions. And finally, we will go through code using dbatools that demonstrates how easy it is to perform tasks against Azure VMs and on-premises environments.
