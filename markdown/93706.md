## Title: Azure Data Factory - An overview of modern data integration service in the cloud
## Abstract:
### In the world of big data, there is a high demand for dealing with NoSQL, non-relational, and unstructured data. There is a huge amount of valuable information hidden which needs to be excavated, integrated, analysed, and proccessed for business decision makers.
Big data requires service that can orchestrate and operationalise processes to refine these enormous stores of raw data into actionable business insights. Azure Data Factory is the perfect cloud ETL or ELT tool for those complex hybrid business data scenarios. 
The session will walk you through an Azure Data Factory overview of WHY-WHAT-HOW process. All levels of technical backgrounds are welcome.
