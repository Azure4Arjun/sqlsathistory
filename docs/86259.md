## Speaker: Etienne Lopes
## Title: Permission Granted... Oh, No!
## Abstract:
### Working as a DBA, I came across some creepy things in what comes to database user (abusive) rights! 
From users that were database owners, simply because they had to be able to truncate tables and read/write data to users that were Sysadmin because they needed to Bulk Insert into one table in one database!!!!
Yes... Creepy things as I said!
This is a very sensitive and (sadly) common issue, so in this session I'll be speaking about Permissions Management and demonstrate how we can address it in the best way, i.e. giving the necessary permissions without incurring into the risk of compromising the security of an entire database or SQL Server instance!
I will also show how easily this can be done ;)
