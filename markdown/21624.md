## Title: High performance storage designs for SQL Server virtualization
## Abstract:
### It’s 2015 and you’re still running your SQL Server on physical servers.  Why?  You don’t have to.  We’ll show you how to run highly available, performant, clustered SQL Server on Azure and Hyper-V.  For Azure solutions we'll cover SQL Server on IaaS including OS, VM and storage configuration.  Would you like to live migrate a SQL Server cluster node in a VM without losing network, storage and client connectivity?  You can using SQL Server, various storage options including virtual fibre channel, iSCSI, and shared VHDX, SMI-S, Hyper-V and Virtual Machine Manager with high performance guest clusters up to 64 nodes.  We’ll review the solution architecture and complimentary high availability features of SQL Server, Windows Failover Clustering, Azure and Hyper-V.
