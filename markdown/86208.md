## Title: Power BI Data Modeling
## Abstract:
### This session explains why data modeling is so important even if Power BI utilizes the in-memory columnar xVelocity engine or simply SSAS Tabular. Different data modeling approaches are compared from a performance point of view, but also the complexity of DAX measures is compared that are incorporated in different data models. 
New data modeling features like many-to-many relationships and aggregations have been released during the last months. This session demonstrates how these features can be used to solve complex problems and how these techniques can be used on top of large amounts of data.
