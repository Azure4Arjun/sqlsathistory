## Speaker: Jessica Jolly
## Title: What is the Power Query Editor?
## Abstract:
### How often do you get data that is perfectly tailored and ready to use in a Power BI report?
Less often than you could hope. There is a rule of thumb that says 80% of the work required to 
create a report (or a dashboard) involves cleaning and prepping the data. This is accentuated 
when you consider that 90% of the time, if you are having a problem with a visual in a report, 
it is because something is awry in the data model. In other words, it all starts with clean, well prepared data. This is why you need to become familiar with the Power Query Editor. 
In this session, we will cover:
--What is the Power Query Editor?
--How do you access it?
--What does it do that nothing else does?
--When would you use it?
--How hard is it to use? 
--A quick demo of PQE's capabilities
