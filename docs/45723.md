## Title: SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn AGs Break-through Perf Enhancements
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Groups shipped with two built-in bottlenecks:  the network transport and log redo mechanisms compromised performance and availability of high performance environments.  SQL Server 2014 failed to remediate these challenges.  However, SQL Server 2016 provides significant performance enhancements which permit us to more fully leverage hardware and licensing investments including processors, storage, network, and core licensing.
