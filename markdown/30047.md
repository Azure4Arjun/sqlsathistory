## Title: Transactional replication. It's not scary.
## Abstract:
### When I've encountered with replication first time, I've thought "Hmm, replication is not so hard for configuring and troubleshooting". It was mistake :).The replication is not as easy to understand from the first time. The next moment  when you got problem with it, such as desync of data between publishers and subscribers and vise versa. Replication sometimes is not readily to troubleshooting. 

In the presentation I'll tell you about transactional replication, about what is it, how to configure different replication schemas and how to determine the cause of problem which can arise.
