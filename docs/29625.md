## Speaker: Creighton  Kagey
## Title: SSIS in Denali
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover new features of SSIS in Denali in three main areas: the development experience, the deployment experience and the maintenance experience.  We will show the results of migrating an existing 2008 SSIS solution that uses package configurations, parent/child package execution and custom logging to Denali.  I will compare the new tools to 2008 and will also throw in useful tidbits of SSIS knowledge that I have. If you develop, deploy or maintain SSIS packages then you will take away something positive from the presentation
