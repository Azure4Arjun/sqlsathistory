## Title: Introduction to Pester - TDD for PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Start from nothing and use Test Driven Development to write a PowerShell function that uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to analyse pictures.

I will take you on a journey from nothing to a complete function, making sure that all of the code works as expected, is written according to PowerShell best practices and has a complete help system.

You will leave this session with a good understanding of what Pester can do and a methodology to develop your own PowerShell functions
