## Title: Knowledge from Data–FileTable and Semantic Search
## Abstract:
### If you thought the data in your database was growing fast, just try to figure out your unstructured data.  More and more knowledge is being generated in blog posts, tweets, web pages, and various other documents inside and outside of your organization.  Gathering all of this data into a usable repository is a difficult task to start with; making sense of all of the information and being able to find what you are looking for are in a whole other league.  Two new features in SQL Server 2012 make this daunting task more manageable.  We’ll cover how to leverage the FileTable feature to manage the storage of your unstructured data and then how to apply Full-Text Indexing with the new semantic search capabilities to find what you are looking for.
