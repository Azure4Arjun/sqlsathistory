## Title: Virtualizing Critical SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### You probably have already virtualized most of your SQL Servers by now. But, have you virtualized the big, hairy, temperamental machines that everyone fears but the business simply cannot live without? Or have you virtualized them and they are performing worse than when physical? Do you work where virtualization is one of those hands-off black boxes and you have no way to tell what is happening underneath your virtual machines? Never fear! David Klee (@kleegeek) will be presenting an interactive session where practical management and configuration tips will be presented.
