## Title: Access with SQL Server Express - Perfect!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Express was the best thing to ever happen to Microsoft Access, it provides security, multi-user service, and processing power beyond what Jet could ever provide. Now you can migrate small databases to a environment that can meet corporate IT policies and enjoy it without paying for a server license. We will discuss migration strategies to SQL Server Express, backup and maintenance, and optimizing the relationship between the two. We will also cover avoiding road blocks and what every SQL Server table should have when working with Access.
