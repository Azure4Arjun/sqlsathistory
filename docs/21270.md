## Title: Using  Database Projects to Manage Schema Changes
## Abstract:
### This session will demonstrate how to use database projects (aka DBPro and DataDude) for managing and synchronizing database schemas between environments.  If you develop databases, today, or administer changes and have not used database projects before, this is the session for you.  Database projects offer a great set of tools for detecting schema changes and automating the scripting process.  This session will help database developers learn the basics of the database toolset and help DBAs understand the output.  In addition, we will cover test driven development and look at how to avoid common pitfalls when making schema changes.
