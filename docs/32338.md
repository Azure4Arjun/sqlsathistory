## Title: SQL and SEO - Database Design and Web Marketing
## Abstract:
### Bringing marketing together with technology is a fine art that involves high tech tools, real life solutions, and most important human buy-in from the marketing and IT departments.  This lecture will delve into the use of the latest SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 technologies including recursive common table expressions (CTE), hierarchical data models, and CLR stored procedures for the IT side of the house while also delving into the use of analytics, webmaster monitoring tools, web marketing tactics and search engine optimization techniques for the more marketing minded.

Neither SQL nor SEO are four letter words and they go together perfectly!  So too can your IT and marketing departments as you tackle the new age of IT Marketing.
