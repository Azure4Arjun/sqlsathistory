## Title: Is Azure Data Studio Better Than SSMS?
## Abstract:
### Does SSMS sometimes bug you? Do you feel like Microsoft will never add new features to SSMS?

Updates are coming out every month, making it easier to use, fixing bugs, and adding exciting new features. Come see some if these new features deserve a spot in your daily toolbox to make your work day easier.
