## Title: Row Level Security in Azure SQL Databases using Hierarchies
## Abstract:
### This session will show how an organizational  asset hierarchy is leveraged together to provide predicate-based Row Level Security on tables in an Azure SQL Database without application changes. 	

Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating an Azure SQL Database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS using Excel.
