## Title: Indexing Like a Rocket Scientist
## Abstract:
### Performance is what your users care about, and indexes can both improve and decrease
performance. As a SQL Developer, do you understand the difference between a clustered and
non-clustered index or what a covering index is? What is different between OLTP and data
warehouse databases when it comes to indexing?
This session is a deep dive into
 Clustered indexes
 Non-clustered indexes
 B-Tree traversal
 Primary Keys
 Covering indexes

This session will feature live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using
statistics and query plans. Understand indexing like a rocket scientist by attending this session!

Some knowledge of T-SQL and Management Studio is recommended.
