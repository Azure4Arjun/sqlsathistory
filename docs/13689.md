## Title: "So you have a performance issue.  What now?"
## Abstract:
### You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".
