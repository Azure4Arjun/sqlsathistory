## Title: SSIS - SQL server information
## Abstract:
### As a DBA in a new environment you need to learn as much as you can about the SQL Servers in your enterprise.  I came across an SSIS package, created by Rodney Landrum, which gave me the core of what I was looking for.  This session will focus on the benefits of the SSIS package as well as provide a walkthrough of the SSIS package, which I have made several changes to support our infrastructure.  The server information included is OS edition, OS service pack level, CPU, RAM, Free drive space, SQL server version, SQL service pack, etc.  Session will also demonstrate how to deploy this package to an SSIS server and schedule it via SQL agent.
