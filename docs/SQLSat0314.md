## Title: PowerShell for Database Developers
## Abstract:
### PowerShell has become the backbone of Windows Administrators but not heavily adopted by SQL Developers and this presentation is out to change that.  Do you ever need to encrypt, decrypt, zip, unzip, combine files, export to csv format , import from csv format, move, copy, rename, even provide a nice interface to some powerful script you wrote?

In short, there is nothing PowerShell can't do an if you are a SQL Developer or DBA, you need to be leverage its Power!

## Speaker: Bryan Cafferky
## Title: Breaking Down BI Barriers with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is the language of Windows and as such offers amazing integration and automation opportunities. In this presentation, Bryan will demonstrate how PowerShell can provide self-service BI solutions, serve as a powerful ETL tool and augment database development with far less coding than other languages. This talk starts off where the introduction to PowerShell left off and focuses on the many possibilities PowerShell offers as a development platform. Questions that will be considered include: Is PowerShell a better ETL tool than SSIS? How can you provide a GUI to your PowerShell programs? Which is better C# or PowerShell? You need to attend to see just how important PowerShell is to the Windows world of database development.

## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: Network or Perish
## Abstract:
### As IT personnel, we tend to get boxed-in, stranded on our own little island. We fail to make people aware of our activities, both within our own organization and in our wider professional circles. Just like a shipwrecked captain waiting for the rescue boat on a desert island, if you fail to communicate, your career will be stuck with no possibility of progression. This presentation will show you how to leverage networking and self-marketing techniques that will allow you to set sail off the island and into new opportunities.

# Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels

Event Date: 18-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3 (PERF)
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: A dive into Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.

## Speaker: Todd Chittenden
## Title: Power BI Components in Microsoft's Self-Service BI Suite
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has made extensive effort in the arena of self-service BI. By now most BI professionals have at least dabbled in power pivot and power view. But there is so much more. In this session we will look at some new components in Microsoft's arsenal of BI tools. Power Query is used to retrieve data from a much more varied set of data source types than was ever available before. Power Map can be used to quickly visualize geocentric data with layers and Power Point like slides. Lastly, the Power BI content on your Office 365 site supports sharing your workbooks with others, and has the coolest feature yet: Natural Language Q  A.
