## Speaker: Mickey Stuewe
## Title: Techniques for Dynamic SSRS Reports
## Abstract:
### Do you need a navigation system within your reports? Do you suffer from report sprawl, having hundreds of reports written once and disappearing into the reporting services catalog never to be executed again? Would you like to see one report take the place of fifty?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then join me in this demo heavy session. Not only will we address the questions above, but we’ll talk about providing different layouts to the data in the same report, minimizing data based on the user’s credentials, and even techniques for colorizing various parts of a report using VBA code. These techniques will help make your reports user friendly and help you look like a reporting superhero.
