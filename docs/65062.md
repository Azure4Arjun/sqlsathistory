## Title: Microsoft R Server 9.1 Update: Delivering Innovation in Data  AI
## Abstract:
### This presentation will give an update on all the new features in Microsoft R Server 9.1. We will see how we can do advanced Text mining (n-grams  sentiment) and run deep learning networks for image recognition  with a few lines of R code. Spark is the new in-memory frame-work for Machine Learning and we will see examples on how we easy it is to work in Spark compute context and utilize Spark for improving performance. Many customers have requirement for running "many models" e.g. Churn model per segment etc. Microsoft have develop new functions that enables the data scientist to apply these many models scenarios.  This release includes significant innovations such as:

•	New machine learning enhancements and inclusion of pre-trained cognitive models such as sentiment analysis  image featurizers
•	SQL Server Machine Learning Services with integrated Python in Preview
•	Interoperability between Microsoft R Server and sparklyr. 
•	New machine learning models in Hadoop and Spark.
