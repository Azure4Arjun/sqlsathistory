## Title: Azure Synapse Analytics - Early Lessons learned
## Abstract:
### We were in the lucky situation to actively accompany several customers on their POCs and early developments of Data Warehouse projects using Azure Synapse Analytics. Based on those experiences we will take you with us on a journey from the first steps into this new offer to use cases and scenarios from existing projects. Let's explore the current set of features, childhood diseases left behind and potential for improvement.
