## Title: A System for Managing Career Learning
## Abstract:
### Are you investing enough time and in right place when it comes to learning new stuff? Or do you feel like you're spending too much time? Or, more commonly, that you're setting goals and then falling off track? All of us struggle to manage learning while sustaining a career and family. But it IS possible! This session is designed to give you a prescriptive solution to the challenges of managing learning; identifying what you need to learn, how much time to invest in learning each topic, scheduling and tracking your learning, and recovering from the interruptions that life throws at us.  My system won't make you rich, but it will make you feel in control of your career learning goals.
