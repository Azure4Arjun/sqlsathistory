## Title: Cloud Data Platforms for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### With the proliferation of both SQL and NoSQL databases, organizations can now target specific fit-for-purpose database tools for their different application needs regarding scalability, ease of use, ACID support, etc. 

Platform as a Service offerings make this even easier now, enabling developers to roll out their own database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations. All of these are new challenges that are coming into the field of responsibility of the SQL DBA professional.

In this session we'll compare the NoSQL and SQL offerings from AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, their use cases for each one based on our own client projects, and how they are different to the different SQL Server features we are familiar with.
