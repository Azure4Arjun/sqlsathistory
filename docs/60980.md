## Title: Tableau and Power BI-Compare and Contrast
## Abstract:
### The goal of self-service BI is to give users the means to interact and understand their data quickly. There are a plethora of tools in the Market. For many years Tableau was the undisputed leader in this rapidly evolving space. Post 2015 a new tool from Microsoft emerged – Power BI. It was and is still considered a disruptor in the Data visualization space.

Faced with a tool that has been in the market for over 10 years and a rapidly evolving product that has the backing of a Software giant from Redmond , how does an individual or an organization go about choosing the right product. Let’s dive deeper. In this demonstration rich session we’ll look at how the tools compare against different functional scenarios.

We’ll see how each tool can handle-

-	Represent Data using Maps
-	Drill downs and Hierarchies
-	Trending and Forecasting 
-	Grouping and Organizing data
-	Combing data from different sources and source type
-       Community support
And much more..!
