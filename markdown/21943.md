## Speaker: Peter Evans
## Title: Heterogeneous Data Environments
## Abstract:
### Analyzing data across multiple sources for a 360 degree view of your business
 
Not only is the size of data growing, but so are the number of data sources and the number of requests from the business to analyze it. Todayâ€™s data professionals are now required to access a myriad of relational and non-relational sources, mash it up together and provide in-depth reports and visualizations, and usually without a lot of time. In this session, product evangelist Peter Evans will show you how Toad can dramatically reduce time spent on accessing relational and non-relational data, simplify data integration, and how to collaborate with other users for a 360 degree view of your business.
