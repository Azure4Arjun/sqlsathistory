## Title: Beyond orchestration with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Back in the old days Azure Data Factory could only trigger data transformation from Azure Batch Service or Data Lake Analytics. With ADFv2 you now have options with SSIS, Mapping Data Flows or Databricks notebooks. This session shows you the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches and some demos to showcase how to make your choice of data transformation tool in Azure Data Factory.
