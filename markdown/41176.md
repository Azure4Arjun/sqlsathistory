## Title: Building mobile BI dashboards with Datazen
## Abstract:
### Join this session to learn how you can build your own mobile BI dashboards with Datazen, the new visualization tool complementing your existing Microsoft BI stack.
Datazen enables you to deliver mobile solutions rapidly: it allows you to develop KPIs and dashboards targeted for mobile devices like tablets and phones in a quick and easy way.  The dashboards render in native applications for all flavors of phone or tablet operating systems, but also can be viewed in browsers and/or embedded into applications. 
Join this session to see how simple it is to build a Datazen dashboard and publish it to the Datazen server. During the demo, you'll be able to follow how the dashboards change - on your own device!
