## Speaker: Kevin Hill
## Title: SQL Server Security model, in plain English
## Abstract:
### What is the difference between a Login and a User?  What is a schema? Why can I view one table but not another?

If the security portion of SQL Server is confusing to you, you are not alone.  Join me for a short overview of the SQL Server security model, using non-technical terms.  We will look at it from the point of view of something we are all familiar with, so that you will remember it 6 months or a year or more down the road.

This will be a highly interactive session, designed for you to be able to absorb the info without having to take notes.   Bring coffee and learn!
