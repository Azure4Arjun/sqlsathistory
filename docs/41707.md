## Speaker: Thane Schaffer
## Title: Critical Path SQL
## Abstract:
### Critical path SQL will focus on recursive common table expressions (and other proprietary approaches, if time permits) on problem solving in finding minimum and maximums for common business problems like minimum/maximum manufacturing costs and leadtimes in BOM's and other hierarchical data structures where a tree traversal would be needed. AdventureWorks will be the primary database for demonstration purposes.
