## Title: Sponsor (Slalom): The Age of the Customer: Data is dead, long live data!
## Abstract:
### Customer Engagement is alive, growing and changing faster than ever. It has completely reinvented itself in a handful of years and is creating challenging problems for companies, marketers and data professionals.

Social media and digital advertising is not only making and breaking companies in record time, but is also changing the data landscape and roles of data professionals with the same speed.

Join Rani Monson and John Ellis for a discussion about winning in the Age of the Customer and how you, as a data professional, can be at the center of this exciting new frontier.
