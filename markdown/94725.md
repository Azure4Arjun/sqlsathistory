## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
## Abstract:
### In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. Microsoft has fully embraced Git. It powers modern on premise and cloud versions of TFS (now know as Azure Devops) as well GitHub, which Microsoft recently acquired. 

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

Why should I store my schema in SSDT to help prevent developers from using code first ORMs.
What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.
