## Title: Intro to indexing for SQL writers
## Abstract:
### Are you just starting out writing SQL for applications or reports?  Did you back into a DBA role by accident?  Do you know nothing about indexes and think you should?  If you answered yes to any of those questions then this class is for you.  
This class presents indexes from the ground up and lays the foundation for solid index usage.  We'll cover what indexes are, different types of indexes, when to use them, and when not to use them.  We'll also briefly cover index maintenance.  
This class is designed for beginners and is designed to be very practical.  It won't dive deep on any one subject and won't bog down with technical minutiae.
