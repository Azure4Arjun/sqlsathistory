# SQLSaturday #228 - Cambridge 2013
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Ministry of funny walks (DEV)
## Speaker: Dave Ballantyne
## Title: TraceFlag Fun
## Abstract:
### SQLServer has many TraceFlags that are, for the most part, used to alter a specific part of functionality of SQLServer and are documented as such.  Many of the more interesting flags, however are undocumented, usage is not guaranteed to work across releases, but none the less can reveal some important insight about the product, your data and your queries.

In this session a selection of flags ( both documented and undocumented ) will be explained and why you would (and would not) want to enable them.
