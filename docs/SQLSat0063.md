# ORM's and the ugly truth
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-63)

## Speaker: Rob Sullivan
## Title: ORM's and the ugly truth
## Abstract:
### In this session, we are going to take a surgical approach to why I as a DBA fear ugly ORM's. Even though you can use views and stored procs as plastic surgery for an ugly case of ORM, there is only so much you can do if it is ugly on the inside. Slides generally bore me, so we will only be looking at a couple before we put on our scrubs and hit the OR(M) to perform an uglyectomy to create an ORM we can live with.

Technologies: I'll be using Entity Framework 4, Linq, MVC2 and a variety of virtual surgical tools.
I ranked this session as beginner with regards to the topic of ORM's. My session makes assumptions you know about execution plans, traces, the optimizer and other non-beginner topics in SQL Server.
