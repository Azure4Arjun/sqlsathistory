# SQLSaturday #1015 – Vienna – Virtual 2021
Event Date: 15-01-2021 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Thomas Martens
## Title: DAX - Musings about foundational concepts
## Abstract:
### Much has been said about DAX, and even more will be told, as DAX still evolves and the adoption of tools that are using DAX like Power BI and MSFT Analysis Services Tabular is growing. I got inspired for this session by questions from https://community.powerbi.com. These questions are touching the most foundational concepts. They remind me of my journey into the realm of evaluation context, filter propagation, data lineage, the scope of variables, and the mysterious world of table iterators, just to name some concepts.
I explain these concepts using small datasets that allowing us to perform computation without leveraging the cloud, but please be prepared for some surprises. The presentation uses a single pbix file that will be available for download after the session.
