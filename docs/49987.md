## Title: SQL in Azure IaaS | Business Continuity Planning
## Abstract:
### SQL server is a first class citizen in Microsoft Azure IaaS. Regardless of the where SQL workloads are hosted, it takes a rock solid BCP solution in place to guarantee minimum business impact when an unexpected disaster happens. If your organization is planning to move SQL server workloads to Microsoft Azure, preparing a proper contingency plan to recover in case of a disaster would be a mission critical task for DBAs and IT PROs. 

This demo driven session will explore the high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL IaaS in Microsoft Azure, design considerations for a highly available SQL deployment and leveraging Azure's cloud backup capabilities in SQL IaaS VMs.
