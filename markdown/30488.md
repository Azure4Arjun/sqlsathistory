## Title: Entity Framework 4.1 Code First
## Abstract:
### EF Code First provides an elegant and powerful way to work with data.  In this session, we will learn how to mark up our model with metadata, automatically generate a database, and efficiently query for objects using LINQ.  You will learn why the code-only approach of the library means that model layers end up being flexible and easy to customize.
