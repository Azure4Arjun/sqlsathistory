## Title: Resolving the Database Performance Problem Blame Game 
## Abstract:
### If you’re like most DBAs, you probably can’t even count the number of times others have blamed your databases for an application performance issue – not that you’d want to know that number. Maybe the root cause of a problem did originate in the database, but maybe it didn’t. It can be difficult to tell – especially when communication among the application, storage, virtualization, and database teams isn’t in perfect sync. Getting the true full picture of the entire environment is a challenge that just about every DBA faces, and native tools do little to help; they generally require a lot of manual work and may still fail to reveal the source of the problem at all.

You’ll learn tricks to:
•Understand normal (baseline) behavior
•Compare database query workloads over different time ranges
•Understand the performance impact of system and database change
•Monitor more than just the database
•Extend database performance data to other teams
