## Title: PCI For The SQLDBA
## Abstract:
### Are you storing or planning to store credit card numbers? If so, you need to learn all you can about the requirements for PCI compliance. We'll cover how PCI works from the requirements to the final audit, and eveything in between that you'll need to know something about. We'll talk about encryption, key management, logging, alerting, administration access, granular permissions, tokenization, and as much more as we can fit into an hour. It's a complex topic, but that just makes it more interesting!
