## Title: Performance Tuning with Traces
## Abstract:
### We'll touch on SQL Profiler and review its best practices so that you don't impact the production system while gathering data.  We'll take a deep dive into server-side traces (SQL Trace) and show how you can run a constant server-side trace with little impact on the production system.  We'll also examine the things that I look for when troubleshooting performance issues.
