Event Date: 05-12-2015 - Session time: 11:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: ETL in the Clouds
## Abstract:
### Want to make the most of the cloud but not yet ready to re-implement your systems in Data Factory? There is another way.

In this session I'll run through how to architect your BI solution on Azure. We'll discuss some general principles of cloud architecture, look at the new azure pricing calculator, then dive into demonstrations of automation services and how to turn any traditional on-premise solution into a Platform-as-a-Service cloud app.

SSIS in the cloud is actually more possible than you think!

Also there may be some terrible jokes. I make no apologies for this.
