## Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, weâ€™ll take a look at the various ways that we can apply advanced analytics by using the R programming language on top of SQL Server. We#39;ll consider the advantages and capabilities of SQL Server R Services and look at how to set up a development environment. Along the way, we will discuss the data science workflow and consider some examples of advanced analytics that are commonly used.
