## Title: AutoML at scale
## Abstract:
### Machine learning has become a vital part in many aspects of our daily life and is becoming more and more important. However, the performance of many machine learning methods is very sensitive to a plethora of design decisions. As a result, building well performing machine learning applications requires highly specialized data scientists and domain experts. It turns out that machine learning, a field dedicated to building systems that automatically learn from data, depends heavily on human experts. Isn’t that ironic …
Come and see how Azure Machine Learning Service reduce the demand for data scientists by enabling domain experts to automatically build machine learning applications without expert programming skills and extensive knowledge of machine learning algorithms.
