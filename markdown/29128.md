## Title: Inside SQL Server Wait Types
## Abstract:
### Have you ever encountered a wait type with SQL Server but can’t find any information on what it means? Perhaps you have thought the meaning of these is hidden away somewhere in a dark closet? In this talk, we will explore the internals of wait types within the SQL Server Engine. Rather than cover some of the more common wait types such as lock and latches, we will explore the more advanced and obscure wait types that may be surfaced by the engine. The ones you can’t find much information about.
