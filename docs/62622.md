## Title: Anomaly Detection
## Abstract:
### Anomaly detection is one of the most advanced data mining and machine learning tasks. There are many statistical procedures and data mining algorithms that can be used for it, including Expectation-Maximization Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis. In this session, you will learn through presentation and demos how to detect the low quality data areas with some basic statistics and with advanced algorithms. You will see how you can use T-SQL queries, R code in SQL Server, SSAS Data Mining, and Azure ML for this complex task.
