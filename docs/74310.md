## Title: Azure Data : SELECT People FROM DataLake WHERE HappyFace = TRUE
## Abstract:
### Discover the Advanced Analytics and Data Lake pattern in Azure Data Platform through a complete demo : how to get insights from text, photos and videos ? 
From different media files and raw data, we will analyze sentiment of characters and get valuable information in a Power BI dashboard, using Cognitive Services, CNTK, .NET and U-SQL.
This session will mainly showcase Azure Data Lake and U-SQL language. But demos will involve different tools like Azure Data Factory for data supply chain and orchestration, Azure SQL Database for corporate data or even Machine Learning technics.
Even if this session is demo-driven, concepts and features of Azure Data technologies will be discussed
