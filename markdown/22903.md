# SQLSaturday #131 - Phoenix 2012
Event Date: 28-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS
## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: Advanced SQL Server Integration Services
## Abstract:
### This is a demo intensive deep dive showing a variety of SSIS methods that you can use to load unstructured text files, gigabyte size files, images, XML, Excel, email, and binary files. I will share techniques that allow files to be loaded in real time with a queue system to load small files separate from large files, file merging for fast loading, and parallel file loading using master/child packages and custom SSIS objects. Finally, I will share useful C# code for parsing complex strings, data manipulation and file archival.
