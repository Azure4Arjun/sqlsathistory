## Speaker: Gilbert Quevauvilliers
## Title: How to store your Power BI Audit logs indefinitely
## Abstract:
### By default your Power BI Audit logs are only available for 90 days

In this session I will show you how to use the Power BI REST API to extract your Power BI Audit Logs

I will then show you how to store the audit logs in Azure Storage. By storing the audit logs in Azure Storage not only can you keep the files there indefinitely but it also allows you to be able to bring this data quickly and easily into Power BI Desktop.

Finally I will give a quick overview of what a Power BI Audit Log usage report looks like, allowing me to understand my users usage on my reports and dashboards.
