# T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-627)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Shehab El-Najjar
## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers
## Abstract:
### To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

# Using PowerQuery to track progress in tuning a stored procedure or complex view
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-627)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Ernest Ostrander
## Title: Using PowerQuery to track progress in tuning a stored procedure or complex view
## Abstract:
### Tuning a lengthy stored procedure or complex view can be a challenge. Set Statistics IO On, and have fun wading through lengthy output. Use PowerQuery to organize that output for you so you can see where intensive operations are and how your tuning is progressing. 
The focus of this session is PowerQuery, not stored procedures , views or the tuning process. Learn how to read all text files in a folder with PowerQuery, parse the files to retain useful data and then analyze using either Excel or PowerBI. In the process, learn the basics of the PowerQuery Formula Language.

# Query Store
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-627)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Sam Mesel
## Title: Query Store
## Abstract:
### Analyzing query performance can be tricky. It involves knowing several dynamic management views (DMVs) and accessing query plans that are still in the query cache. If you need to get performance metrics for a query which is no longer in the cache, or if your server is restarted it will be an impossible task.
Query Data Store is a new  feature that comes to help DBAs. By persisting query execution data over time, it allows reviewing of statements / plans / properties / statistics.
This session will show you how to enable and use Query Store features, like: obtaining queries with plan changes over time; analyze queries by CPU / Memory / other counters; forcing a plan; and other gems.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
## Abstract:
### ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

# Concurrency Controls and Isolation Levels in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-627)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 12:30:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Carlos Colon
## Title: Concurrency Controls and Isolation Levels in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server determines how multiple processes access the same data simultaneously based on the transaction isolation levels.  Because the locking strategy that the database utilizes to control access to data pages is different between the different isolation level settings, the effects on database performance will also be different.  The right isolation level must be chosen to achieve a good balance between data concurrency and performance.  In this session we will review the isolation level options in SQL Server, their effects on data locks, and performance considerations when running under each of the isolation level.

## Title: Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!
## Abstract:
### Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: On-Demand Creation of Dev/Test/Reporting Databases with SQL Clone
## Abstract:
### Imagine a world where developers and testers could run production-like environments on their own workstations, created on-demand and self-serviced. Raising tickets and waiting hours or days to get operations to deliver test databases would be a thing of the past. 

With Redgate's new tool, SQL Clone, this world now exists. Administrators and developers can create their own database copies in seconds using just MEGABYTES of disk space without ever touching production. Developers can see how their application behaves in a production-scale environment during both development and troubleshooting and operations no longer need to find disk space, provision, etc.

In this session we will examine how SQL Clone uses disk virtualization to enable quick, easy and even automated creation of database copies that are just MB in size.

# How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance

Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server and Data Access frameworks provide developers a rich set of features that help integrating SQL Server as the system database backend in virtually no time. This simplicity, however, often leads to common database design and code mistakes that introduce severe performance issues later when systems work under the heavy load. 

This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.
