## Title: Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder
## Abstract:
### There are many ways to performance monitor your SQL Server environment.  In this session weâ€™ll review Extended Events, which is one of the newer SQL Server monitoring platforms.  Learn the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to dig into the information.  With a few T-SQL statements, issues that could take weeks to research can be investigated in minutes.  

Goals:
1.	Define the architecture for Extended Events
2.	Identify scenarios where Extended Event can be used to troubleshoot performance
3.	Demonstrate solutions to real-world performance scenarios
