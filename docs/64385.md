## Title: PS > .\Install-SqlServer.ps1  "Automating your SQL Server Install"
## Abstract:
### Learn how to install a new SQL Server instance in less time than it takes to get a latte at Starbucks. 

My team manages hundreds of SQL Server instances, and performs dozens of installations every year. By automating our SQL Server install, each new server requires just a few minutes of effort before they are ready for use. Even if you only install a few SQL Server instances every year, introducing automation will save you time, and ensure a more consistent configuration. 

I will share my automation script, and show you different methods to add automation to your installation routine.
