## Speaker: Mark Wheeler
## Title: IA-Database Development using SQL Server Data Tools projects
## Abstract:
### In this session we will use SSDT to create and deploy a database project that includes unit tests to validate the stored procedures and post deployment scripts to insert data. We will also look at the other capabilities of SSDT like being able to refactor columns and do a schema compare.
 
By the end of the session, you will have the working knowledge on how to use database projects to simplify your next development project. We will also look at the different methods for deploying your changes and why one may be better than the other.
