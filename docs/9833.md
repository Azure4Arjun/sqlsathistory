## Title: Everything Columnstore!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduced the revolutionary idea of columnstore indexes which basically turns the traditional table indexing strategy on its ear. Then in SQL Server 2014, Microsoft upped the ante with updateable columnstore indexes! In this session, you'll get a deep dive into how columnstore indexes work, the performance gains, the limitations and pitfalls, and how to work around them. There will be plenty of real world examples and demos to boot.
