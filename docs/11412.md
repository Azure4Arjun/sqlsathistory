## Title: Global Address Data: Storage and Verification
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on the differences in address format and structure around the world and how that can place in the effective storage of "useful" address data within the Enterprise. In addition, weâ€™ll discuss how address data is "mangled" to be stored and how it can impact the overall quality level of any tool used for address validation and correction internationally. With 240+ countries and territories around the world, this is not a small consideration.
