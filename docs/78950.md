## Title: Sneak Peak on the SQL Server Tools for Linux  Windows
## Abstract:
### SQL Server running on Linux is already out there, and with this new version of the product Microsoft has released some tools that allow us to connect/query/administrate SQL Server instances.

Join me in this session and see the tools that we have available for the moment that allow us to manipulate SQL Server on Windows/Linux. You we will see the difference between all of them, the good things, the bad things and a handful of tips.
