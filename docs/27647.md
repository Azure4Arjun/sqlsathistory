## Title: Level Up: Understanding Azure's SQL Database Service Tiers
## Abstract:
### As part of Microsoft's aggressive cloud strategy, the SQL Database as a service has been getting new releases and new features at a rapid pace.

The biggest change so far has been the introduction of three service tiers: Basic, Standard and Premium.

Gone is the pay for database size system and it has been replaced by a system where we also pay for the performance characteristics and recovery features of our database.

Come learn the differences between the tiers, measuring performance and how to optimize the use of your cloud SQL power.
