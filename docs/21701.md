## Title: 5 Key Points for Effective T-SQL Unit Testing
## Abstract:
### In this session we are going to look at the five things you need to know when starting to unit test your T-SQL code. After attending the session you will know how to pick a good unit testing framework, how to write your first test, how to spy on procedures, how to fake tables and how to deal with constraints. We will also briefly cover test case heuristics that help with these questions: "How do I pick the first test?" and "How many tests is enough?"
