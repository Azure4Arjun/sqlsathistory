## Title: Faster  Leaner: Optimize DW Solution Delivery with Power Pivot and AS Tabular
## Abstract:
### You may not see this in the marketing materials, but the reality is PowerPivot and AS Tabular together provide some powerful options for Data Warehousing professionals.  This session is for DW  dimensional modeling pros interested in streamlining  optimizing the design  delivery process for enterprise-quality data marts  dimensional semantic models.

We'll touch on Agile  Lean disciplines,  how they can be applied to DW solution delivery. Then we’ll walk through demos of practical applications in the form of PowerPivot POCs  prototypes that can be promoted to AS Tabular models and refitted to the finished DW structures once delivered. We’ll focus on key DW challenges and how these technologies and techniques can be used to speed and improve effectiveness of requirements gathering and user testing, optimize sequencing of deliverables, minimize risk of rework and ultimately deliver quality DW solutions successfully.
