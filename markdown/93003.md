## Title: SQL Admin Best Practices with DMVs
## Abstract:
### In this practical and script-focused session, with roots in SQL 2005 but updated continuously thru SQL 2017, we'll discuss many best practices regarding SQL Server administration, maintenance, optimizations and monitoring using Dynamic Management Views.  DMV's are essential tools for the SQL administrator, but have a wide range of applications by developers, network engineers and DBAs.  We will delve into best practices for server maintenance, index fragmentation, XEvents, wait type analysis and future features.  This session will be informative and eye-opening to anyone from a junior DBA on up.
