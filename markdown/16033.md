## Title: Moving to XAML
## Abstract:
### XAML has been around for several years now, but most developers haven't had to use it yet.  As Microsoft pushes Windows Store applications and Windows Phone, that is going to change.

We'll cover:
Differences between Windows Forms and XAML
Basic layout of a XAML UI
Binding in XAML
Very basics of MVVM

This presentation will introduce intermediate+ C# developers to XAML.
