## Title: Data Integration: the neglected hero of your information environment
## Abstract:
### Every organization struggles to ensure data is up to date and consistent across multiple systems.   Often this results in the development of layers of system to system data integrations or repetitive and manual processes intended to support operational and reporting needs.

Enterprise Data Warehouses and Marts are often the only stores that provide single point access to data sourced from multiple systems - but these stores can be expensive and complicated to build and maintain and tend to lag behind business need.

Data Lakes offer the promise of fast inexpensive data acquisition but without specialized tools lack the structure that makes their data accessible and useful to the business.

A managed Data Integration platform can provide both efficient data management across systems and a shared, single point, store of data sourced from all participating systems.   A Data Integration platform solution is not technology or tool specific and can provide immediate and continuing value.
