## Title: SQL Server Analysis Services: a 10,000-foot view
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) began life as OLAP Services in SQL Server 7, over a decade ago. Since then there have been major architectural enhancements and SSAS now plays a central role in Micorosoft's Business Intelligence (BI) platform.

This session will describe major SSAS functionality, with demos to illustrate key features. We'll also examine the new SSAS features in SQL Server 2008 R2 and preview the SSAS Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) being introduced in "Denali", the next version of SQL Server.
