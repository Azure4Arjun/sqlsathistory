## Title: Monitoring SQL Server, Key performance metrics and how to interpret them
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has many moving parts with a massive amount of metrics that you can monitor to see how your system is performing, but which ones do you need to pay attention to, what do they mean and how do you interpret them? In this session we will look at the key areas of CPU, Memory and Storage, from performance counters to DMVs that you can use to check on the health of your server and gain insight into how it is performing. We will also look at some of the configuration options that exist which you can use to ensure that you have a healthy base on which to build.
