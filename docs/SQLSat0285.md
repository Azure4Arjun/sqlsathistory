## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Speaker: Dan Holmes
## Title: GIS Data and Solving the Shortest Path
## Abstract:
### GIS data is used everywhere for many reasons.  We are all used to digitally navigating maps on our computer or device.  How can we use Sql Server and a network (map) to solve some of those same problems without leaving the server’s process?  Then, once you have solved a network for one business case, what other problems can you solve with the same algorithm but in a different business domain and using a different network?

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 06 Pro Racing
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

# "So you have a performance issue.  What now?"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 07 High Performance
## Speaker: Ed Watson
## Title: "So you have a performance issue.  What now?"
## Abstract:
### You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".

# SQL Server 2012 Always On - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 05 Availability Horsepower
## Speaker: Eric Peterson
## Title: SQL Server 2012 Always On - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
## Abstract:
### Our SQL Server 2012 Always On system with 12 months in production and an 8TB data, you can learn from our experiances, the Good (yes, there are some really cool features), the Bad (not really bad, but features you need to know about) and the Ugly (outagess, causes and resolutions).

# Statistics and Query Optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 07 High Performance
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
## Abstract:
### There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
## Abstract:
### Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Speaker: Jason Thomas
## Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS
## Abstract:
### Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 07 High Performance
## Speaker: Joe Chang
## Title: Automating Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### Many SQL Server performance issues can be solved with the information from the DMVs, even if it is collected only after the occurrence. But why was it fine yesterday and a problem today? On modern server systems, problems may be infrequent, but they do still occur. And so we may have neglected to collect data on a routine basis. It is important to collect sufficient information to diagnose and a resolve a problem. Too many third party tools to stop after identifying a problem on the presumption that the DBA’s responsibility ends with passing this information to someone else. I have automated the collection and partial analysis of index usage, query execution statistics and executions plans in my tool ExecStats.

## Title: T-SQL: Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language. Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.

## Speaker: Richie Rump
## Title: Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers
## Abstract:
### Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 10 DBA Radar Detectors
## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: What’s Simple About SIMPLE Recovery?
## Abstract:
### There is a common misconception that SIMPLE Recovery means no logging, and this is a very dangerous myth to propagate. SQL Server does log database changes in SIMPLE Recovery, but some (not all) operations are minimally logged. In this presentation, I'll tell you what minimal logging means in conjunction with each of the three different recovery models. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and dangers of the SIMPLE Recovery Model.

## Speaker: Robert Verell
## Title: READY FOR PROD
## Abstract:
### As a DBA, my personal least favorite part of the development lifecycle is pushing changes to production. It means adding something unknown (no matter how well tested) to an environment that is considered stable and reliable.  Plus there are other things that myself (and I'm sure developers as well) would rather be doing.

In READY FOR PROD (caps for emphasis), we will explore how I believe pushing T-SQL script, SSRS reports, and SSIS packages to production should go, and I encourage those in the audience to participate so we can get an idea of how other environments push code as easily or painfully as possible.

## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie (the creator of Biml) will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 08 BI Traffic Analysis
## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
## Abstract:
### When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.

## Title: Everything You Ever Knew About SSIS Is Null and Void
## Abstract:
### With the release SQL Server Integration Services 2012, Microsoft did a massive overhaul to the deployment platform for SSIS. Gone is the old file based deployment system and MSDB. New to SSIS is the Integration Services Catalog. 

Along with the catalog came many new improvements, such as package and project parameters. No longer do you have to mess around with ugly configuration files, or the mess of passing data between packages. Also included are new reports which you can use to examine your packages as they run, or see the status of past runs. 

In this session we'll look at how the new project based deployment model simplifies your SSIS coding. We'll also take a dive into the catalog, uncovering the wealth of information it can provide.

# Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 10 DBA Radar Detectors
## Speaker: Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
## Abstract:
### Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.

## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server with SysInternals Tools
## Abstract:
### In this demo-packed session we will explore the use of SysInternals tools like Process Monitor, Process Explorer, and many others to troubleshoot various problem scenarios with SQL Server. This session is not for the faint of heart and is tailored toward those adventurous DBAs who often like to step out of their comfort zone. A fair knowledge of Windows OS internals is recommended.

# Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#285---Atlanta-2014)
Event Date: 03-05-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 11 Express Toll Lane ETL
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.
