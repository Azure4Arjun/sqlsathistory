## Title: SaaS/IaaS Compromise - Learning Azure SQL Database Managed Instance
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance offers you the best of both worlds: deeper access to the underlying virtual database server (infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS), with the high agility of software-as-a-service (SaaS). In this session you'll learn the Managed Instance use case and be equipped to make an informed decision on how you host your SQL Server databases in the Microsoft Azure public cloud.
