## Title: Getting Top Performance from SQL Reporting Service
## Abstract:
### You’re a DBA at your company, and you’re in charge of keeping the production SQL servers humming. You know how to maintain and troubleshoot those instances for top performance. But now your boss has given you a new task: find out why the company reports are running so slowly and why the server itself seems unresponsive at times.

In this session we’ll talk about how to get the best performance from your SQL reporting server. We will discuss how to administer a SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) instance; how to install and configure the service for best performance, how to see what reports are currently running, and find which reports are bogging down the server. 

This session will not cover report design scaling out, or SSRS for SharePoint.
