## Speaker: Clinton van Blommestein
## Title: The NoSQL DBA
## Abstract:
### When NoSQL first became popular the "No" in NoSQL was advertised as the end of relational databases.
Fast forward a few years, and the "No" now means "Not Only" as traditional and document stores live happily side by side.

The manufacturers of these NoSQL systems have also realized that SQL is the language that is used to manage and query data - SQL is well known and there are many people that are very good at it.

In this quick session we will look at N1QL (pronounced Nickel) which is the Couchbase query language, and how your skills in relational can cross over into NoSQL by only learning a few extra keywords.
