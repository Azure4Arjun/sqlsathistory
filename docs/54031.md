## Title: SSIS Tips, Tricks and Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Anybody can quickly build a SSIS package to collect some data…. But it takes a lot of experience and patience to fully understand how to build a full scale solution.

SSIS has loads of little settings and “hidden” features that can be tweaked, modified and changed to turn an standard package into a proper solution.

This presentation is just a highlight of some of the Tips, Tricks and Design Patterns that can be used to make your SSIS experience a joyful one.
