# SQLSaturday #847 - Orange County 2019
Event Date: 13-04-2019 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Thomas Hull
## Title: SQL Security, Encryption,  Compliance
## Abstract:
### In today's regulatory environment, expertise in security and compliance are table stakes in the DBA job market.  Industries that manage customer data (finance, health care, etc.) have strict protocols required by law and enforced by audits, which are kind of like a month-long root canal but not as fun.   
In this presentation we'll cover regulatory standards, security basics and best practices, and the various encryption options available in SQL Server (Backups, TDE, Column, AlwaysEncrypted).  We'll also cover monitoring/logging, go over some new features, and some bonus material on dealing with audits.  
I look forward to seeing you there!
