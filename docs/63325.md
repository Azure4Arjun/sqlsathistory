## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: Schroedinger’s Backup – will your recovery work?
## Abstract:
### If you do not test your recovery plan you are unknowingly running a Schrödinger’s backup experiment, as your backup can be thought of as both being a good backup and being a bad backup. Until you attempt a restore the condition of any Backup is unknown.

While Schrödinger’s  cat was a thought experiment that may have injured an imaginary feline, a failure to be able to recover databases when required can prove  terminal to both careers   and Companies.

In this session Patrick we will walk you through how to design,  create and test Recovery strategies. Using T-SQL and PowerShell you will leave with the tools necessary to avoid you own failed Schroedinger’s Backup experiment.
