# SQLSaturday #125 - Oklahoma City 2012
Event Date: 25-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Bonus
## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Mouth Wide Shut: Coherent Interviewing
## Abstract:
### The MidnightDBAs will guide you through the most important part of the interview:  the tech screening.  We’ve both interviewed so many DBAs who fail to meet even the lowest expectations during this portion of the interview.  You’ll learn how to answer both tech questions and HR questions in a way that’ll actually get you hired.  We’ll also teach you how to avoid common traps that  mean certain death.  This will be a very fun and interactive session and you’ll wish you’d been doing these things all along.  Come to this session.
