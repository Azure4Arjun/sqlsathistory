## Title: Sarah the Explorer: Navigating and Customizing the SharePoint Interface
## Abstract:
### As the SharePoint Intern for Smithsonian Institution’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, I created an interactive organization chart in SharePoint so users can find information on all the Smithsonian units in one place. I will go in depth on how I used SharePoint web parts, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to create an image map with modals to display each unit’s information and the obstacles I faced with the customizations.
