## Title: SQL Server Big Data Cluster
## Abstract:
### Another new SQL Server version, another great new feature. SQL Server big data cluster (BDC) is here. In fact, it is not just a feature, it is a whole platform. BDC combines multiple technologies, deployed as containers, orchestrated by Kubernetes. Its sole purpose is to offer a unified platform that allows us to easily combine and analyze our high-value relational data with high-volume big data.
During this session we will go over the architecture of the platform and we will see it in action.
