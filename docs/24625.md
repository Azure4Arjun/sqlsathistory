## Title: Performance baseline your new SQL instance 
## Abstract:
### Using freely available tools to baseline your new SQL server instance.  Using Crystal disk mark, SQLIO, Memtest86, and Dell DVDstore tools to measure, baseline and compare results of your new hardware.  Crystal disk mark and SQLIO will test IO subsystems ; memtest86 will test your memory before you put it into production.  Dell DVDstore will be used to create a database enabling you to put a synthetic load simulating numerous users to your SQL server instance, enabling the creation of solid baselines when putting the server under a heavy load.  Using the benchmarks to determine capacity of the hardware and will it met the expected load.
