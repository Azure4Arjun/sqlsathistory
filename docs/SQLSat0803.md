## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: All you wanted to know about CTE's but were afraid to ask
## Abstract:
### In today's complex business environment, it is imperative that we provide the decision maker with information in a timely manner. One of the most powerful, efficient and effective ways of achieving our goal is by "working smarter" with our SQL Code. In this presentation we shall be looking and working with cool ways and means of getting the information out of the door, utilizing Common Table Expressions or CTE's to render the necessary data. This is your chance to experience first hand the power of these fantastic structures!! Carpe Diem!!!

# Wading into Stream Analytics
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-803)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Andrew Collier
## Title: Wading into Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### Large volumes of data originate at high velocity from various sources including IoT devices and sensors, web sites and social media feeds. A common approach is to simply store these data for offline processing.

Processing that in many instances never happens...

Wouldn't it be more efficient and effective to process the data stream as it arrives?

Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine which enables processing of streaming data in real time. It can handle up to 1 Gb of data per second, which should suffice for most applications.

In this tutorial I'll take you through the processing of setting up a job on Azure Stream Analytics. I'll look specifically at the following:

- connecting to a data source
- extracting information
- identifying patterns and relationships
- using machine learning
- triggering actions
- reporting tools and
- offline processing.

To illustrate these concepts we'll build a real time sentiment analysis system for streaming data from Twitter.

Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: An introduction to SQLDatawarehouse
## Abstract:
### The Azure SQL Datawarehouse is intended for large-scale data processing in the cloud, but it’s not just a really big managed SQL Server instance. 
In this session, I’ll take you through the architecture of Azure SQL Datawarehouse, how it differs from a regular SQL Server and what those differences mean for database design, query design and usage patterns.

# SQL Server Extensibility Framework
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-803)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Niels Berglund
## Title: SQL Server Extensibility Framework
## Abstract:
### You may ask yourself what SQL Server Extensibility Framework (SSEF) is. Well, you may know it under another name: SQL Server Machine Learning Services (ML services). The thing is that since Python was added to the languages of SQL Server ML Services, you no longer are limited to purely data science "stuff" in SQL Server ML Services, you can do a lot of other things as well. So in this session, we will "use and abuse" SSEF and through lots of code and demos see what awesome things we can do!

## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!
## Abstract:
### Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

## Speaker: Jodi Craig
## Title: Deadlocks: What they are and how to resolve them
## Abstract:
### Deadlocks are a swear word in DB world. They always tend to happen at the worst possible time, are extremely difficult to recreate and the deadlock graph looks like some sort of abstract art.

So when your DBA tells you that you need to fix a deadlock: what is it and how should you go about resolving it?

# Power BI data preparation with Dataflows
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-803)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Michael Johnson
## Title: Power BI data preparation with Dataflows
## Abstract:
### Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of an analytics project and getting this right is vital if the results are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI has empowered users to answer important questions, ensuring well-managed data is available to all employees remains one of businesses biggest challenges. Dataflows is an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can be easily consumed by business analysts, thereby improving the speed at which business value can be delivered. Dataflows provides a single-version-of-the-truth which was traditionally attained by building a data warehouse. You will learn -How Dataflows can be used to create rich, vetted datasets -How Dataflows can be created with the click of a button, ingesting data from many well knows SAAS solution such as Dynamics and Salesforce -How to manage Dataflows using advanced data preparation tools such as Databricks
