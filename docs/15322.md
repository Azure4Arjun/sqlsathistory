## Title: Automating Data Warehouse Patterns Through Metadata
## Abstract:
### Around 80% of the work to create a data warehouse/BI solution is spent on the ETL phase. Although building an ETL solution can be a challenge, you can break down the project into at least two separate processes for easier management. One process is strictly related to business modeling, and therefore cannot be replicated. But the other is made up of purely technical processes that are always the same, regardless of the business environment we operate in, and thus can be highly automated. 

In this session, we will look at well-known patterns to solving common problems and how they can be automated with the help of specific tools and techniques that use metadata to reduce development time and bugs. Using these engineering techniques, you will be able to adopt an Agile approach to your BI solution.
