## Speaker: Sławomir Drzymała
## Title: Power-up your BI project with PowerApps
## Abstract:
### The world is not perfect as well as any IT project is. In Business Intelligence, as an example, it's almost impossible to avoid some flat files and/or user input. Usually you will repeat and do some stuff manually on your own or you will create an Excel or flat file upload interface. But maybe there is a better way... What do you say about giving to the users the web application that looks nice, automate the boring stuff for you and send the data to your data warehouse and also doesn't require a lot of development? This can be done with PowerApps and maybe Microsoft Flow. During the session I will first of all introduce PowerApps and Microsoft Flow, and also will share with some experience from previous usage. I will show you how easy it is to create the application, but also I will tell you what sucks and what do you need to keep in mind if you really want to use these two technologies in real world.
