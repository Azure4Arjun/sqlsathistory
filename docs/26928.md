## Title: Track'em! What are DBA's doing on my server?
## Abstract:
### Everyday a DBA needs to access our system. They might need to make a change. Can I see what they
did, of course. Let's look at DDL tracking, events and service broker to see how we can see security,
object and jog changes. What did that DBA really to in our Sql Server? We need a log to show our
auditor, let's prove what the DBA did.
