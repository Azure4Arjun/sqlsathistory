## Title: Data Quality Services (Deep dive)
## Abstract:
### Data Quality Services (DQS) is one of the main mechanisms for data normalization, removing duplicate content and filling knowledge base. It allows you to perform various operations to obtain quality data. The main feature is the creation of the knowledge base, in which there are basic configuration, data manipulation rules. DQS Cleansing is the standard SSIS control, which is used for normalization (cleansing) data.

In this session two new controls will be introduced: DQS Domain Value Import and DQS Matching Transformation. During the session SSIS package will be created. This package will automate the process of importing domain entities, including synonyms, to the existing knowledge base. Also mechanism for removing duplicates will be applied, relying on returned weights coefficients compared between each set of records.
