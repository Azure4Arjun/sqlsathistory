## Title: Impementing CD with SQL Server on Linux, Docker  Kubernetes
## Abstract:
### DevOps is everywhere now days. Short development cycles with continuous delivery is the new black, leveraged by container based development. Nevertheless, relational databases were always a pain point when configuring an effective CD pipeline.... until now. 
In this session we will show you how can easily take advantage of the new SQL Server on Linux, to setup a high availability set with persistent storage on Kubernetes and put all this infrastructure as part of a CD pipeline.
