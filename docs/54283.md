## Title: SSAS Tabular 2016: Not the Little Brother Anymore!
## Abstract:
### Since released with SQL Server 2012, SSAS Tabular has been considered appropriate for small to mid-sized BI projects such as Power Pivot migrations but not equipped for large-scale enterprise deployments. Features such as many-to-many relationships, role playing dimensions, language translations as well as query performance at scale have all been factors driving BI professionals to continue to use SSAS Multidimensional mode for corporate BI projects. SSAS Tabular 2016 addresses many of these gaps and also offers a powerful DirectQuery mode, a new Object Model and scripting language, new DAX functions, parallel partition processing, and benefits from a close relationship with Power BI and Excel. 

Come to this session to learn about the new features, walk through the essential design and administration tasks, and see how Tabular can be leveraged by different reporting and analysis tools including Power BI, Excel, and SSRS.
