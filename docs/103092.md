## Title: Adaptive Query processing in action
## Abstract:
### Adaptive query processing improves the quality of a query plan. This helps in selecting the right join, right order of operation and more accurate memory allocation to fit the requested data in the memory. The three techniques of adaptive query processing make SQL Server 2017 significantly faster at processing the workload, even without refactoring the T-SQL Code.

In this session we will talk about the key components of adaptive query processing, Batch mode Memory grant feedback, Adaptive joins and Interleaved execution of table valued functions. We will also discuss the improvements that are coming in SQL Server 2019. Finally we will show how we implemented this on real business case.

Come to learn how we utilized Adaptive query processing module to boost the performance on our most critical calculation procedure.
