## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Soft skills for Geeks: Don't be a flat boxer
## Abstract:
### If you like being the surly IT geek who lives in a dark office and gets fed pizza under the door (i.e. a flat boxer) this session is NOT for you.  However, if promotion, appreciation for what you do, and the adoration of your peers and management are appealing to you, you might want to participate in this one.
