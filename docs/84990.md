## Title: How to navigate through the cornucopia of power BI architecture options
## Abstract:
### How has your organization determined the Power BI architecture(s) you are using or want to move to?   Items like Power BI report server, Direct Query, Composite models, Imported models, AAS, SSAS Tabular, Embedding, Premium SKUs (A, EM, or P), licensing requirements, are your users internal or external, cost, etc. are things to consider.   All of these can have a significant impact on your implementations.   Join us for a review of common Power BI architectures and when they could be used, what we did and why.  This is a very interactive session designed to discuss the audiences scenarios and questions.
