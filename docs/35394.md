## Speaker: Robert Hatton
## Title: Slowly Changing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Nearly every Data Warehouse, Data Mart, or OLAP Cube is challenged by changes over time. How do you report on a store that was in a different territory last year? What do you do when a product changes categories?

This session will show you how to design SQL Tables and Analysis Services dimensions that will accurately model changes over time.
