## Title: SQL Joins - Deep Dive into the Shallow Waters
## Abstract:
### You’ve already learned how to do SELECT from a table. You’ve joined tables together and you think you know how to code SQL now. But there are even more gems hidden within a connection of two tables.
In this session, we will review different types of Join predicates, such as LEFT, RIGHT FULL, etc., visually differ them from each other and compare their results. We also will go deeper to research different techniques of using joined sub-queries and functions, and after this session your knowledge on how to write SQL queries will Rock.
