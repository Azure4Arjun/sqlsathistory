## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: Handling data anomalies with Data Profiling Tasks
## Abstract:
### Within the realm of the financial world, data is often sourced from a plethora of financial systems that more often than not have different formats and business rules. This poses many challenges to the integration of the data into corporate data warehouses. Metrics and tools to detect data anomalies (prior to insertion into the corporate data warehouses) were often difficult to create and often overlooked. This hands-on presentation will show the attendee how we have been able to revamp and revise our preload data validations, often removing many of our ‘early warning’ queries and replacing these with SSIS 2008 Data Profiling Tasks.
