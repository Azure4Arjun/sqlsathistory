## Title: SSIS and SSRS Better Together
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  and Reporting Services (SSRS) are two pillars of Microsoft's Business Intelligence stack:  SSIS gathering the data and SSRS displaying the data.  Do you know that SSRS provides a set of Web Services that SSIS can use to manage and even render SSRS reports? In this session we will develop an SSIS package that exports an SSRS report to pdf format using these Web Services.  Then we will use the SSRS Web Services in a Data Flow Script Component to get data from a report.
