## Speaker: Wen He
## Title: SQL Server + SharePoint = BI Solutions
## Abstract:
### Tightly integrated with SQL Server, SharePoint 2010 offers greater BI capabilities through the new PerformancePoint Service, enhanced functionality in Excel Services. This integration of the most-used collaboration and productivity portal with BI products makes SharePoint the most powerful platform for building your BI solutions.In this session, we'll use the BI tools in SharePoint 2010 including using Chart Web Part to graph lists, Excel Services to expose data via REST API, and PerformancePoint to create an interactive scorecard and dashboard. You will learn not only how to take full advantage of these tools to successfully develop your BI solutions, but also why and how BI can work for your business.

Event Date: 01-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Track
## Speaker: Wen He
## Title: SSIS + SharePoint = Interoperability
## Abstract:
### Interacting with SharePoint has been a challenge due to the fact that getting data into and out of SharePoint is still not very straight-forward. There are a few different ways to extract or load SharePoint data including SharePoint APIs, Web Services, and Client Object Model. What is the best way to get data out of or into a SharePoint list?

This session will demonstrate the techniques to simplify access to the SharePoint Lists and to get data into and out of SharePoint lists easily by using SSIS. You will learn how to combine Web Services, CAML and ETL tools to create a high performance data integration solution.

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness
## Abstract:
### SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

## Title: Secrets of a .NET Ninja
## Abstract:
### In my years developing C# applications, I have seen techniques both good and bad. I will demonstrate those that are good, rant against those that are bad, and reveal those unknown to many. Whether a novice or a seasoned coder, you will find something useful, or perhaps even wicked, that you can do with C# and the .NET Framework.

## Speaker: Philip Japikse
## Title: Windows Presentation Foundation for Developers
## Abstract:
### WPF has now been out for a bit, and we've all seen the spinning cube playing a different video on each side.  How does that help you, the line of business developer?  I dive into what’s important to developers, including Layout, Event and Commands, and a deep dive into Binding, Templates, and Converters.

## Speaker: Philip Japikse
## Title: Mocks, Stubs, and Dependency Injection, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### So you aren't writing any code without having tests in place…well, except for those tricky things like web services, database calls, and that section of code that no one wants to touch since it's a pile of spaghetti.  I start with a big ball of mud and refactor that using dependency injection, fakes, stubs, and mocks.  I will show you how to use Mocks and Stubs to isolate the system under test and write cleaner, more effective tests.

# Lessons Learned:Being Agile in a Waterfall Sandbox

Event Date: 01-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: MISC Track
## Speaker: Philip Japikse
## Title: Lessons Learned:Being Agile in a Waterfall Sandbox
## Abstract:
### Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the development community.  But most non-development groups (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security, Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are not only far from agile, that are not trying to move to be more agile. I start with a refresher on Scrum, and then use real experiences from large enterprise development projects to teach you how to effectively work with non-agile teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them, I discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while remaining agile in the development realm.

# So... You've Inherited "The DB From Heck" (v2.0)
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-72)
Event Date: 01-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DEV Track
## Speaker: Troy Ketsdever
## Title: So... You've Inherited "The DB From Heck" (v2.0)
## Abstract:
### It's nice when, as database developers, we have a clean slate to work with. Most of the time, however, we inherit and must support existing designs and implementations. To add to the challenge, more often than not documentation of the database doesn't exist or is out-of-date with respect to the production system.

In this session, we'll look at some tools, techniques, and scripts that will accelerate your understanding of that beast you're now in charge of supporting and extending, with a focus on identifying and correcting design and implementation anomalies.

## Speaker: Troy Ketsdever
## Title: Predictive Analytics - You Can, Too!
## Abstract:
### Predictive analytics is no longer exclusively for those shops that have the resources to design and implement an entire BI architecture. In this session, we will review a class of modeling problems that are not only quite powerful, but are amenable to implementation via relatively simple T-SQL querying. All it takes to get started is the data available in your OLTP system, a basic understanding of the math, and a bit of imagination…
