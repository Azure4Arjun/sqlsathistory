## Title: Code Paradigms in BIDS
## Abstract:
### Using BIDS we are able to answer questions in two contradictory worlds the OLTP and the OLAP in order to do that BIDS is presented with the three services SSIS, SSRS and SSAS and a variety of languages such as SQL, T-SQL, MDX, DMX, etc.
It is impossible to explain even one aspect of one of the tools that comprise BIDS (Database Tools) even less to explain the main components of the MS BI stack SSIS, SSAS, SSRS in a single presentation. So in this presentation we are trying to explain the mind set of these three services and paradigms from the perspective of the problems they are trying to solve.
