## Title: Software testing automation myths and CI
## Abstract:
### Even though functional testing has been around for several years people still make assumptions which lead to major blunders. I am sure many of software engineers have heard a question, 'why manually test, when it can be replaced by automation tests?'. This assumption leads to major blunders in test automation. We will go through few of test automation assumptions and how many assume automation is a silver bullet. We will talk about how to achieve efficient and valuable test automation.
We will also go through, how to incorporate Continuous Integration into testing automation to achieve Continuous Delivery.
