## Title: Silent Killers Lurking in Your Database Design
## Abstract:
### A good database design goes deeper than the rules that Codd gave us. We need to leverage SQL Server to help enforce these rules. In this class weâ€™ll look at some common questions like: I have foreign keys, why do I need foreign key constraints too? Why are smart keys not so smart? If I use an identity field, do I still need to declare it as a primary key? The wrong answers to these questions can slow your queries down over time and even create bad data. Join me in my session as we look at demos to understand how silent killers can begin to lurk in your database.
