## Title: Migrating to Azure Managed Instance
## Abstract:
### This presentation will consist of essentially an after-action report of a successful migration from an on-premise environment to Azure.  Although this focuses mainly on migrating our primary database to SQL Managed Instances we will be covering some details of classic SQL VM’s as well as SQL Database.  
There are several phases that will be discussed, capacity planning, migration strategies and techniques, the big day and living with the cloud.  This migration took place in August 2019 and we have been living with it ever since.  Overall a positive experience, but I want to share what we learned so that the next person won’t stumble over the same steps that we did.
