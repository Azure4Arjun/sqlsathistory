## Speaker: Damian Widera
## Title: U-SQL in great depth
## Abstract:
### I would like to invite to the session about Microsoft Azure Data Lake and the USQL. I would like to show how quickly you can do data analysis using traditional C# and a new language that is a bit similar to the TSQL. I will also show more complicated things  -how to run Python and R scripts to perform even more robust analysis
