## Title: Thinking Outside the In-Memory Box
## Abstract:
### Even though in-memory OLTP can significantly improve performance of OLTP systems, it comes with an extensive set of limitations that often make refactoring of existing systems cost-ineffective and prevents widespread adoption of the technology. However, in-memory OLTP can be beneficial in other common use cases besides replacing on-disk with memory-optimized tables. 

This session discusses several of these use-cases:  
* Improving performance of ETL processes and stored procedures with memory-optimized tables
* Using the in-memory OLTP engine as a replacement for the distributed cache and session state server
* Enhancing performance of batch import operations with memory-optimized TVPs

Finally, this session shows several techniques that help address in-memory OLTP limitations, such as 8,060 byte maximum row size and missing unique and FK constraints
