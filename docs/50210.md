## Title: Service Broker - Put Me In Coach
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to Service Broker basics and how you can use it to for an alternative to ETL, batch processing and other asynchronous operations. Service Broker allows you to process your data asynchronously in a single instance. It makes for  a near real time ETL process. 

We will start off with the basic components of Service Broker. Then use what we have learned to  configure it to process some real life data using American Football Plays on a single database deployment. In addition, we will then use Service Broker as a replication alternative to show the ETL capabilities using databases on two separate instances.

At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to use Service Broker for batch processing, ETL or even an alternative to replication.
