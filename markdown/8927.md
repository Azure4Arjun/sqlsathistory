## Title: Top 5 Ways to Improve Your triggers
## Abstract:
### You've got a piece of code that you want to implement as a trigger, but you've read that triggers can grind your performance to a halt.

Come learn how to improve your triggers and keep them off the list of potential scapegoats for your SQL Server performance woes.
