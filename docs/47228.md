## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction into the PROCESS of queries. This includes how queries are Parsed, Resolved, Optimized, Compiled and Executed. We will see how this effects Batches, Transactions, and Errors. We will also briefly discuss the differences between Heaps, Clustered Indexes, and Non-Clustered Indexes. Finally we introduce Execution Plans and Statistics. The session is led by an expert Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) who regularly teaches the SQL Server certification courses.
