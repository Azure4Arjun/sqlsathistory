## Title: Getting Started with Database Automation
## Abstract:
### Automation is a data professionalâ€™s best friend in times of need. Automating our tasks builds consistency, reduces errors, and lightens our workload. The problem is, it is difficult to know how, what, and where to start automating. This session will cover building automation, from defining your process, to choosing your tools, and implementing it into your environment. We will use case studies to walk you through the process and give you concrete examples of how you can build automation in your own environment.
