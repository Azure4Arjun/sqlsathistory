# SQLSaturday #8 - Orlando 2008
Event Date: 25-10-2008 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Reporting Services
## Speaker: Neil Marchadie
## Title: Advanced SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### In this presentation I would present some of the more arcane aspects of SSRS including advanced charting, using custom code in reports, subreports and navigation internally and externally in Reporting services. I have been a trainer in the past and I've found it best that when I've made presentations my usual rule is to not allow any questions during the presentation, this avoids "presentation hi-jacking" by some attendees.  I aim at having at least the last quarter hour for questions.  I aim for above all an instructional and entertaining time.
