## Title: Handling Role Playing Dimensions in Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### Most data models contain at least one situation requiring role playing dimensional behavior. For example,  Order Date, Ship Date, and Invoice Date all linked to the Date table. The tabular model, available in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services, provides multiple methods for handling role playing dimensions. In this session, we will implement examples of each of these alternatives, including the DAX expressions required to fully exploit each one. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach as well as best practices when implementing each of these alternatives. Special emphasis will be given to model maintainability as well as the experience created for users exploring and analyzing the model.
