Event Date: 04-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Career
## Speaker: Jonathan Gardner
## Title: Adventures in Project Management
## Abstract:
### Projects that run long, run over budget, or flat out fail always get management's attention, and not good attention.  This session will cover the project management process and demonstrate how it can help deliver higher quality results on time and on budget.  

Case studies and real world examples will arm managers and team leads with tools including communication management plans, requirements documentation, stakeholder management plans, and change management.  These tools will help mitigate and manage common project pitfalls like status update meetings, gold plating, and scope creep.

At the end of the session attendees will be armed with the knowledge necessary to streamline projects and how to deliver a top quality work product.
