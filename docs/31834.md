## Title: Cool Things MSDB Will Tell You (If you ask)
## Abstract:
### We all have tasks that run through the SQL Server Agent. Every once in a while, we need to provide a history, a schedule, or even just a listing of what jobs and steps are being run. And lets not forget about backups and maintenance plan history. Nothing is more frustrating than sifting through multiple screens and logs to put this into a meaningful format. Mike Hillwig will show you how to query and present this data without needing third party tools.
