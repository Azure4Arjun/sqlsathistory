## Title: Getting started with Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 significantly raises the bar in terms of data security.  One of the most exciting features introduced in the newest release of SQL Server is Always Encrypted.  This feature ensures that data remains encrypted in its entire lifecycle - at rest as well as in transit.  Additionally, the encrypted data can be made completely inaccessible to database administrators.  With the assistance of an updated .Net client-side driver, this great new feature ensures that applications can leverage Always Encrypted data without application code changes.  In this demo-rich session we will look at how to enable and configure Always Encrypted as well as how applications can be configured to use this amazing new technology.
