## Title: An Architect's Strategy for Consistent SSIS with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Now that you've developed solid patterns for SSIS, how do you communicate that to your junior team members? How do you ensure they are following your practices? Let's look at what SQL Server 2016 has to offer the busy architect. We'll address some basic recipes for SSIS and how innocuous deviations from that pattern can lead to disastrous results. With fear fresh in your minds, we'll then cover the great new features like Control Flow Templates. Finally, we'll look at other systematic approaches for standardizing solution development.
