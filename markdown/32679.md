## Speaker: Robert Pearl
## Title: I/O I/O It's Why My Server's Slow - Waits  Queues
## Abstract:
### Based on the popular cover-story article appearing in SQL Server Magazine, Robert Pearl expands on ways to measure SQL Server's performance and present the information in a readable and useful format.  He will bring us useful tips for getting and analyzing I/O information, and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks.

In addition, Robert will scratch the surface and introduce performance tuning using a methodology called Waits and Queues, with respect to I/O. By using this methodology one can identify the best opportunities to improve performance, the so called “biggest bang for the buck”. These performance improvements are likely to have a significant return on the performance tuning time investment.
