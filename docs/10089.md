## Title: Performance Tuning Pit Stop for DBAs
## Abstract:
### Our users are in constant demand of faster running servers that spill out data before they can blink. Performance can be hard to measure and improve.  Before we get in the race we will cover how to get a Performance baseline using the PAL Tools. The first Pit Stop will be to review TempDB setup to improve performance. Before getting into high gear we'll pull over to refuel on some Log File best practices and performance implications of VLFs. Finally before passing the checkered flag we'll make one more stop to talk about Data Files and improving your mileage from there. After this session you'll have a good idea of how to make changes transparent to any application to get your server crossing that finish line in style!
