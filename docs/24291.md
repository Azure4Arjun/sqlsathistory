## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### As DBAs there are many tasks we’re asked to do every day that we just accept as taking a long time because of some manual component we can’t get around.  Many of these tasks can be brought into line with regex.  You can use it to format your own T-SQL and create code that writes code with relative ease.  I’m going to teach you the basics of regex and show you how to perform many tasks that’ll make your life much easier like deploying code, formatting T-SQL, and much more.
