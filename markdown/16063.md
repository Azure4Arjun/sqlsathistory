## Title: The Tally Table and Pseudo-Cursors - High Performance Replacements for Loops
## Abstract:
### Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL. There are dozens of things we do in SQL that require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters" and "loops" to most people and recursion to others. To those well versed in the techniques of "Set-based" programming, it means some form of a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. This session takes the mystery out of how these wonderfully compact tools works and they easily replaces many types of loops. This session has been updated to include additional information about what “Pseudo-Cursors” are and how they work as well discovering why “Recursive CTE’s” can be your worst enemy.  If you've never heard of a Tally or Numbers Table before, this session will change your life for the better in the competitive world of SQL Server.
