## Title: Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!
## Abstract:
### If you took a look at Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016, you may have had some reservations about it. It was a great concept, but because the database engine could no longer access the data, a lot more of the data processing was pushed to the clients. For many companies, that was far from ideal.

Enter SQL Server 2019. With Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves, the benefits of Always Encrypted are retained, but the SQL Server engine gains the ability to carry out operations on the data - without the data ever leaving the server, and without decryption. How is this possible? Does it live up to its promises? Come to this session to find out and to see how to use it in your applications.
