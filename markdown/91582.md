## Title: Creating an Enterprise Datalake without an Enterprise budget
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at a couple of approaches to create a datalake on a budget. The samples will use Python, Spark and some Databricks. It will all be done in Azure, but we will discuss how you could set this up on-prem as well.

You get to decide how far you want to go, from cost-effective to penny pinching. Don't worry if you've never used any of these technologies, I will start at the beginning.
