## Title: Hive 2.0: ACID and sub-second SQL latency with LLAP
## Abstract:
### Hive has transformed over the years from a slow but scalable batch processing engine to a interactive, fully-featured SQL query tool. The next phase in Hive takes processing even further by providing an in-memory processing engine as well as ACID compliance providing insert, update, and delete capabilities. This presentation will explore the present and the future of Hive and provide you a roadmap into this fast-changing technology.
