## Title: Agile Datawarehousing: tips and tricks to deliver your BI solution using Agile methodolgy like SCRUM
## Abstract:
### Now that we all master the delivery of a BI solution using traditional waterfall or V-model software development cycle and SQL Server components, it's time to enter the 21st century and adopt Agile Methodologies:
- Respecting Agile values
- Iterative on functional scopes and not technical ones
- Inscribed in a cycle of continuous improvement for people and solutions
In this session we’ll quickly present what is Agile, and we’ll demo mockup iterations to see how it goes in real life.
