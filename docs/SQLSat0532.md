# The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-532)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change how you tune and troubleshoot performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need to apply it to your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts as well as your Azure SQL Databases.

Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Mattias Lind
## Title: Entity Framework, from a database perspective
## Abstract:
### Entity Framework enables developers interact with databases through a logical model with entities and methods and such, and by default generate CRUD-operation and translates them to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. The session is about this and how we can extend the logical model with access objects within the database to support this interaction, and by that enable for performance optimization and higher levels of security without the need of changing a single bit of code in the application layers. The session is a bit like eating the cake and still have it left.

# Can Power BI Replace SSRS and should you
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-532)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Erik Svensen
## Title: Can Power BI Replace SSRS and should you
## Abstract:
### In this session I will take you through the differences between what you can do in SSRS and the features of Power BI. Power BI is moving very fast in features but SSRS still has features that Power BI doesn't support - on the other hand - the speed of developing reports and dashboard in Power BI is very attractive - so when should you pick the one over the other. I will cover available data sources, report- and dashboard design, how to filter and how can you publish the reports / dashboards in the two tools.

# SQL Server High Availability for Virtualized and Cloud Deployments
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-532)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Azure and Cloud Services
## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: SQL Server High Availability for Virtualized and Cloud Deployments
## Abstract:
### Virtualization and Cloud providers are providing greater and greater levels of abstraction from the hardware we run our SQL Servers on. But with this agility, ease of deployment and versatility comes a disconnect. This disconnect between what you, as the Data Platform Engineer, are trying to achieve and those handling the physical resources that your systems run on. If you don't reconnect, understanding how your Failover Cluster Instances, Availability Groups etc. interoperate with the virtual world. Then you can have a recipe for disaster.

In this session I will help you understand some of the main issues that can arise. Issues that bring the technology components into conflict, compromising the availability of your systems. Looking at ways that you can identify, solve and prevent these from happening again. Along with looking at some simple design patterns that you can apply in order to ensure that your systems are truly Highly Available.

# SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-532)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign key constraints are the ultimate Catch-22.  They are necessary to ensure the relationship integrity between a parent table and its child tables.  However, they may also have a significant downside effect on insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Key constraints and how they maintain data integrity when properly maintained.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling them.  You will also learn the possible side effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demonstrated with many script examples.  Attendees should have some knowledge of Management Studio and the SELECT statement.

## Title: Data Science and Machine Learning with Azure - Experiences from the field
## Abstract:
### Data Science is becoming an increasingly accessible discipline, and Microsoft Azure has several powerful, intuitive tools for doing everything from Big Data processing to Machine Learning. While the democratization of advanced analytical techniques is undeniably one of the biggest leaps within Business Intelligence in recent times, it calls for us as analysts to add a few new tools to our belts and expand our skillsets into the uncharted territories of advanced mathematics and statistics.

This sounds scary and initimidating, but it really isn't. We're going to prove this by sharing experiences, useful takeaways and practical guidelines we've established from working with Machine Learning and Data Science in Capgemini for clients within healthcare, public transport and retail, as well as in our spare time. We talk about Azure ML, Spark, R and Python, and most importantly; we cover the Data Science workflow itself and how to actually answer questions with data and analytical models.

# Re-architecting your old-school database to maximize Azure cloud options
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-532)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Azure and Cloud Services
## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: Re-architecting your old-school database to maximize Azure cloud options
## Abstract:
### The quickest way to migrate your on-premises OLTP database to Azure is to simply "Lift  Shift".
You create a vm in Azure and size it to match your local system and move your database into it.
This might not be the most cost effective way though and also, you still have to do all the
database maintenance yourself.
In this session we will investigate how we could use more of the cloud features like SQL Database, Redis Cache, Search, etc. in order to truly scale
our system. And we'll see if this increases or lowers the total cost of ownership.
This excercise is about an OLTP system but we will also look at how it affects loading our DWH from this new setup.

## Speaker: William Durkin
## Title: You don't need Enterprise Edition to do that!
## Abstract:
### The most coveted features of SQL Server are made available in Enterprise Edition and are sometimes released into Standard Edition a few years later. This often leaves a vast group of users who "window shop" the latest and greatest features and return to the office wishing they never saw those features presented. 

This session will show you how you can achieve the same, or at least a similar, outcome to some of those features without having to fork out for Enterprise Edition licenses or breaking any license agreements. 

You will leave the session with a set of solution concepts covering Partitioning, Data Compression and High Availability that you can build upon or extend and maybe save you and your company a nice pile of cash.

## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Algorithms For Searching Through Encrypted Data
## Abstract:
### Proper way of storing encrypted data is to encrypt it on the client and send it to the server that doesn't know how to decrypt it.
However this solution lacks a simple way of searching through the encrypted data once it's on the server.
You can do equality checks, but that's where most applications stop. 
But what to do if you have thousands of text documents you need to search through?
Getting them all to the client and decrypting them there is simply out of the question 
as it would slow the system down to a crawl due to latency.
In this session we'll take a look at a few algorithms that enable you to search through the encrypted text data on the server without decrypting anything and returning only the search results to the client with performance in mind.
Just the way a search should be performed.
