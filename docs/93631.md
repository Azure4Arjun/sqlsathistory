## Title: Exploring the latest T-SQL enhancements
## Abstract:
### With the most recent release of SQL Server 2017 and the upcoming release of SQL Server 2019, there are several enhancements that were introduced for the T-SQL language. This includes new string functions, bulk access options and approximate query processing among others that address several challenges that SQL developers have to confront.  

In this demo heavy session, we will go over several of the new features, provide a demonstration of how you can use them, and share any considerations that you may need to consider before doing so. This session is intended for anyone interested in whatâ€™s new in the T-SQL language and will focus primarily just on enhancements to traditional T-SQL for the database engine.
