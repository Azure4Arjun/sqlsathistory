## Title: Using Intelligent Insights and SQL Analytics to monitor databases in the cloud
## Abstract:
### How do we proactively monitor and solve issues before they happen when working with databases in the cloud? The nice thing of working in the cloud, is the amount of raw power we have available and the workflows enabled by leveraging artificial intelligence to everyday tasks of a DBA; performance issues, blocking, deadlocks, timeouts, waits and more. Intelligent Insights work hand-in-hand with SQL Analytics in the Azure cloud to alert, prevent and mitigate issues with databases, especially when working with lots of databases. This session walks the audience thru what are analytics in the cloud and how to better take advantage of this for their specific needs, also leaving a small amount of time for a QA, pushing an interactive session instead of just a lecture.
