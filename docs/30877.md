## Title: Real Time Problem Identification with Event Notifi
## Abstract:
### Event Notifications are a hidden gem in SQL Server 2005, just waiting to provide you with real time information about problems inside of SQL Server.  This session will provide a brief overview of the Service Broker components used by Event Notifications and then dive into how to build a monitoring solution for common problems in SQL Server like blocking and deadlocks that capture the needed information for troubleshooting in real time and provide email notification that a problem exists.
