## Title: Uncommon Techniques Every SQL Programmer Should Know
## Abstract:
### SELECT statements have a reputation for being very easy to write, but hard to write very well. This session will take you through ten of the most problematic patterns and anti-patterns when writing queries and how to deal with them all.  Loaded with live demonstrations and useful techniques, this session will teach you how to take your SQL Server queries mundane to masterful.

You'll learn things like a T-SQL code test harness, the value of clone databases, which temporary object is best, why CTE's don't help performance and can sometimes hurt, which cursors are good for performance, how data type inconsistencies can bring your server to a screeching halt, what single line of T-SQL code can provide double-digit percentage increase in performance, and much more. Attend this session to take your query writing and query tuning skills to the next level!
