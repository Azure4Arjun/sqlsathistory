## Title: Implementing security inside SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Having a good understanding what security features are available and what configurations are considered best practice can be crucial to your  company's data security.  Learn to view security differently and how key builtin security features can be leveraged to make your systems both more maintainable and more secure.  This is very much a HOW TO session, both in terms of how to decide what feature combinations work best for your environment and how to implement those features.
