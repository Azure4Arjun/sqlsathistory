## Title: Zero Impact Data Migration – Oracle to SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you have a mission to move from Oracle to SQL Server but downtime is not acceptable? 

 If the requirements for a migration project are -
     •  Continued user access to Oracle during the migration
     •  No performance impact to the production Oracle database
     •  Fault tolerance – no loss of transactions should the network or servers or databases go down

Learn how SharePlex can accomplish all of this with a quick and easy install, at half the cost of Oracle replication, and visibility into the replication stream. Also, learn about other business use cases where SharePlex replicating from Oracle to SQL Server can meet your ROI, and service level agreements, including real time reporting, data consolidation and distribution, and more.
