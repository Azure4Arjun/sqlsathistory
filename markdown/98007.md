## Title: Unleash Row Level Security Patterns in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Security is different from Sharing; Sharing is about sharing the entire content with others, security is about authorizing different views of the content to others. In this session we go through many different Row Level Security patterns; Static Row Level Security, Dynamic Row Level Security, and many variations of the dynamic RLS, such as giving manager access as well as employee access, you will learn about user profile security scenarios, and hierarchical access levels. This session shows you how DAX and Power BI security comes together to play an important part in a Power BI project lifecycle: Row Level Security.
