## Title: Women in Technology Lunch Panel
## Abstract:
### Encouraging the Next Generation  Everyone has heard that the number of women in technology is declining. How can all of us, women and men, encourage more young women to consider a career in technology? Join three dynamic Women in Technology – Kathi Kellenberger, Wendy Pastrick, and Jes Borland – to discuss this important and hot topic over lunch. Attendees are encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions, and share their experiences as well.
