## Abstract:
### Producing a good looking report will wow your business users even if your data isn't all that impressive. If you've ever had trouble finding the best way to display that data or how to show trends appropriately, this is the session for you. We will review grouping logic, graphs, gauges, and more in Reporting Services 2008 R2. With the knowledge in this session, you won't ever need to show a plain, boring report again!
