## Title: Introduction to Log Parser: Log What?
## Abstract:
### Log Parser is one of Microsoft’s best and most under recognized tools.  Originally designed to read IIS and system logs, its simple complexity makes it a true “swiss army knife” of a tool.  With its ability to read multiple log and text formats and then spit them out in a myriad of formats, it can be used to quickly analyze large amounts of data and present them in a readable format.
This presentation will start with some basic uses of Log Parser, explain some of the core features, demonstrate some of the challenges, and finally focus on using Log Parser to decrypt SSRS logs.  These decrypted logs can then be used as a monitoring system.  
As with most things, there are multiple ways to accomplish a task.  Log Parser will be a welcome addition to your tool belt!
