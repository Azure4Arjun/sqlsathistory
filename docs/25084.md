## Speaker: George Squillace
## Title: All About the SSIS Catalog (SSISDB)
## Abstract:
### Wow, deployment of SSIS packages in SQL Server 2012 is radically different, when the new SSIS catalog is used (“Who Moved My Cheese?”). This session examines the “new” SSISDB, its architecture and functionality and compares that to the “old” method of Package Configurations in previous versions of SSIS.
