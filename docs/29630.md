## Title: NoSQL-What is it and why do I care? 
## Abstract:
### NoSQL (or, more correctly NoRel) is a moniker applied to a family of non-relational software systems for storing data that powers some of the largest sites on the Internet. Amazingly enough,  non-relational database technology has been around a very long time. This session will include a high level discussion of some of the pros and cons of this technology compared to traditional systems like Oracle and SQL Server; as well as a survey of the most popular "NoSQL" platforms and who uses them. We will also cover a brief history of relational and non-relational databases as it is germane to the topic
