## Title: Dataism
## Abstract:
### The story of Dataism begins with David Brooks that used in the New York Times in 2013. Dataism is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of Big Data. More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist Yuval Noah Harari has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.
What is the impact of Dataism in our life? Let's discover that together!
