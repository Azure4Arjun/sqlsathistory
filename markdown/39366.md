## Speaker: Kenneth Nielsen
## Title: SQL Server 2016 - Always Encrypted - secure your data from the prying eye
## Abstract:
### In this session we will focus on the new feature in SQL Server 2016, Always Encrypted. A new feature that will keep your data encrypted all the way from the database to the application, and only the application consuming the data will be able to see and manipulate the data. Even a DBA in SQL Server management Studio will not be able to see and manipulate the data.

- We will see what is needed to secure the data
- We will build a simple C# program to Consume and manipulate data
- We will see how data looks in the table
- And finally every attendees, should be able to implement this neat feature at their own SQL server 2016
