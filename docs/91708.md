## Title: Women in Tech: Thriving Not Just Surviving
## Abstract:
### Join us for a panel discussion where we'll talk about succeeding as a woman in tech.  It's hard.  We get it.  We've been there before.  We'll be there again.  Sometimes it's hard, throwing yourself into that brick wall.  All day.  Every day.  But you can do it.  I know you can.  
But it's about more than just living in a man's world.
Let's talk tech,  Where we've been  Where it's going.  How we keep our skills sharp.  How we mentor other women.  How YOU can mentor other women.
