# SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#971---Oslo---Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 29-08-2020 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Ben Weissman
## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything
## Abstract:
### In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?

# Benchmarking in the Cloud
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#971---Oslo---Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 29-08-2020 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Gianluca Sartori
## Title: Benchmarking in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Lifting and shifting your application to the cloud is extremely easy, on paper. The hard truth is that the only way to know for sure how it is going to perform is to test it. Benchmarking on premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really hairy because of the restrictions in PaaS environments and the lack of tooling.
Join me in this session and learn how to capture a production workload, replay it to your cloud database and compare the performance. I will introduce you to the methodology  and the tools to bring your database to the cloud without breaking a sweat.

## Speaker: Marthe Moengen
## Title: Data is all around - so how do you control it? ​
## Abstract:
### Data is all around. And as the value of data has become clear for most businesses, they are eager to start using it to get better insights. Still, as the sources, users and need for data increases, the job to ensure that your data is used the way it was intended throughout the company becomes challenging. How do you enable your business to take full advantage of your data?

In this session, I will present how data governance and particularly the augmented data catalog can tackle this issue. In addition, we will have a look at how such a data catalog can act as a tool for the developers. How it can help bridge the gap between the business and the developer. And also why Gartner believes that an augmented data catalog is a key component for data lake projects to deliver value.

# Consolidation best practices
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#971---Oslo---Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 29-08-2020 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: Consolidation best practices
## Abstract:
### You performed a consolidation of your databases, but you run into performance problems. Having many databases in a SQL Server Instance is a common solution. It reduces licensing and hardware costs. But to have a solution like this working according to the SLAs we need to pay a special attention on the way we implement Instance level consolidation. There are some important rules to follow from the very beginning of the project. How to group databases and which databases are not to be consolidated is just the first worth mentioning. Performance monitoring and resource usage analysis becomes even more important in a consolidated environment. In this session I will talk about important things to consider when you have to design, implement, monitor and support a consolidated SQL Server Instance which serves many apps. You will see some good and bad practices from real projects, you will have a list of practical advices and even scripts to use in your environment.
