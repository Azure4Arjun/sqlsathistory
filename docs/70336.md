## Speaker: Nico Jacobs
## Title: When the ‘bug’ turns out to be a feature
## Abstract:
### You just finished a simple piece of T-SQL code, but when you run it, it turns out it does something different then what you expected… If you had this experience, hopefully you noticed it before it went into production!
In this very interactive session you will learn about common T-SQL mistakes, why the code executes that way, and how to avoid making these mistakes in the future.
