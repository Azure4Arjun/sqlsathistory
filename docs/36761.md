## Title: But I Want it in Excel...
## Abstract:
### As IT professionals we can create reports from SQL using Business Objects, Crystal Reports or other popular tools.   How many times have we created something fantastic only to hear the CEO or CFO say "That's great... but I want it in Excel".  Ugh!  

Don't do the export-import thing!  Learn some basic techniques to interact directly with SQL to create beautiful Pivot Tables and Graphs, right from Excel.  You can even ensure the CxO will always have fresh data and eliminate sync issues with your other reports.
