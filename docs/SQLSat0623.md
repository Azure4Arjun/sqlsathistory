# Analyzing Execution Plans Like a Pro
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#623-Israel-2017)
Event Date: 27-04-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Guy Glantser
## Title: Analyzing Execution Plans Like a Pro
## Abstract:
### The most powerful tool when tuning a query is the execution plan. In most cases, by analyzing the execution plan of a query, you can learn all you need to know about how the query processor has chosen to execute the query, what is causing the execution to take so long, and what you can do in order to make it run faster.
But there are common pitfalls that you should be aware of when analyzing an execution plan, such as the fact that the operator cost values are always estimated, or the true meaning of the cardinality numbers within some of the plan operators. These pitfalls can be very misleading, and they might lead you to spend your tuning effort in the wrong direction. By understanding these pitfalls and avoiding them, you can save a lot of time and effort. You’ll become a performance tuning hero by getting the slow queries to run faster – faster…

# Azure SQL DWH, from ingesting the data to providing analysis
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#623-Israel-2017)
Event Date: 27-04-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Leonid Ore
## Title: Azure SQL DWH, from ingesting the data to providing analysis
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DWH, from ingesting the data to providing analysis
Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a massively parallel processing (MPP) cloud-based, scale-out, relational database capable of processing massive volumes of data. It combines the power of Data Analysis appliance with the flexibility in resources of the cloud. 
Who should use it, Who shouldn’t and Who is already using it?
Transfer your data in from your own in-house systems and enrich your data with external sources from the public domain or cloud source and how about non-relational data. 
But what if we already have too much data and what we need is an Analytically processed and distilled information? How can we get intelligent decision based on all that data that we collected in our SQL Data warehouse?
All these and other related questions we’ll try to explore together… See you there.

# SQL Server Internals - Binary (Stored) format of the data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#623-Israel-2017)
Event Date: 27-04-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Ronen Ariely
## Title: SQL Server Internals - Binary (Stored) format of the data
## Abstract:
### There is a common confusion regarding "displayed format" and "stored format" of data using SQL Server. We can find lot of questions in the forums regarding "stored format" of dates, which are actually referring to the "displayed format", in external application. For example questions like: I am getting the error “DateTime data type resulted in an out-of-range value”, or questions like: “how can I change the DateTime column format in the database”.

In this session, we will explore how SQL Server actually stored the data behind the scene. 

We will read SQL Server data file directly using simple binary editor (notepad++), and we will explore the structure of several data types. We will focus on explore how DateTime2 data type is stored, which is probably one of the most common complex data type structure, and we will discuss other types in general (according to our time). During the demo, we are going to show and use several undocumented tools from different versions of SQL Server.

## Title: How to Setup and Manage a Corporate Self-Service Analytics Environment
## Abstract:
### As companies face the challenges arising from a surge in the number of customer interactions and data, it can be difficult to successfully manage the vast quantities of information and still provide a positive customer experience. It is incumbent upon businesses to create a consumer-centric experience that is powered by (predictive) analytics.

Adopting a data-driven approach through a corporate self-service analytics (SSA) environment is integral to strengthening your data and analytics strategy.

## Speaker: Jan Mulkens
## Title: Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft
## Abstract:
### In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.

Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.

These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists.
Should we be worried about fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data?

Using a combination of theory and demo’s, we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.
