## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: Introduction to Ensemble Modeling
## Abstract:
### Data vault is a compelling architecture for an enterprise data warehouse using SQL Server. We will review the basics about enterprise data warehouse design, introduce you to the data vault architecture and discuss how you can leverage BI features of SQL Server to help make your data warehouse solution provide maximum value to your users. We will walk through example data models to help highlight why data vault architecture facilitates traceability, auditability and scalability. Additionally we will cover implementation advantages which can facilitate agile development, strategies to load massive amounts of data in parallel, how to transition the data warehouse to a system of record, how to easily automate loading using BIML because of strictly naming rules and conventions, and finally how to support the Master Data Management needs of the organization.
