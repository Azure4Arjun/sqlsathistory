# Swimming in the Deep End with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-357)
Event Date: 07-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 1
## Speaker: Julie Smith
## Title: Swimming in the Deep End with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Many developers of all sorts get thrown into the deep end of the ETL pool without water wings with SSIS. While the dataflow and basic connections are easier to grok, the true complexity of SSIS often lies hidden in configurations, expressions, and parent child packages. This session is a primer on these lesser known, but frightfully important elements.

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues
## Abstract:
### Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

# Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance Using Wait Stats
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-357)
Event Date: 07-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 3
## Speaker: Jim Arko
## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance Using Wait Stats
## Abstract:
### Sometimes the hardest part of diagnosing performance issues is determining where to start. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just ask SQL Server what’s slowing it down? Good news: you can! Every single time SQL Server has to wait on a resource it keeps track of it in its Wait Stats. That valuable data can be used to narrow down your troubleshooting efforts and help you get to the root cause quicker. This session will provide an introduction to Wait Stats and explain how they can be leveraged to improve your performance tuning skills.

# Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 1 - The Theory and the Problems
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-357)
Event Date: 07-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 2
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 1 - The Theory and the Problems
## Abstract:
### This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive into all the problems that you'll run into when partitioning new or existing "Write Once, Read Many" tables, such as large Audit Tables, and how to code around them.  You'll also learn the methods to support three of the best reasons for partitioning such monster tables... MUCH shorter nightly index maintenance, MUCH shorter and smaller backups, and MUCH shorter "Get back in business" piecemeal restores.  We'll also learn how to do the "impossible"... compact a File Group (one per partition) so that there's virtually no unused space in the underlying file.  After all, we don't want to set any "free" disk-space to "Read Only".  Don't let the "Advanced" rating of this session scare you away.  Anyone with a decent handle on T-SQL (or wants one) will be able to understand this session because "all will be explained" and there will be oodles of well-documented code to back up the explanations.

## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 2 - Deep Dive on the Code
## Abstract:
### This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive on the code for the problems and desired results for partitioning things like the "Audit" Table covered in Part 1.  It's strongly recommended that you attend Part 1 where the groundwork for this session has been laid out.  In this session, we'll build a 4 million-row test table and do the initial partitioning.  We'll follow that up with the monthly process to re-index and compress the latest full partition automatically every month and do a deep dive on a view that makes monitoring partitions easy.  This code helped me reduce backups to 1/60th the amount of time that they used to take.  There's a ton of ancillary learning in the code, as well.  Don't let the "advanced" rating of this session scare you away because it's written for all levels to understand.

# Who Moved My Tuple--Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014.
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-357)
Event Date: 07-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 2
## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Who Moved My Tuple--Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014.
## Abstract:
### 
Data Warehouse workloads can be very large and taxing on your database server. With the modern demands of real-time analytics against growing volumes of data this challenge continues. When columnstore indexes and batch mode query processing were introduced in SQL Server 2012 were a performance game changer. In the 2012 implementation of columnstore, direct updating and inserting of data was not supported and other restrictions, such as data types limited the use of the feature. SQL 2014 removes those limitations—you can use a columnstore index as a clustered index, and more importantly directly perform DML against the index. Also, more query operators support batch mode, which means more of your queries can see performance benefits. You will understand the changes for 2014—and how having updateable columnstore indexes may cause changes to your process design. You will see the power of columnstore indexes in analytics, their limits, and how to include them into your system design.

# Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-357)
Event Date: 07-02-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Training 2
## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Speaker: Matt Nelson
## Title: Building dynamic SSIS packages for more flexibility
## Abstract:
### After building a handful of SSIS packages, you probably want to have more flexibility to make the package execution more dynamic.  In this session, we will learn how to use  variables, expressions, and loops to do things like: extract data to a file with *today's* date in the file name, load all files in a directory at the same time, and loop through a set of servers to gather data.  For this session, you should already be familiar with how to create SSIS packages to load data from flat files and extract data to flat files.

## Title: Top 5 Ways to Improve Your triggers
## Abstract:
### You've got a piece of code that you want to implement as a trigger, but you've read that triggers can grind your performance to a halt.
