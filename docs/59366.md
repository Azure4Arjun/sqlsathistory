## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.
