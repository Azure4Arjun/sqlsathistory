## Speaker: Ken Puls
## Title: Make your data mobile with Power BI
## Abstract:
### As amazing as our Power BI reports and dashboards are, they are designed for a full sized web page, not the smaller mobile phone screen.  In this session Ken will walk through the process of taking a regular Power BI report and then optimizing both the report and dashboard for mobile consumption, all with tools built in to the Power BI ecosystem.  Weâ€™ll look at changing layouts, location filtering, setting alerts, annotations and more!
