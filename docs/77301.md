## Speaker: Kevin Chant
## Title: Choose your own Database Adventure
## Abstract:
### Based on real life scenarios, in this audience interactive session we will go through some scenarios you might encounter whilst dealing with SQL Server databases and you will be provided with some options about what to do. Members of the audience will then select from these options what to do and we will follow that path and see what the outcome is from there.

Each selection will have a different outcome, and along the way you will probably learn some new things.
