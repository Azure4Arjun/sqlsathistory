## Title: How you can use disconnected tables in PowerPivot/Tabular models to solve real world problems
## Abstract:
### When people first start out with Power Pivot/Tabular data models, the first thing they learn is how to create "one to many" relationships between tables.  But did you know it is quite valid to load tables into your data model that are "disconnected"?

In this session I introduce 4 real world scenarios that demonstrate how you can use the power of DAX disconnected tables to solve business problems.  The scenarios are:
* Allow users to perform what if analysis and change the calculation values in a pivot table by altering the input values for key variables using a slicer.
* Allow users to change the series that is displayed on a chart using input from a slicer.
* Grouping you customers into age groups so you can create cohorts for reporting and analysis using "banding"
* Displaying the "latest survey result" in a Pivot Table for any date selected.  It is very easy to see the "results" for a period using Power Pivot/Tabular. But it is much harder to find the "latest " from any period.
