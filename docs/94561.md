## Title: Embedding Power BI in your application
## Abstract:
### Power BI is great tool and reports we made are always beautiful and catchy, right? But sometimes forcing users to open their browser to go to Power BI Service web site isn't so nice. In this session we will explore the various ways to embed Power BI reports, dashboards and tiles. We will learn what is needed to do this, what it will costs us (can we do it for free?) and what architecture decisions must be taken to build an embedded solution.
