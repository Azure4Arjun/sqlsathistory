## Title: Matching with Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### Matching is the identification of rows which are likely duplicates and is the less well known feature of Data Quality Services.  Join me in showing Matching some love.  We'll go over the creation of matching rules, how to use the rules with matching activity projects and also work a bit with Master Data Services and the Excel add ins for MDS and DQS.
