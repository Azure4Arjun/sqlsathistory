## Speaker: Rick Krueger
## Title: Rules of Engagement: NoSQL is SQL Server's Ally
## Abstract:
### When should you favor a NoSQL store over SQL Server, or consider polyglot persistence? In military and police operations, the rules of engagement determine when, where, and how force shall be used. As the “data police”, we are responsible for determining when, where, and how data is stored. As SQL Server professionals, it tends to be our first choice, even when there are other data storage options that are a ‘more natural’ fit. In this session, Rick and Dave will start with the NoSQL basics, and then dive into the different categories of NoSQL stores while explaining what each type is well suited for. (Pair Presented with Dave Valentine @IngeniousSQL)
