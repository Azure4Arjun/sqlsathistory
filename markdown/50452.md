## Title: Creating Cross-Platform Mobile Applications with Xamarin
## Abstract:
### We are quickly moving towards becoming a mobile first world and you don't want to be left behind. Leverage your vast .NET knowledge and learn how to build mobile apps on the .NET stack with Xamarin. Recently acquired by Microsoft, Xamarin allows you to build native, fast, beautiful cross-platform mobile applications in C# (or even F#). In this session we will go over the basics of creating a mobile application using Xamarin.Forms, utilizing C# to build a real-world application using a single shared codebase. We will also cover the latest from Build and Evolve, looking at the latest changes from Microsoft/Xamarin and what they will mean for you. This session expects that you have an understanding of the C# language and .NET development.
