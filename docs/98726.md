## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Python Pipeline Primer: Data Engineering with Azure DataBricks
## Abstract:
### Azure DataBricks brings a PaaS offering of Apache Spark, which allows for blazing fast data processing, interactive querying and hosting of ML models all in one place! Most of the buzz is around Data Science  AI - what about the humble data engineer who wants to harness the in-memory processing power within their ETL pipelines?

This session focuses on Azure DataBricks as your data ingestion, transformation and curation tool of choice. We will:

	• Introduce the DataBricks service  why we use Python
	• Discuss the hosting  compute options available
	• Demonstrate a sample data processing task
	• Compare against alternative approaches using SSIS, U-SQL and HDInsight
	• Demonstrate pipeline management  orchestration
	• Review the wider architectures and extension patterns
	• Compare and contrast to new Azure Data Factory Data Flows

The session is aimed at Data Engineers seeking to put the Azure DataBricks technology in the right context and learn how to use the service.
