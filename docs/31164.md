## Title: A Comparison of SQL Server and Oracle
## Abstract:
### Today, more often than not, an organization runs on both SQL Server and Oracle databases.
 
Both SQL Server and Oracle often implement comparible features, backup recovery, high availability, security etc.
It makes sense for DBAs to be familiar with the best practice concepts, armed with knowledge of the both worlds.

In this session, I will present SQL Server and Oracle side-by-side for a comparison of similarity and differences on most popular and useful aspects. 

It is assumed the audience already have some good SQL Server knowledge, but with little or none Oracle exposure.
