## Title: Build your own Virtual Lab
## Abstract:
### If you don't have the chance to work on different kinds of projects, it may be tough to grow all the necessary skills to further your career. By building a virtual lab at home, you can take control of the situation.

This session will focus on setting up a basic network environment using VirtualBox, free (downloadable) software, and your home computer. It's aimed towards individuals that aren't afraid to modify server settings or use the command line. This session is focused mainly on virtualization and networking topics, and not so much on SQL Server. However, you'll be in the position to tackle larger projects, such as SQL Server clustering or Availability Groups, once complete.
