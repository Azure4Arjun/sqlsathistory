# SQLSaturday #406 - Kharkiv 2015
Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Database development
## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Common TSQL Mistakes
## Abstract:
### We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over SEVENTY times now and it is always very highly rated!
