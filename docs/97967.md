## Title: Speed up your data models using Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Azure Analysis Services is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that hosts Tabular Models in the cloud. The same capabilities with on-premise SSAS Tabular Models are applied to this new version. Benefits to running Azure AS is the ability to scale up\down, pause, and resume on demand. In this session we will build a semantic data model, migrate to Azure, and visualize using Power BI. If you are running Tabular Models that are compatibility level 1200 and higher this session will show you how quick and easy it is to migrate to Azure.
