Learn to improve your performance tuning process by using several free tools. This session will cover wait stats, dynamic management objects, perfmon, PAL, SQL Trace, ClearTrace, SQL Nexus and SQLDiag. 

This session assumes some knowledge of code tuning and performance tuning and general knowledge about performance counters and SQL Server traces.
