## Title: Data Quality Services Approach to Cleansing
## Abstract:
### Learn about Microsoft’s Data Quality Services (DQS), what it is and how it works. We'll show you how DQS sets itself apart from conventional data cleansing routines that we’re used and go through examples on how to begin your own Data Quality Project. But what really makes DQS unique and powerful is its ability to access shared knowledge. In this presentation, we will also go through how to access and use that shared knowledge.
