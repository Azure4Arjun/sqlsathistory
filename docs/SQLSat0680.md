## Title: Data Modeling for the Modern Enterprise
## Abstract:
### This session is theoretical with a focus on the many ways that we can model data. We will discuss why we select one modeling technique over the other in different user scenarios. These different scenarios will vary by industry and company, two main scenarios include: purchasing a product and storing the data related to the sales transaction, or visualizing the total sales for a product, month over month, for the calendar year 2016. Diagrams will be used to explain these different models and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion. Demos using IDERA ER/Studio Data Architect will be used to conclude the presentation.

# Remote SQL Server Troubleshooting and Monitoring Using SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#680-Kansas-City-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Don St. Cyr
## Title: Remote SQL Server Troubleshooting and Monitoring Using SSIS
## Abstract:
### We have over 3500 remote installations of SQL Server and only 3 DBAs to find and resolve issues. While some installations need daily examination others operate for months without any attention at all.
We needed a system to keep a light, revolving set of data that we could quickly pull back and analyze when issues were escalated to us.
This system also had to be modular so we could add or remove  queries, as needed, while always keeping the data fresh.
In this session I'll use Glenn Berry's diagnostic queries and SSIS to show how we collect and store data on our remote systems. When problems arise we download the data and use Powershell to digest it into a simple report.

## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.
 
We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.

# Don't just code it—Generate It
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#680-Kansas-City-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Kevin Mackey
## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
## Abstract:
### Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

# Working with Temporal Data in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#680-Kansas-City-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: David Maxwell
## Title: Working with Temporal Data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. SQL Server has long offered solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables, though those aren’t always the best solutions for each situation. SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to work with tables for each kind of solution, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples. Attendees will leave with a fundamental understanding of practical use cases for different types of temporal tables.

Dynamic SQL has both pros and cons to it's design, but can also be a helpful tool. This presentation will walk through the steps of building dynamic tables, aggregating data in a pivot format and give you the first steps of writing a Dynamic Query. There are hundreds of task that will benefit from the use of Dynamic SQL.  From parameter based searches to building dynamic SELECT statements at run time.

## Title: Make Power BI Your Own with the Power BI APIs
## Abstract:
### Power BI makes accessing data from various sources and building advanced visualizations for analytics easy to do. Behind the scenes Power BI is built on standard technologies and APIs that allow it to be customized in multiple ways to fit in with your environment the way you need it to. In this session we will walk though samples and demos that show how you can extend Power BI with custom visualizations, access custom data sources, embed various Power BI elements in your applications, and be able to push your data into a Power BI report/dashboard. Each of these items take advantage of the Power BI APIs in different ways and we will discuss each and provide the code samples for you to take back and get a head start. This session will be showing code to access the Power BI REST API using C# and NodeJS along with some M for accessing and manipulating custom data sources.

# Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory

## Speaker: Meagan Longoria
## Title: Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Although SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Azure Data Factory (ADF) are both used for data management processes in the Microsoft Data Platform, they are rather different tools. SSIS performs data transformation and requires a SQL Agent job or another application to schedule and execute it. ADF is an orchestration tool rather than a data transformation tool, and it has built-in scheduling capabilities. I'll explain the basics of Azure Data Factory, show how it is and isn't like SSIS, and share lessons learned from ADF projects I have completed.

## Speaker: Rob Kraft
## Title: Security Developers Need To Know
## Abstract:
### In this session I will list the things that developers need to do to minimize the risk that a hacker can gain access to a database.  I will discuss each in depth and provide examples of a good code and practices to keep hackers out.  The list includes: protecting connection strings, using minimal database permissions, funneling all database code through central logging and injection testing filters, proper use of stored procedures, hashing passwords, and SQL injection prevention.  I believe that when developers write a properly architected application, they can be confident that risks of database injection through the application is minimized.

# How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#680-Kansas-City-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
## Abstract:
### You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.
