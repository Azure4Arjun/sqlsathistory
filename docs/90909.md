## Speaker: Scott Stauffer
## Title: Can Scott create a mobile app in an hour using PowerApps?
## Abstract:
### Scott isn't a rocket scientist… far from it… he will shy away from .NET development ANY chance he can get!  PowerApps, part of Microsoft's Power Platform, allow the knowledgeable information worker to develop in a "Low Code/No Code" environment.  Sure, there are expressions to control logic in PowerApps, but if you can handle writing excel formulas, I'm sure you'll be just fine.  Watch Scott sweat on stage as he builds a responsive application in the cloud and push it down to his iPhone, store and retrieve data from an enterprise data solution, and take a bow… (or scrunch up into a fetal position and never step on stage again… )
