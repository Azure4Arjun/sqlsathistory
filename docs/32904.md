## Title: Women In Technology Panel Discussion
## Abstract:
### Increasing the role of women in technology has a direct impact on the women working in hi-tech, but the effects can go far beyond that. How do female tech workers influence innovation and product development? How do men benefit from having more women working in technology? Can the presence of women in tech affect a companyâ€™s bottom line? What does it mean for women and their families when they have access to hi-tech jobs? This session is open to both men and women. The panelists will present brief remarks and then the floor will be open for the audience to ask questions of the panelists.
