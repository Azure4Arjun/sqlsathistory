## Speaker: Nico Jacobs
## Title: Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning plays a central role in Cortana Intelligence: discovering useful patterns in all the collected data is essential in advanced analytics.
To get started with Azure machine learning you don't need to be  an expert: Microsoft provides ready made models that can be used immediately (Cognitive Services). For other business problems (e.g. churn) Microsoft provides a template, but we need to tune this template to our business data. And for some analysis problems we need to build machine learning solutions from scratch.
In this demo-oriented session you will see demonstrations of these three ways of working with Machine Learning in the Azure cloud.
