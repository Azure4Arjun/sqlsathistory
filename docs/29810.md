## Title: Oh Cluster, My Cluster!
## Abstract:
### Clustering is a black box to many DBAs. Often, the IT dept configures  installs the SQL cluster then turns it over to DBAs to deploy databases and set up backup  maintenance plans. The problem is when things go wrong the DBAs are reliant on the IT dept when their time is better spent working on other things. The goal of this session is to discuss underlying aspects of SQL Server clustering. We will touch on OS and SQL Server issues as well as how it reacts differently being clustered vs non-clustered. We will also discuss the pitfalls of upgrading clustered databases and installing clusters from scratch including lessons learned from a real-world upgrade of a SQL Server cluster where the active and passive nodes are 1,200 miles apart!
