## Title: ETL: Avoiding Costly Mistakes
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will review a list of costly mistakes we make when designing and building ETL and data integration processes, and provide with actionable recommendations to avoid them. You will get a check-list you can use in your projects to ensure the ETL processes include the capabilities a solid data integration sub-system should have and you will be better prepared to assess the robustness and reliability of ETL solutions.
