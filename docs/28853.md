## Title: Take Control of Your Databases with PBM!
## Abstract:
### A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing their policies and procedures to ensure that their systems are consistent and in many cases compliant with certain governmental requirements. SQL Server 2008 provides Policy Based Management (PBM) as a tool for the DBA to manage system policies in a very structured way. In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features to help lower your anxiety levels while increasing your systemâ€™s availability. We'll also learn how you can leverage the PBM system across not only your 2008 environment but also all those down-level instances as well!
