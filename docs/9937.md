## Title: BI Basics - Finding Return on Data
## Abstract:
### This session will you chart the waters through the sea of Business Intelligence (BI) options.  IT departments need tools to turn data into useful information for users.  Instead of ROI, this session talks about Return on Data' for IT Managers.  

In this session we look at the roles of data warehousing, big data and business intelligence systems.  The Microsoft BI stack has evolved from traditional OLAP cubes to include tabular models, PowerBI, integration with HADOOP, reporting tools and full integration with SharePoint.  This session is non-technical.
