## Title: Database Development and Automation with SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### Despite SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) being available in one form or another since 2007, many organizations still juggle hand-coded scripts to do database upgrades. In it's modern form, SSDT helps bring the same processes, controls and tools to Database Development that Application developers have been enjoying for ages.  This talk will provide an overview of SSDTâ€™s features and show you how to get started using it to save time, implement better code controls, automate builds and deployments, apply DevOps concepts to Database Development and be a better DBA or database developer.
