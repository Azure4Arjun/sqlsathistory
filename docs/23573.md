## Title: "Faster than the speed of light"... with #MSBI
## Abstract:
### What-if insights from your business data were just a few seconds/clicks away? What-if we could instantly explore our data with rich  fully interactive dashboards using the amazing new features of Excel 2013, PowerPivot and PowerView? Without needing to build auxiliary reference tables, complex dax or powerpivot modelling? What-if instead self-service we could be "instantly-served"?
