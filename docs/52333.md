## Title: Be a DBA Army of One
## Abstract:
### Your team does all the SQL Server maintenance and auditing, but it really shouldn't take quite so much time. It would be nice to get on that new project that's coming up in Q3, or study up on SQL 2016, right?  
You definitely need MinionWare: Minion Backup, Minion Reindex, and Minion Enterprise.
Minion Backup and Minion Reindex are FREE standalone solutions for SQL Server backup and index maintenance. Each module has a simple installation, extensive logging, and multi-level configuration options. 
 
Our flagship product, Minion Enterprise (or as we call it, "ME"), is the SQL Server management solution you've been looking for.  ME lets you see your entire enterprise from a single location. It easily answers questions like, "What are the service accounts for all the production servers? Who has sysadmin access to any server? How how much disk space will I need to add to the QA servers next year? Are there any databases that haven't had a full backup this week?"
