## Title: Columnstore Indexes and Data Warehouses
## Abstract:
### Columnstore indexes are one of the most exciting new features available in the next release of SQL Server 2012. Combined with new query processing algorithms, columnstore indexes are designed to improve the performance of data warehouses queries by several orders of magnitude providing more business value by allowing users to interactively explore the data. This session explains how columnstore indexes improve the performance of data warehouse queries—focusing on the query processing and optimization aspect of the technology—and identifies limitations of the current product release.
