## Speaker: Laerte Junior
## Title: How to properly gather performance counter data using Windows PowerShell
## Abstract:
### We DBA´s know how important it is to collect performance data. In this session, I will show to you how to properly use the native Get-Counter PowerShell cmdlet to get all information you need from your servers. It has never been as easy to collect performance counter data and save it to a CSV file or a SQL Server table for baselining and later analysis. You may be thinking "But I don’t know nothing about PowerShell and explicitly using .NET classes in my code". Don’t worry; you don’t need to know this to collect counters. Although this is a 100-level session, you’ll be producing 400-level results and your scripts will scale as the number of servers increase, because we’ll use asynchronous collection and processing. And better yet, we’ll schedule all of it. All this using native PowerShell cmdlets and a minimal amount of script code.

## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
## Abstract:
### Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

See what happens in a data file when you convert a table from a heap to a clustered index! See fragmentation and the havoc wrought by Shrink! Marvel at the behavior of multiple files and filegroups! Index Rebuilds! Eureka!

## Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.

## Title: When Cluster and Virtualization Aren't Enough: How to Create an Application Availability Framework
## Abstract:
### Join us for a talk on how to create an application availability framework for any SQL Server implementation. Clustering and virtualization solved some of the issues around high availability, but then these "infrastructure-up" approaches raised new challenges, including rigid configuration rules and restrictions, expensive software stacks, and complex operational models. In this webinar, we'll show you how you can focus on what matters most- your applications. Whether or not your environment already uses virtualization or clustering, this webinar will show you how to create an application availability framework that provides heterogeneous instance mobility from anything to anything, anywhere - truly physical, virtual, OS,  SQL Server version agnostic. Ready for a new approach to assured availability? Attend this talk to learn how.

## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR
## Abstract:
### These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.

## Speaker: Adam Machanic
## Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Clash of the Row Goals
## Abstract:
### The fight for better performance is a battle of wits: your mind, your intelligence, and your honor pitted against the less-than-dependable whims of the Query Optimizer. But alas, the arbitrary rewrites and clunky hints leveraged by most developers to get around optimization deficiencies make things feel less like a proper duel and more like a skirmish at the sandbox. To truly engage your enemy you must comprehend his inner workings, and in the case of the Query Optimizer, that means you must delve into the mysteries of "row goals." These internal metrics are tracked and enforced within Top iterators--and they exhibit a considerable amount of influence over plan shape and flow, both at compile time and as your query runs. Attend this session to learn how to take charge of optimization, expertly mold your query plans, and gain a new set of tools for eliminating bottlenecks in even your most complex problem queries. En garde!
