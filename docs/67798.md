## Title: Master your Data in the Cloud with Power Apps and Logic Apps
## Abstract:
### As data warehouses become more advanced and move to the cloud, Master Data Management is often bottom of the list. Being tied to an IAAS server solely for MDS feels like a big step in the wrong direction! In this session, I will show you the secret of â€˜app-iness with a cloud alternative which leverages Power Apps and Logic Apps. We will step through a number of real world scenarios, demonstrating how easy it is to deliver a mobile friendly, no-server, no-code Master Data Management solution.
