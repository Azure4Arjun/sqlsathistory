## Title: Back to Basics - Threading in .NET
## Abstract:
### Multi-core processors are becoming pretty prevalent for most business user's workstations these days. This trend has increased the benefits for developer's to take advantage of multiple threads in applications. While not every application will benefit from being multi-threaded this programming tool should be in every .NET developers tool belt. Unfortunately in my experience the majority of .NET developers are not comfortable with this programming paradigm and are afraid to ask. This session dives into the basics behind threads, outlines all the different threading options in .NET, and then walks through programming examples using .NET 2.0 and 4.0.
