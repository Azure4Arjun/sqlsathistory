## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop?
## Abstract:
### ver the years, one of the most common questions I am asked is, "How can I configure a cluster on my machine?" Ask no more! Production should never be the only place you have clusters. Having the ability to create a cluster that you can use as a sandbox for testing or as an instruction tool for presentations and demonstrations is something every DBA should have in their arsenal.This session will demystify the "magic" behind configuring a cluster on your laptop or desktop using either Vmware Workstation or Microsoft's Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2, and show how to configure things like the virtual machines, the domain controller, and the iSCSI storage solution.

Event Date: 26-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Virtualization and SAN Basics for DBAs
## Abstract:
### These two technologies can make a very big – and very bad – difference in how your SQL Server performs. Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the real, honest lowdown from a virtualization administrator, a SAN administrator, and a DBA? Wouldn’t it be even better if one person had done all three, and could give you the pros and cons of each point of view? That person is Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master who’s been there and done that.

# Do You Know the Data Flow?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#65---Vancouver-2011)
Event Date: 26-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Do You Know the Data Flow?
## Abstract:
### The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.

# Processing Flat Files with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#65---Vancouver-2011)
Event Date: 26-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
## Abstract:
### When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#65---Vancouver-2011)
Event Date: 26-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Kendra Little
## Title: No More Bad Dates: Using Temporal Data Wisely
## Abstract:
### Temporal data can be confusing in SQL Server. It's no wonder: there are six data types for storing these values. In this session we'll discuss dates, times, and how they are stored internally. We'll talk about how to select a temporal data type and common issues with some types. We'll compare performance of different methods for computing temporal values. We'll also take a look at gotchas in features of SQL Server for which date and time data type choices can be critical. Choose wisely: the correct type and high performing data access logic will help your applications scale and save development and administrative time.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.
