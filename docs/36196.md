## Title: Data-ing Advice: Profiles are Important
## Abstract:
### Data warehousing professionals often consider data profiling to be drudgery and/or an unnecessary part of the larger warehouse design process.  However, information unearthed during this process can prove instrumental in avoiding pitfalls later on.  This session will explore the reasons for profiling and scenarios in which it proves particularly useful.  We will also discuss profiling methods, including the SSIS profiling task and supplemental profiling techniques that provide both developers and business users insight into the quality and consistency of source data.
