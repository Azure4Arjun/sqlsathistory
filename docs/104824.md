## Title: DevOps for Databases: 10 steps to failure
## Abstract:
### Application teams have been drinking the DevOps ‘Kool-aid’ for many years (19 to be precise) and the benefits are undeniably positive. We’ve seen improvements to code quality, faster, more reliable deployments as a result. And yet…many of us assume that because databases are different, they don’t fit this model…didn’t our parents tell us never to assume?

In this session, we’ll use reverse psychology to evidence the steps that will inevitably cause us to fail database DevOps - so we can avoid it!
By knowing what to NOT do, the path becomes clearer, leading your business and your career to a higher ground.
