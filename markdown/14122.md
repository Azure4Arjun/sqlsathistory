## Title: Develop a Quick and Dirty Web interface to your DB
## Abstract:
### Develop a Quick and Dirty Web interface to your database: for the DBA and other non-developers. So you want to develop to your database? Do you have your own tools to check performance? Does Chris Shaw's Utility Database sound like a tool you have and want a web interface, but donâ€™t want to write a lot of code? I will demonstrate how a simple ASP.Net MVC site can be developed and deployed against your database. See firsthand how easy we can use Shaw's utility database and access across the web over a mobile device so you may manage performance online whilst zipping your drink of choice.
