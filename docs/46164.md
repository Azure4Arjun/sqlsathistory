## Title: Inside and out of Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication in SQL Server is great tool for scaling out your application's primary database(s) workload onto other servers with near real-time data propagation. In this session, I will cover data replication tricks-of-the-trade to offload work from your primary database onto other replicated servers. I will show you custom and traditional replication monitoring techniques and performance profiles that you can use to improve your performance and monitoring of your existing replication installations or gain new knowledge and confidence to implement replication for your company. I will also cover how AlwaysOn Availability Groups differs and why I sometimes still choose transactional replication for scaling SQL Server.
