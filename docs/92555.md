## Title: Raspberry Pi and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### You spend all your time working in the software world on a computer, where everything you do happens inside a virtual machine, inside a data center that you can never visit. Wouldn't it be fun to bring some of that into the physical world?

Come see some examples of how to connect SQL Server with the Raspberry Pi. We can make a noise when a job is done running. We can show a gauge of the system activity. We can even push a button to start T-SQL code running.
