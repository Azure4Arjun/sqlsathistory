## Title: Knowledge Mapping-Sharing the Wealth of Your Team's Expertise
## Abstract:
### Picture this: Employee A left your company after working there for 5 years. Employee A was a jack of all trades. They created some processes, participated on committees, and overall had great business knowledge. Employee B gets hired, and is looking for information to be effective in their role. Unfortunately Employee A's knowledge and how to's of daily tasks went undocumented. It has become challenging to reach Employee A to inquire about these things. 

Organizational survival depends on many things, and one of the critical things it depends on is the flow and exchange of knowledge of business practices. Knowledge mapping is an activity that outlines business tasks critical to organizational life, the people responsible, required resources, outputs, and inputs. This session will inform participants about the purpose of knowledge mapping, the process, how to capture knowledge, and how to support a successful knowledge management initiative.
