## Title: "Extra Eyes" for Monitoring SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Are all your databases backed up?  Has SQL reported any errors? Are there critical Windows or SQL patches you need to apply?  Are all of your SQL Servers configured to Microsoft "Best Practices"?  This sessions shows how Microsoft Atlanta Tool can be used to provide the CIO or DBA an "extra set of eyes" to check the health of your SQL Severs.
