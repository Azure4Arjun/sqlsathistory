## Title: (NOLOCK) FOR YESFUN: Games with Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### Understanding transaction isolation levels is critical for developing concurrent software as well as administering databases. Unfortunately most of us learn about transaction isolation early in our careers and don't maintain an in-depth knowledge of different isolation levels. This talk will help! We'll cover all isolation levels and discuss problems and benefits. A broadsheet handout will keep your knowledge fresh later on. This is suitable for developers and DBAs at all levels.
