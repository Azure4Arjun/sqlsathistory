## Title: Setting up BI Infrastructure: Points to consider
## Abstract:
### Imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors by the users: Better access to data and increased operational efficiency. 
We shall discuss selection of vendors and technology. We will learn about various components of BI infrastructure, their HA/DR scenarios. We shall also learn about the best practices involved therein. We will also discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves. 
We will also briefly discuss how Copy Data Virtualization helps us to provide data/information quickly to the BI team to turn around reports quickly.  
Evolution of the cloud has really changed the lay of the BI land. We will talk about On-Prem, cloud hosted or hybrid solutions. We will take a quick look at the Power BI where the Power of BI is back in the hands of the users.
At the end of the session you will have a complete information about an ideal BI Infrastructure.
