## Title: Introduction to PowerShell for the DBA
## Abstract:
### One goal of a DBA is to automate gathering information such as the specifications of all of your SQL Servers. In this session we will show you the basics of the PowerShell language. Then we will move on to how you can use PowerShell to go through a list of servers and grab information like the processor specs, check if the machine is a virtual image, memory size, SQL version, etc. and produce a formatted Excel file with the information.
