## Title: Tabular Analysis Services 2019 from Start to Finish
## Abstract:
### This is a start to finish session on developing an enterprise analytical database with Analysis Services 2017 (SSAS) Tabular Model. The session will provide an introduction to Analysis Services and why it should be used. The rest of the time will be spent in live demonstrations building an analytical database.  The session will start with a blank project and show the steps for data sources and data sets. The data modeling will include relationships and hierarchies. The DAX language will be used to create measures including a Key Performance Indicator. The more advanced examples will include a many to many relationship as well as a slowly changing dimension table. The reporting will be throughout the session using Excel PivotTables/Chart as well as Power BI.
