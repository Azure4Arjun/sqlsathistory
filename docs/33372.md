It provides for declarative style of approaching updates in a collaborative environment. This tool has been undergone significant enhancements recently and has many compelling features. We'll view some the key functional areas of the tool, discuss best practices, and take a look at what features companies could take advantage of.

VSDB is free to download for use with Visual Studio 2008 Developer and Team Suite Edition.  It is also included as part of the Visual Studio 2010 Premium edition.
