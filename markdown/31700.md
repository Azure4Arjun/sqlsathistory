## Title: Working with spatial data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Lots of devices can give positions and instead of just storing those in a Latitude and Longitude fields in your database you could be using the Geography data type that SQL Server provides. You can even store more complex shapes like zip code boundaries. We will learn how to fill these, how to work with them, how to index these with spatial indexes and how to use the spatial indexes effectively.
