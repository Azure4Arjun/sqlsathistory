## Title: The ABCs of SSIS
## Abstract:
### This presentation shows the basics of SSIS to help with automating database tasks, such as maintenance, importing and exporting data, or ETL transactions.  The discussion will start with an understanding of when SSIS should be used vs. when a database object, such as a view or stored procedure, should be used.  You will also see how to create a basic package, and how to use the built-in logging and configurations.  Lastly, we will talk about the different ways SSIS is used, based on the role of the person using it and the importance of organizing the overall SSIS structure.
