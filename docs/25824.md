## Speaker: Stuart Moore
## Title: PowerShell for the curious SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA you've probably noticed more and more talk of PowerShell over the last few years. You might have never used it, or perhaps you've even downloaded a few scripts to use, or started reading a tutorial, but aren't really sure what it can do for you?

Then this session is for you. Trying something new for SQL Saturday Exter 2014, this "session" is in fact 2 sessions long (don't worry, you'll still get a break for coffee half way through). 

By the end of them you should have a better understanding of what PowerShell is, and how it can be used with SQL Server, so you can  start writing your own scripts or have a better understanding of how a script you've downloaded works

Session 1 will be a easy high level introduction
