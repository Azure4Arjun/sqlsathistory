## Title: Making Predictions with Microsoft Data Mining Tool
## Abstract:
### Whether predicting customers, All Stars or concert set lists, the process and the tools remain the same.  Microsoftâ€™s Analysis Services Data Mining tools enable you to quickly profile your data, identify hidden relationships and predict future outcomes based on those relationships.   Join me to see what data mining is, what data mining is not and how Microsoft's data mining tools can help you analyze your business.  During this session, I will walk us through a start-to-finish data mining prediction project.  It's easier than you might have thought.
