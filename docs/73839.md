## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: Introduction To Azure Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure Cosmos DB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to create a Cosmos DB instance in Azure, how to work with JSON documents, create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript. Finally, I will compare performance and feature difference between SQL Server 2016 and Azure Cosmos DB.
