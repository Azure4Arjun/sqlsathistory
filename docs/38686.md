## Title: Azure Sql DataWarehouse - The First cloud enterprise solution for MPP
## Abstract:
### Azure Sql Datawarehouse is the first cloud enterprise solution for Multiple Parallel Process.
But how it works ? Why is it so fast ?
Data warehouses require fixed combinations of storage and compute, often underutilizing expensive resources. With SQL Data Warehouse, data and compute scale independently. You can dynamically deploy, grow, shrink, and even pause compute, taking advantage of best-in-class price/performance. Additionally, SQL Data Warehouse utilizes the power and familiarity of T-SQL to easily integrate query results across relational data in your data warehouse and non-relational data in Azure blob storage.
