## Title: Building your ETL Framework with BIML
## Abstract:
### BIML makes SSIS development faster and creates reusable modules that help you apply a consistent ETL framework across solutions. In this session, we will write BIML and use it to build an SSIS package. You'll see how BIML allows you to avoid corrupted metadata and the tedious repetition of implementing simple SSIS patterns, freeing you up to take on new and interesting ETL challenges. Then we will review how to use it to create an extensible ETL framework.
