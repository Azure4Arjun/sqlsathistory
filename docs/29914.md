## Title: Service Broker - Why, When and Where?
## Abstract:
### Messages, Queues, Contracts, Services, Routes, Endpoints, Transport and Dialog securityâ€¦What could be easier to understand? While complexity of implementation is one of the factors that make us afraid of using service broker there is another one - we often don't recognize the use cases where service broker would benefit a system.

This session focuses on the latter case. While it provides very high level overview of Service Broker Architecture, the goal of this presentation is to discuss WHEN to use Service Broker. This session outlines several service broker-friendly patterns and shows a few examples based on real life Service Broker implementations in both centralized and distributed systems.
