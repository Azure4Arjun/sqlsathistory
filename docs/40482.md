## Title: Dynamic SQL, not so scary?
## Abstract:
### A look at how dynamic SQL can be used in BAU tasks as a tool and also its use in applications.

I will be looking at the specific example of an application runtime need to import all or a subset of database objects tables, views, functions, procedures, triggers from one database to another.

I will also look at how to store the result of a SQL select into a .NET Data Table object and then to XML and then the reverse of picking up the XML and then recreating the dataset back to SQL.
