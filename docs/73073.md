## Title: Using SQL  PowerPivot In Excel to create a SSAS Tabular Model for Power BI
## Abstract:
### PowerPivot is a quick and powerful tool that can be used to create an SSAS Tabular Model.  In this session, I will use Power Query to connect to data sources in SQL, build a data model using Power Pivot in Excel and demonstrate how to move the data model into SSAS Tabular.  We will also look at Power Update, which is a tool that can be used to schedule a PowerPivot workbook update and restore to an SSAS Tabular Model.  Finally, we can see how we can connect to our SSAS Tabular Model and begin using our SSAS Tabular Model in Power BI  in Excel.
