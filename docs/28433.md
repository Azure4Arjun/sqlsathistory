## Title: Securing an SSAS, SSRS, and SharePoint BI Solution
## Abstract:
### Security is a vital part of any business intelligence solution. Unfortunately, creating a solution that presents users only with the information they should see can be a challenge. In this session we’ll look at how the various security pieces come together to make the solution work. We’ll cover configuring Kerberos for securing SSRS, SSAS, and SharePoint; Scripting permissions in SSAS using MDX, Active Directory groups, and SSIS; and finally, configuring SharePoint, PerformancePoint services, and Power Pivot services to access user’s data by passing Windows credentials and/or the use of data sources with execution accounts.
