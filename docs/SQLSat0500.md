# XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Adam Belebczuk
## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

# Designing SQL Server HA/DR Infrastructure to meet the SLA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Designing SQL Server HA/DR Infrastructure to meet the SLA
## Abstract:
### Once you agreed to an SLA for the databases you manage its time to deliver on this promise
This session will show how to select from the many HA/DR features you have in SQL Server to pick the ones that will help you meet the SLA and most important will tell you how you must combine them to be successful.
For each one of the solutions we discuss we will define a series of failure modes and then check if the solution actually can fulfill the SLA as promised or if it needs more

# Virtual SQL Servers, Actual Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Virtual SQL Servers, Actual Performance
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance are discussed, and the knowledge gained can help you work with your infrastructure engineers so that you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes are demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

# Getting Started with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

# Architecting Availability Groups
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Derik Hammer
## Title: Architecting Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### You are a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts, and now you are considering AlwaysOn Availability Groups. This session will cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of AlwaysOn Availability Groups; stand-alone instances, fail-over cluster instances, multi-subnet, and a hybrid approach that I call disaster-recovery-on-the-cheap. It will also include their exclusive features such as read-only routing and backup off-loading. In addition, you'll learn how to use the Availability Group Listener correctly and why you should be using Windows Server 2012 R2 or above, along with some of my own personal lessons learned.

# DAX and the tabular model
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: DAX and the tabular model
## Abstract:
### With the advent of the tabular model in SQL Server 2012, another analytical option has opened to the BI Specialist. We shall be looking at what critical factors should be analyzed prior to opting for the model and that done,  how to extract data from a tabular model using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
We shall discuss many of the often used functions, discuss their 'overloads' (utilizing several practical examples) and see how to turn the extracted data into valuable information that may be used by decision makers to help the enterprise achieve its corporate goals.

# Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV): The Antipattern too Great to Give Up
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andrew Novick
## Title: Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV): The Antipattern too Great to Give Up
## Abstract:
### The Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) is a design pattern for relational databases that uses an extreme form of normalization to achieve flexibility and the ability to efficiently store temporal data that changes frequently.  EAV has its critics and the flexibility it provides creates opportunities for abuse and introduction of bugs leading some to call it an Antipattern.

In many applications the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and EAV has been in use for 50 years in a variety of applications such as Medical Research, Financial Services and e-Commerce.   This presentation will discuss:

•	What is Entity-Attribute-Value and show variations including temporal variations
•	What are the problems with EAV
•	How to handle the problems and reduce the chance of introducing bugs
•	Efficiently storing EAV data through partitioning and compression
•	ETL on frequently changing EAV data
•	Pivoting EAV data for efficient queries

# TempDB- More permanent impact than you think
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: TempDB- More permanent impact than you think
## Abstract:
### As a DBA you hear different theories and "gospel truths" about TempDB from many people. Frankly there is no single version of the truth except that if you don't use and manage it well, it will make your life a real h*ll.
What works for you in one situation may not work for you in another situation. What works for a situation today, might not guarantee its success for a similar situation tomorrow.

We will talk about 
Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?
Trace Flags to Manage Tempdb?
Should we store the entire Tempdb on SSDs?
Should we shrink TempDB or not?

Hopefully at the end of the session your knowledge on Tempdb won't be Temp.

# Managing Security in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Managing Security in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In the world of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), everything we do involves moving data from one point to another. However, very often the focus in SSIS package development is on functionality, not security. When building internal data transformation and movement processes, it is easy to forget that these operations broaden our security footprint, and must be actively managed to ensure that ETL doesn’t become the weak link in the security chain.

In this presentation, we’ll discuss the security features in SQL Server Integration Services, while reviewing best practices for securing your ETL infrastructure while providing enough (but not too much) access to those ETL assets. Among the topics we’ll cover:
	Properly securing connection passwords in SSIS
	Using package protection levels
	Restricting access to deployed packages
	Using role-based security for SSIS deployment and execution
	Using execution proxies

# The New Revolution in Data Science, R Integrated into SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: The New Revolution in Data Science, R Integrated into SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages that are used to increase functionality of the core R language. The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will demo the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server.

# Taking the pain out of database migrations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Lumnah
## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
## Abstract:
### Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.

You will learn how to leverage publicly available datasets with data that is internally created within your organization. Although the focus is on how the analysis techniques are applied to any industry, the demonstrations show specific cases, including health care, asset management, and earth science. Join us for a discussion where we'll explore the options available for visualizing the results and discuss the pros cons and limitations of each technology. You likely already have spatial data, this session shows you how to use it effectively.

# Picking the Right Fights with Your Server Team
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Picking the Right Fights with Your Server Team
## Abstract:
### Being a DBA is more challenging than ever—virtualized infrastructure, tiered storage and the cloud mean you may not know where you servers are, what disks your data is on, and you have less control than ever. In order to keep your databases performing and to provide an optimal environment you have to pick your battles. You have limited capital, and you only want to pick the most important fights.
In this session you will learn about how to choose battles and win (with data!):
•	How to configure storage and file systems for SQL Server
•	Why you should always compress your backups
•	How your virtual machines should be configured for SQL Server
•	What rights you and your servers need in Active Directory
•	Many more and more importantly—which battles NOT to fight
After attending this session, you will have a good understanding of how to talk with your peers in the infrastructure teams and make sure the key SQL Servers in your environment have the resources they need to perform great.

# SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Taiob Ali
## Title: SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know
## Abstract:
### As a production DBA, do you struggle to schedule heavy jobs to avoid times when the server is already overloaded? Have you ever felt like your end users notice data corruption, blocked processes, or a full tempdb even before you do? And have you ever been frustrated by the fact that Agent never stores quite enough job history to help you troubleshoot job failures? The fact is, SQL Server Agent can do way more than just schedule jobs at a fixed time. In this session you'll learn how to make SQL Agent run jobs only when ample CPU resources are available, how you can be the first to get notified when data corruption has occurred, and how to use Agent for monitoring data file size issues. You will also walk away with a set of scripts that will help you customize job history retention. By the end of this demo rich session you will understand how to leverage SQL Agent’s hidden gems that will make your database management job more efficient without requiring additional development time.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server vNext
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change how you tune and troubleshoot performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need to apply it to your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts as well as your Azure SQL Databases.

# Never Have to Say "Mayday!!!" Again
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#500---Boston-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: Never Have to Say "Mayday!!!" Again
## Abstract:
### December 1978: 10 people die in a commercial airliner. Why? Bad troubleshooting skills and poor maintenance – disaster-causing attitudes. As you'll learn in this session, the doomed airliner ran out of fuel while the crew of three wasted time troubleshooting a false alarm. We can draw some parallels in the database world. Poor troubleshooting, disaster-causing attitudes, and a lack of disaster preparedness lead to needless downtime and serious user impact across our environments. 

In this session, we'll look at case studies of real-life aviation disasters and production database downtime incidents. We'll see similarities in attitudes that cause disasters. Come learn about the importance of preparation, troubleshooting, and teamwork. This will be an interactive session where we’ll pick apart disasters, engage in discussion around case studies, and leave prepared to change attitudes in ourselves and our colleagues and avoid disasters at work.
