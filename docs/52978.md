## Title: Data Modeling 101
## Abstract:
### Covering the basics for the beginner and those that have been thrown into a modeling role and have been cowboy’n it like the Wild West.  We’ll cover why you should bother with a conceptual model and invest some of your project time in the modeling task.  We will  go over some different modeling techniques around Normalized, Dimensional and Data Vault options.   And lastly, considerations for scalability, sustainability and empowering you with a Data Access Layer so you stay in control of your architecture as opposed to the application beast.  Yee-Haw!
