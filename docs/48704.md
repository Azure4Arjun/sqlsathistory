## Title: Moving from Profiler to Extended Events.
## Abstract:
### Profiler has been with us for a long time and it's pretty much the goto tool for a lot of performance related issues but there's been a new tool around for a few years now - actually since SQL SERVER 2008 - but there doesn't seem to have been a big uptake of it. Well, after this session hopefully that will all change for you.
Profiler is now deprecated and all new work is going into extended events. This means that new monitoring events are constantly being added. These give deeper insights into performance problems withing SQL SERVER and also aid the developer / DBA in understanding the inner working of the SQL SERVER database engine.
An understanding of profiler would be advantageous but is definitely not required to get some good insights from this session.
