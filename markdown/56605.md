## Title: Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
## Abstract:
### Test automation is one of several key technical enablement practices that allows data warehouse and  business intelligence teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of test practices and automation tools out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Agile analytics practitioner Lynn Winterboer and DW/BI architect Cher Fox will share essential agile test foundations and data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on this important agile practice, including a demo of how this works!
