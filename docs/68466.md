## Title: Beyond the Stars…Alternative Date Warehouse Structures
## Abstract:
### Beyond the Stars…Alternative Date Warehouse Structures to Empower Your Reporting and Analytics Team.
Star schema has become ubiquitous with Data warehouses and unless you have a well define cube modeled on top of it, they can be difficult for even experienced report writers to use. 
In this session, we will explore alternative structures that once built, with allow for rapid report development,  by anyone who can write a simple select statement; empowering your developers to provide business insight without the dubious task of ‘starting from scratch’.  
The following concepts and structures will be discussed:
•             Base/Detail Structures
•             Current State Structures
•             ‘Point In Time’ Data
•             Band Structures
•             Lifecycle/Timeline Structures
Additionally, we will discuss the importance of granularity, naming, object selection and refresh rates within the context of the aforementioned SQL structures.
