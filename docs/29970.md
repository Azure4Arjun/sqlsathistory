## Speaker: Doug Lane
## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
## Abstract:
### Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful?

Lately it just hasn't been the same. You've been stuck in the same old routine, doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. Maybe you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products. Maybe you and RS just weren't meant to be together.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by showing you how to design for better performance, explaining what RS has been trying to tell you through logs (but you haven't been listening), and demonstrating some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.
