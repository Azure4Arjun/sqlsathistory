## Abstract:
### Boy Scouts, Role-Playing Gamers, Human Resources...they all have handbooks to help them navigate their roles. Now database developers have one too! In this session, we'll cover the essentials for any T-SQL developer to succeed. Topics include a method for writing new queries, measuring query performance, the importance of date tables and window functions, and time-saving tricks you never knew were possible in Management Studio. In addition to these quick wins, we'll cover some longer-term strategies to set you up for faster career growth. If you're looking for the missing manual for developers in their first two years, this session is for you.
