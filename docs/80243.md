## Title: Shiny, SSAS Tabular Model Developed from a Star Schema
## Abstract:
### A deep dive into a Tabular Model developed from a Star Schema. We review different levels of normalization versus de-normalization. We examine how all relationships require a M:1 cardinality that is joined on a pair of single columns. We will clarify that models cannot include model ambiguity.
