## Abstract:
### This presentation provides a high level overview of Big Data analysis using Microsoft Data Mining Tools and fundamental statistical methods. It is an ideal opportunity for those considering using Big Data to identify patterns and gain insight from their data. We will demonstrate data mining models such as Decision Tree, Clustering, Logistic Regression, Time Series, or Neural Network.  We will visualize the results using the Data Mining plugin for Excel 2013.
