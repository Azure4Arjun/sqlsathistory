## Title: SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables â€“Clearing The Confusion
## Abstract:
### The Azure platform is quickly gaining momentum and acceptance, in part due to the relational database capabilities of SQL Azure as well as the inexpensive and high-capacity storage capabilities of Azure Tables. Yet, there seems to be some confusion as to why and when you would use SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables. One is relational, and one is not, yet there has been a tendency to use Azure Storage Tables as a replacement for SQL Azure, with poor results. This session will provide a deep look at the difference between SQL Azure and Azure Storage Tables, and show the performance differences when querying each. We will look at how each stores data and the pros and cons of using each as a storage mechanism, and discuss how and why you would choose.
