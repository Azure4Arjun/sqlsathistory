## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: Tell the story with Power BI visualizations embedded in your web site based on Azure Data
## Abstract:
### Honey, Let Me Drive!  
See how husband and wife tech team, Steve and Susan Schneider, set up a Florida traffic database in Azure and build dynamic interactive presentations using Power BI, without killing each other or ‘driving’ each other crazy!  
In this fast pace seminar, you’ll get a quick overview of how to set up an Azure database and move data to Azure; then it’s off for a road trip with Power BI.  Using Power BI visualizations, we’ll answer some questions like:
1-	What color of vehicle is most likely to be in an accident
2-	What make and model get into crashes most often
3-	What counties in Florida have the highest amount of accidents?  Hint:  It is not Duval!
4-	Do more accidents really happen on one day of the week over another day?
And much more!
Come along on this trip to see how you can stand up your own database in Azure and use Power BI to make your data ‘ready for the road’
