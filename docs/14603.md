## Title: Extending the Data Collector to Monitor SQL Server effortlessly
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Data Collector has earned a bad name since its inception in SQL Server 2008. It has always been hard to customize, troubleshoot and extend. However, things are changing now with a new open source tool that lets you manage and customize your data collection with a graphical user interface and allows collecting data from Extended Events. Why not give Data Collector another try? Itâ€™s free, it ships with the product and in this session you will learn how to extend it to create a complete monitoring solution.
