## Title: Introducing dbachecks : Unit testing for your database infrastructure
## Abstract:
### Have you ever setup a new instance and realized later that you skipped a configuration step? Did you get handed a database from another team and want to see how much work you have to do to clean up it’s configuration? Don’t you wish there was an easy way to validate that every instance in your environment was configured correctly?

In this session we’ll be learning about an exciting new powershell module called dbachecks which seeks to solve these problems. Built upon the backbones of dbatools and pester, this is a unit testing framework with over 100 predefined checks to validate your instances.
