## Speaker: Bill Graziano
## Title: Preparing to be Hacked
## Abstract:
### They are going to get in.  This session talks briefly about how they get in.  But they are going to get in.  It talks a little about security best practices.  But one little mistake by anyone and they are in.  How will you know they’re in?  How will you know how they got in?  What do they want?  How will you know what they’re doing?  How will you know if you’ve kicked them out?  This session will focus on the type of logging and tripwires you’ll need to respond to a breach of your SQL Servers.   It includes a mix of technical solution and process recommendations based on actual incidents.
