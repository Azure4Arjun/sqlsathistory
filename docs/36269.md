## Speaker: Steve Stedman
## Title: Introduction to Policy Based Management
## Abstract:
### Many of the things a DBA needs to monitor on a regular basis can be performed with Policy Based Management. Mistakes made by junior DBAs or developers who donâ€™t understand the database policies can be caught and prevented with Policy Based Management. As a built-in feature in SQL Server, Policy Based Management is often overlooked. Learn about policies, facets, and conditions. With more demo than slides, this session will show you what you need to know to get started with Policy Based Management in your organization. By the end of this session you will have a solid understanding of what Policy Based Management is, when you should use it, and how to use it appropriately. This session is also a good prep for some material in the 70-462 Administering Microsoft SQL Server exam.
