## Title: Using Premium Data for Analysts
## Abstract:
### Did you know that you can verify business names, addresses and credit status from within Excel?  Big Data also means premium data, but what is it and how do you use it?  Come to this session to learn via demonstrations, what types of premium data are out there, how to get the right data easily (usually from inside of Excel) and how to estimate costs accurately.  We'll look at Dun  Bradstreet, Melissa Data, Strike Iron and more.
