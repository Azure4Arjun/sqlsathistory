## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: Build your first Service Broker application
## Abstract:
### Service broker provides scalable asynchronous message processing that can prove extremely useful to both DBA’s and Developer’s.
However, Service Broker is possibly one of the least used components of SQL Server despite debuting in the product in 2005.
This session will aim to demystify Service Broker and introduce people to some of the major benefits that it offers.
We’ll build a full application which will demonstrate just how easy it is to get up and running with this technology.
This session is aimed at people with little to no Service Broker knowledge and aims to show how applications can be easily created with Service Broker. You should leave this session with enough knowledge to then take your Service Broker skills to the next level and be capable of handling more complex projects.
