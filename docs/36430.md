## Title: Log SQL Server Activity on a Budget
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has some of the best monitoring tools out there. But what about that server you just discovered? And you're all out of monitoring licences? Or, what if you need additional information that your monitoring tool isn't providing? Or, would you like execution plans and lock information for further analysis? All this and more is possible using the industry standard sp_whoisactive, created by Adam Machanic, to monitor and log activity on your SQL Servers. This session will teach you how to log and query the wealth of information sp_whoisactive provides.
