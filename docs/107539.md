## Title: The NextGen in Time Series Landscape
## Abstract:
### The time series landscape evolves fast to meet the aggressive challenges in IoT. After Influx 2.0 Beta was released in the first days of 2020, in Jul 2020 Azure Time Series Insights Gen 2 became generally available.
Already Top 1 by popularity, InfluxDB introduces v.2.0 as a revolutionary change.
 It now uses the new Flux and open source data language, supported in VS Code. Inspired by TOP 1 scripting language – JavaSript. Flux takes a functional approach against data exploration and processing to allow read/write to RDBMS stores and enable the unmatched capability to enrich and filter time series with external RDBMS data on query level. Check this session out to embrace the upcoming changes.
