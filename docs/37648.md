## Title: PolyBase: unleash the power of Big Data in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Microsoft's SQL-over-Hadoop solution that was once only available in Analytics Platform System (APS) appliances will now be available in the next version of SQL Server. You'll be able to easily combine unstructured data stored in your Hadoop cluster with relational data using familiar T-SQL instructions. No expert Hadoop knowledge required, just the desire to unleash the power of your data, in any form or size!
