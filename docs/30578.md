## Speaker: Joe Celko
## Title: Advanced Table Constraints
## Abstract:
### The goal of Good SQL is to avoid procedural. The more taht can be put into declarative code, the better the optimizer can do its job. This will cover the use of CASE expressions, overlapping UNIQUE constraints, state transition constraints, and  Kusnetsov's temporal constraints.
