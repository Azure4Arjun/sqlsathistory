## Title: Microsoft Cloud BI
## Abstract:
### With the growing number of mobile users, requirements for browser-based BI and the lower TCO of cloud-based solutions, Cloud BI is becoming a dominate topic in the business intelligence world. In this session, I will demonstrate how to create a complete working Microsoft BI application that is cloud-based using SQL Server, SQL Azure, PowerPivot and Silverlight.
