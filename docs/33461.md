## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: File IO Stalls and Wait Stats:  Tune Like a Guru!!
## Abstract:
### When you know how to find out WHAT your queries are waiting on you get a very good clue about how to fix them - or help the server as a whole in many cases.  Lots of stuff here you will want to put in your bag of tuning tricks!  I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this!  :-D
