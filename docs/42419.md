## Title: Query Optimization Crash Course
## Abstract:
### Do you have users complaining that applications are running "too slow"?  Do your DB traces look like a short story written by monkeys at typewriters?
This is a fun, fast-paced walkthrough of the most effective strategies for query tuning.  We'll investigate the most common causes of sub-optimal queries (and some quite unusual ones) while building a foundation for solving any optimization problem that the application throws your way!
