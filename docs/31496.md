## Title: Business Intelligence from data to presentation
## Abstract:
### Data is the backbone of every business and providing the decision makers with accurate and up-to-date information can go long ways for every organization. With SQL Server being the backbone of Microsoft driven Business Intelligence (BI) Solution we will look at how you can build a BI solution from ground up mashing data from different sources and creating a data model that will streamline your environment data collection while provide a visual dashboard with KPIâ€™s, Scorecard, Reports and Filters and presenting them in a SharePoint 2010 environment.
