## Title: Exploring SQL 2008's MERGE
## Abstract:
### MERGE is a new capability in SQL Server 2008. This session will start with the basics of what MERGE is and then dig into how it works and how it compares to using traditional INSERT/UPDATE semantics. You should come away from this session with a good understanding of MERGE, ready to implement it in your environment.
