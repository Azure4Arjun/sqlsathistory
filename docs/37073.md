## Title: How to be a Cloud DBA
## Abstract:
### Traditional DBA's do not just take care of making sure the backups work.  We help teams promote their databases from DEV to Production, we make copies from Production to Dev and perhaps anonimize some data on the way. In this session we will look at a bunch of our tasks that are traditionally the domain of the DBA and we will look at how to perform these tasks in a cloud or hybrid cloud situation.
