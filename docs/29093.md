## Title: Geographic Visualizations Using Maps in SSRS
## Abstract:
### This session will explore the many and varied uses of the map report item in Reporting Services. From providing geographic analytics to diagramming locations on a warehouse floorplan, the map report item â€“ when combined with SQL Server spatial data types - can be used in a variety of ways to create spatial representations of your data. We may even look at a game or two created using the map report item.
