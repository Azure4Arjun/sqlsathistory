## Title: DAX: Functions and Context - That's What It's All About!
## Abstract:
### To get the most from our SSAS Tabular and Power BI models, we must be able to create robust DAX expressions. This requires the right interplay of filtering, context and the myriad of DAX functions. This session will provide a solid working understanding of all three, giving you a firm foundation for fulfilling those demanding user requirements. This session will include examples using some of the most recent additions to the ever-expanding DAX language.
