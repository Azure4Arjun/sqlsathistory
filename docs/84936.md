## Title: Power BI Embedding – Ecolab’s Story
## Abstract:
### The business intelligence team at Ecolab has ridden a wave of evolving features and capabilities of Power BI, hanging ten through several permutations of embedding architecture, to provide customer and internal users with excellent and secure Power BI reports and dashboards, through its employee and customer portals.  If you’re considering Power BI content delivery in the context of a web application or portal, It’s quite likely that our story will offer something that will help you avoid a few spilled marbles and backaches.  We will describe the architecture we use, steps we took to get here, how and why we did certain things, and let you ask questions pertinent to your situation.
