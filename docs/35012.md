## Title: DBA 101: Best Practices Every DBA Should Know
## Abstract:
### This session, which is designed for part-time or full-time DBAs with one year or less of DBA experience, explores some of the key best practices that all DBAs should be familiar with. The session is divided into two parts. The first covers "Check and Verify," which covers one-time tasks that should be performed on all SQL Servers, and "On-Going Tasks," which cover periodic tasks all DBAs should be performing. Because of time limitations, the focus is on what you need to do, not how to do it. This of this session as a basic checklist of what all DBA need to do to optimize performance and maximize server availablity.
