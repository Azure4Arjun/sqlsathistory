## Title: Azure Data Factory V2: The cloud SSIS we have been waiting for?
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory V2 is relatively new in Azure and has a lot of great new SSIS-like features but is it good enough to replace SSIS? In this session we will go over some of the new control flow, branching, and scheduling features in Azure Data Factory and see how to make a fully cloud capable data orchestration engine. As a bonus we'll also show how you can run SSIS packages directly in Azure!
