## Title: Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about columnstore indexes? Maybe you've read about it, but not yet tested it? If you're developing or managing data warehouses, then the columnstore index is the biggest turbo button you'll ever get for your current hardware. Learn how SQL Server stores the data differently and how it uses new access patterns to retrieve data at blazing speeds. You'll see the difference between clustered and non-clustered columnstore indexes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of both.
