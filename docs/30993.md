## Title: Reporting DBs behind Virtual IP's
## Abstract:
### Tips, tricks and architecture options to successfully use Virtual IP's to give your users 100% reporting database uptime with a minimum of pain (and most importantly, learn from our mistakes, its much easier).  This session describes how we used VIP's (virtual IP's) to present 10TB of datawarehouse to thousands of users to run user generated reports 24x7x365 with good maintenance and recoverability practices.
