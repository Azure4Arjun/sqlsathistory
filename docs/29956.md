## Title: ETL with SSIS for Beginners
## Abstract:
### You’ve heard of the term “ETL” before, but you’re not quite sure what it really is and how to do it. In this session we’ll demystify this so-called ETL.  Don’t worry, no previous experience required. We’ll work our way from getting your data from your sources, to cleaning and reformatting them, and loading them to your data warehouse. We will also look at some standards and conventions you should consider when doing ETL to simplify your process, and save you some headaches in the future. 

Of course, our go-to ETL tool is SSIS.
