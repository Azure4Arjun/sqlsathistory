## Speaker: Frank La Vigne
## Title: Machine Learning Melee: AWS vs Azure
## Abstract:
### The world is drowning in data and there’s a gold rush in the business of turning data into actionable insight. In one corner, stands AWS, a long time cloud services innovator, that wants to leverage its PaaS dominance to take it into the next decade. In the other corner, stands a scrappy re-invigorated Microsoft with a new focus on making the cloud smarter.

Both are feverishly working on creating compelling solutions for developers to build intelligent solutions upon. Is one better than the other? What are each one’s strengths and weaknesses?

And what does Google have up its sleeve?

Come to this session to get a first hand account of a former Microsoft evangelist now working at an AWS partner startup, who promises to keep it a good clean fight!
