## Title: SQL Server Transaction Log Internals
## Abstract:
### The transaction log plays the most critical role in any SQL Server database.  In this talk I will discuss the importance of transaction log and the roles it plays inside the database engine.  Weâ€™ll look at how logging and recovery works, the checkpoint process, write-ahead logging, and steps you need to take as a DBA to ensure proper management of the transaction log for a SQL Server database.
