## Title: SQL Server 2014 - New Cardinality Estimator
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server 2014 query processing has been improved. What we can expect from new cardinality estimator? Does it really estimate better? Will our execution plans be better after migration to 2014? All of them? Is the key ascending column statistics problem solved in new version? Do we finally can have more than 200 steps in the statistics histogram per table? What about column correlation and cardinality estimates - are the predicates still completely independent?

This session will answers all these questions and will demonstrate new query processing capabilities and compare them with those from SQL Server2012.
