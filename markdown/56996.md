## Title: Treasure Map: Choosing the Right Algorithm in Azure ML
## Abstract:
### Data scientists uses various data-mining algorithms to do the prediction. Having a map on how to choose an algorithm, which is more appropriate for solving problems is always challenging. This session will provide an explanation of data mining algorithm with the Azure ML environment. The audience will see a couple of demos on each algorithm types. At the end of this session, they will be able to distinguish between each algorithm type. Moreover, the audience will be familiar with available algorithm specifications and usage.
