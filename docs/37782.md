## Title: Determining performance bottlenecks and how flash storage helps databases
## Abstract:
### This session will give an overview of how to use SQL to find performance bottlenecks, determine their source and the effects of flash storage technology on database architecture.  Also included is a live demo of SQL running on a flash storage array.

Flash storage is the new wave of technology hitting data centers and database design.  With any new technology, knowledge is power.  Flash storage comes with a new set of pros  cons, new economics and changes in architecture that highlight what it has to offer while avoiding the common traps.  Before migrating or testing, learn the what's, how's and when's.
