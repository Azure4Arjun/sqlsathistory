## Title: SSIS Process Automation Design for the T-SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### This session is geared towards T-SQL developers who are interested in ETL framework or process automation. In this session we will go over how to create a single SSIS package that can be used for process flow automation without the need to constantly update the SSIS package whenever there is a change. When something happens, something or multiple things need to happen. The architecture that will be presented is powered by tables, stored procedures and recursive CTEs.
