## Title: Deep Dive in Azure Data Factory V2
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory V2 represents a major new release to the Microsoft's cloud data integration tool, and a complete paradigm shift from V1. We'll discuss which changes are the most significant and which features have stayed the same.  Then, we'll dive into the inner workings of Data Factory V2 so we can discuss common usage patterns, such as loading data from multiple tables with a single pipeline, incrementally pulling data from source systems, and other data warehouse loading techniques.
