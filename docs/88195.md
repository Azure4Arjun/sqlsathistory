## Title: Imposter Syndrome   How to work through it
## Abstract:
### At one point or another most of us have had that feeling. You feel like you are about to be fired at any moment, like it is only a matter of time until they find out you don't know what you are doing and you are out of your depth. Or maybe you are sitting in a meeting with a group of your peers discussing the project you are working on. You see what you believe to be a large flaw in the current project, yet you do not speak up as you feel like you and not qualified enough to voice your concern. When your coworkers or boss pay you a compliment and try to express how impressed they are with you work or value as an employee do you try to diminish the complement or your value? If you have ever been in one of the situations above you have probably had a case of Imposter Syndrome. In this session we will discuss what Imposter Syndrome is, how it affects people and most importantly how to identify it in yourself and others and some techniques to help you break out of these feelings.
