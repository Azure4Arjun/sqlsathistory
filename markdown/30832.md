## Speaker: Joe Healy
## Title: Windows Phone Garage
## Abstract:
### You're invited to spend a few hours working with "SAMS WP7 Development in 24 Hours" book authors Kevin Wolf and Joe Healy on your Windows Phone applications.  We can play "fix the architecture", brainstorm, troubleshoot, or just give you a quiet zone to co-work on your applications.  Every 30 minutes Joe or Kevin will supply some "quick tips" in a lightning talk format from their book.  Bring your laptop pre-loaded with the devtools and be ready to go.
