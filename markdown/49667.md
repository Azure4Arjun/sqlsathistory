## Title: Upgrade your Database Development Skills with SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### Join me to upgrade your database development skills utilizing SQL Server Data Tools Database Projects. The development methodologies for designing databases has lagged behind that of application development for some time. With SQL Server Data Tools, you will have another tool in your tool belt for better integrating design, development and deployment tasks that utilize the same Integrated Development Environment as you do when developing application code. Using the new "Declarative" model to database development you will be able to make changes without ALTER scripts.  In this session we will discuss all of the facets of SSDT and how to create new solutions and migrate existing solutions to your new Database projects.
