## Title: Where to with NoSql
## Abstract:
### The session will look at ways that the Sql and NoSql worlds can fit together. It will cover some of the major NoSql offerings such as Cassandra, MongoDb and Hadoop, and present some idea on how Sql fits with these non-Sql stores. It will particularly emphasize hadoop and some of the problems and opportunities offered  by mixing hadoop and sql.
