## Speaker: Oliver Engels
## Title: Access Services are cool! Are you kidding? :)
## Abstract:
### No! Access Services in SharePoint 2013 are really cool, if used in the right way and with clear expectations. This session will give you a detailed demo-driven look to the possibilities you have with Access Services, how you integrate it with SSRS, how you can use it as RAD toolset or as an simple but effective MDS approach. A comparison to the version in SharePoint 2010, deployment and change management tips and tricks will round up the session.
