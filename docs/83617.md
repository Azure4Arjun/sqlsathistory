## Title: dbatools - PowerShell and SQL Server Working Together
## Abstract:
### The dbatools module now has over 300 commands and I can imagine anyone who starts using it probably has no idea where to start.

In this session I'll show you a set of commands which will help you start automating your tasks immediately.
