## Title: New life for Reporting Services: what's up in 2016
## Abstract:
### During 2015 PASS Summit, Microsoft announced a roadmap to harmonize and standardize its BI reporting solutions into one unique hybrid scenario.
Reporting Services will play a crucial role in this new architecture. Starting from 2016 release, Reporting Services will be the Microsoft's on-premises solution for BI report delivery, meaning that it will host on-premises standard report as well as mobile report as well as Power BI Desktop report. 
To achieve this goal Reporting Services has been completely revisited and redesigned. Rendering engine has been rewritten in HTML5 to support every modern browser.  
Come to this session to have an overview of the new features introduced in Reporting Service 2016. 
You will see the brand new portal supporting both paginated and mobile reports, how to pin charts to Power BI dashboards, how to position report parameters the way you want, how to export reports to PowerPoint, the new charts introduced and many other exciting outlines.
