## Title: Tips that have saved my bacon
## Abstract:
### In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others
