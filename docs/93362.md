## Title: Becoming a Master by Giving It All Away
## Abstract:
### It has been said that “novices absorb knowledge like a sponge, intermediates hoard it for themselves, and masters just simply give it away.” 
The community spirit of PASS is for like-minded professionals to interact and share knowledge. But how do you do this in your own workplace? IT people are notorious about being siloed and not sharing their knowledge. That may be, but you have to move past all of that in order to truly move forward in your career and your life. There are many barriers in place to giving away your knowledge, but we will help you be ready to do so. 
The only way to truly become a master at your craft is to share your precious knowledge with your peers and workmates. We will discuss past and new trends in learning and knowledge transfer, the reasons why you should pass on knowledge, and methods for making this happen in your workplace and in your life.
By passing on your knowledge, you are leaving behind a legacy that extends beyond your tenure at an organization
