## Speaker: Matt Allington
## Title: DAX as a Query Language
## Abstract:
### Many people (business and IT) already use Power Pivot, Power BI and SSAS Tabular to produce reporting and analytics tools.  But did you know that these tools also have their own query language?   In traditional databases such as SQL server, it is possible to extract data into a new table.  The same is possible using DAX as a query language with a tabular data model.

In this session, Matt will introduce the topic and show how you can use DAX Studio to connect to a data model.  Once connected, DAX studio can be used to write queries over the tabular data model to start to interrogate the data itself (as opposed to simply aggregating the values into a pivot table or a Power BI report).  The learning can then be used to write more complex DAX measures or alternatively it can be used to extract tabular data directly into a table for further analysis.
