## Title: SQL Server Graph Database
## Abstract:
### The next version of SQL Server will run on either Windows or Linux and includes new functionality including graph database features. Graph databases are ideal for those cases where there is a relationship that exists but it doesn't fit the rigid hierarchy of a relational table. Graph databases easily manage data where there are differing degrees of separation - the so-called Kevin Bacon problem. The degrees of separation problem is highly relevant to important real world problems such as root cause analysis, bill of materials, parts explosion, where used queries, route planning, and fraud detection just to name a few. New syntax exists is take advantage of storing and processing relationships. Learn how this transformative technology works and then update your resume!
