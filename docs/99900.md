## Speaker: Dan de Sousa
## Title: Azure Data Factory as easy as 1..2...3
## Abstract:
### In this session I will introduce Azure Data Factory and will demonstrate how easy it is to start using the service and how to get your ETL going forward in a matter of minutes. I will go through the best practices and, based on my experience, will expose some scenarios when I had to rethink the way ti should work because of some of the limitations of the service. I will explore the limitations and some ideas on how to overcome them.
There will be some live demos and by the end of the session we may have a working ETL solution that will move data from a SQL database as well as from a Blob Storage into an Azure SQL Datawarehouse (or a PaaS) instance.
