## Title: BI Pivot Tables  Charts, Not a 1 Tool Exercise
## Abstract:
### This session begins with a simple SQL database with several related tables.  It then shows how to import those tables to create a simp;le cube in Analysis Services.  Given a simple, but functional cube, the session then goes into Excel to use the cube in Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.  Finally, you will see how easy it is to publish those Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts into SharePoint using Excel Services to protect the calculation methods while allowing anyone with a browser to see and use your results.
