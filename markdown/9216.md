## Title: Merge-tastic: a better way of loading dimensions
## Abstract:
### The T-SQL Merge statement provides a world of opportunities to save a lot of time.In this session we’ll look at how merge can be used to perform complex multi-stage tasks such as loading data into data warehouse dimensions, including the handling of type 0, 1  2 slowly changing dimensions.I’ll present a summary of my MSc dissertation findings, comparing the performance of using T-SQL Merge against other more traditional methods of loading slowly changing dimensions in SSIS.We’ll also look at how we can use dynamic SQL to completely automate the generation of the merge statement, resulting in an incredibly simple meta-data configured dimension loads in your data warehouse.
