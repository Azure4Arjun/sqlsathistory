## Title: A Toolkit for Off-loading Data from Production
## Abstract:
### So, you have a problem with too much old data in your production database, right? Also, because production is the only place where your data currently is available, almost everyone has an account with permissions in that same database?
SQL Server comes with many tools that, when properly used, can make your life a whole lot more easy; some of which are: SQLCMD scripting, the Change Tracking system, Transactional Replication and the MERGE command.
In this session you will be presented to a simple toolkit that will utilize these tools to set up synchronization of your production data to an offline database in a way that is easy to configure and manage. The toolkit contains a very small number of T-SQL and SQLCMD scripts together with a “How to” instruction. Best of all – it#180;s available in Standard edition!
