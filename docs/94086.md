## Title: Clever data: Building a chatbot from your database
## Abstract:
### The development of Artificial Intelligence is increasingly present in our lives and as time goes by, its presence will grow thanks to the momentum that enterprises are currently providing. 

One of the most engaging AI applications are chatbots, which interact with real-time users in order to assist them to perform a task -such as booking a hotel, answering a question or looking for specific information on the Internet- while simulating that a real human is behind the scene.

Data is knowledge, and the data that has been stored in your Azure SQL database can be used as an input for a bot which assists a company's customers in order to process the information for them and return expected results.

This session will be focused on explaining the actors involved when building a bot capable of obtaining data from your storage, including Azure SQL Database, Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services). A mobile app built with Xamarin will be used as demo.
