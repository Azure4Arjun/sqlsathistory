## Title: Power BI Desktop – Leveraging the magic of Power BI - ON-PREM
## Abstract:
### It won’t be long before we host the majority of our data, compute power, reporting, and BI visualizations in the cloud, but we’re not all there quite yet. In this presentation, we will discuss ONLY those options that are available on-premises, covering functionality differences between Power BI and Power BI Desktop as well as the critical integration of .pbix dashboards and visualizations with other enterprise reporting and collaboration tools, such as SharePoint, PowerPoint, Excel, and SQL Server Reporting Services. We’ll also highlight the Microsoft BI roadmap for SQL Server 2016, SSRS, Power BI, Datazen, and what it means specifically for on-premise customers.
