## Title: Denormalization for Performance: A Costly Illusion (EN)
## Abstract:
### If you believe that you must "denormalize for performance", you've internalized a very costly misconception prevalent in the industry. The core Principle of Full Normalization (PFN) in database design is there for practical reasons, not just theoretical "purity" and you violate it at your peril. But despite having been amply debunked, this myth is hard to dislodge because both vendors and users lack foundation knowledge.This presentation demonstrates that:1. It is actually impossible for normalization to affect performance2. If performance with databases that are not fully normalized is better than those that are (which is rarely the case):* the gain does not come from denormalization* even if it did, the cost would not justify the benefit
