## Title: Getting Started With SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### SQL Azure is Microsoft's solution for hosting basic SQL Server relational databases in the cloud. Microsoft continues to add new features in each Azure Service Update that makes SQL Azure a more viable solution. For smaller databases that don't require features such as Reporting Services, Analysis Services, or Full Text Search, it can be an easy to use technology that can save lots of money in hardware, license and maintenance costs. This session shows you how to configure, connect to, and manage a SQL Azure database, both from SQL Server Management Studio and from a .NET application, and it gives best practices and tips on how to get the most benefit from SQL Azure.
