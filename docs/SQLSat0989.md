## Title: Double Power - Managing Power BI with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Power BI comes with a rich API, which you can use to perform various tasks. Administrators can enumerate workspaces, reports, dashboards and datasets, recover orphaned workspaces, or list all the data sources used in their organization. Users can make a backup of all their published reports. Developers can easily provision new instances of their reports for each new customer. In this session I will show various practical examples how you can do these tasks and explore what is possible even further. No previous PowerShell knowledge is required – it is THAT simple :)

## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: What’s in the Cloud for my Datawarehouse
## Abstract:
### There are several reasons to look at the Azure Cloud for your DW: Elasticity and price, You plan to put your data sources or data consumers in the Cloud or you have non-relational data types to store and process on top of your existing datawarehouse. But there are so many questions on the way and before even taking this journey. Where to start and how to plan the movement? Which service to use for the DW in the Cloud? How to move and run ETL packages in the cloud? Should you migrate to Azure Synapse or should you use different Data Store? Let’s get the things in order and let’s try to make the path of this journey a bit more clear by answering all those questions.

# Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#989-–-Sofia-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 10-10-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks
## Abstract:
### Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions. 

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors – something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.

# Azure Data Factory - how to implement incremental loads for PARQUET
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#989-–-Sofia-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 10-10-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Ivan Donev
## Title: Azure Data Factory - how to implement incremental loads for PARQUET
## Abstract:
### Incremental loads in a DWH environment is a key process everyone needs to consider. PARQUET in data lake by default does not implement in-place updates which makes delta loading quite a challenge. Of course there is the delta lake, but what if we are still not ready to go there? Join me in the session to review the different options we have for implementing incremental loads in a data lake with parquet files.

# Performance Tuning with Optimistic Concurrency
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#989-–-Sofia-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 10-10-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Torsten Strauss
## Title: Performance Tuning with Optimistic Concurrency
## Abstract:
### The default transaction isolation level of SQL Server is set to read committed, which eliminates certain read phenomena, but can also affect concurrency and overall read performance.
SQL Server also offers two optimistic transaction isolation levels where a transaction does not acquire a lock when reading data, which reduces the probability of blocks and therefore leads to significantly better reading performance in a busy database.
In this session (level 300), you will learn how to increase the reading performance in a database simply by changing the transaction isolation level to snapshot isolation. You will also understand how SQL Server implements this function internally and what disadvantages it has.

# The NextGen in Time Series Landscape
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#989-–-Sofia-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 10-10-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Ivelin Andreev
## Title: The NextGen in Time Series Landscape
## Abstract:
### The time series landscape evolves fast to meet the aggressive challenges in IoT. After Influx 2.0 Beta was released in the first days of 2020, in Jul 2020 Azure Time Series Insights Gen 2 became generally available.
Already Top 1 by popularity, InfluxDB introduces v.2.0 as a revolutionary change.
 It now uses the new Flux and open source data language, supported in VS Code. Inspired by TOP 1 scripting language – JavaSript. Flux takes a functional approach against data exploration and processing to allow read/write to RDBMS stores and enable the unmatched capability to enrich and filter time series with external RDBMS data on query level. Check this session out to embrace the upcoming changes.

## Speaker: Sebastiano Galazzo
## Title: Machine Learning - Best Practices and Vulnerabilities
## Abstract:
### It seems like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are a must nowdays.
For projects carrying a simple or well kown problem we can find a lot of ready-made solutions, but this extremne easy to use could be one of our best enemy when facing with specific custom problems.
With this session we will cover how to apply best practices in configurin ML but much more, do we reaaly need it always?
The second part will cover vulnerabilities of ML discovering how easy could be to fool a neural network by some techinques (Like pixel attack) and their implication in projects that requires no security issues.

## Title: From Gen1 To Gen2. Recipes for a successful Data Lake migration
## Abstract:
### As Data Lake Gen2 is gaining momentum and the product has now reach a very good functional level (new feature such as log analytics, recursive ACLs, Checksum for files in ADF...), it is time to seriously consider a migration from the proprietary Data Lake Gen1 to the Blob Storage based Data Lake Gen2. In this session we will walkthrough the elements of a successful migration such as:
- assessment for identifying existing connections (ADF, Synapse, HDI, ADB....)
- data lake size
- security migration / ACL concepts
- classification of migration complexity
- migration monitoring
- cost of migration
- stakeholders communication
- project plan
- resources needed

## Title: From XL to S - Reduce your Power BI model size by 90%!
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what makes Power BI so fast and powerful when it comes to performance? So powerful, that it performs complex calculations over millions of rows in a blink of an eye.

In this session, we will dig deep to discover what is “under the hood” of Power BI, how your data is being stored, compressed, queried, and finally, brought back to your report. After the session, you will get a better understanding of the hard work happening in the background and appreciate the importance of creating an optimal data model in order to get maximum performance from the Power BI engine.

Finally, you will see a real use-case demo showing how the Power BI data model was reduced by 90%!

## Title: End to end, migrating a database to Azure
## Abstract:
### Migrating to Azure is the step we take to modernize and transform applications and infrastructure by taking advantage of the flexibility and agility of the cloud. There are many different scenarios, tools and routes to successfully migrate your on-premises relational database to Microsoft Azure.
What tools should we use? How do we choose the best approach? How do we analyse the source remove blockers? What are the actual steps we need to take during the migration? How we use the newly set database? It all depends! So lets make it all clear!

## Title: From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019
## Abstract:
### As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.
