## Speaker: Steve Howard
## Title: Stop making ugly Power BI Reports!
## Abstract:
### Power BI is simple to use and it#39;s easy to crank out reports. Before you know it, you have a dozen reports that are somewhat confusing and not quite as appealing as you planned. In this demo heavy session, we will take a fairly typical Power BI report and give it a makeover. We will discuss layout strategy, color palette, and tricks such as slicer orientation, tooltips, visual interactions, use of shapes, and some DAX magic to bring clarity to the data we are trying to convey.
