## Title: Handling Late Arriving Dimension Records in a Datawarehouse using SSIS/SQL
## Abstract:
### Data Warehouse Theory can be a tough nut to crack.  A late arriving dimension record tends to occur when you receive a fact record before the dimension record arrives in the data warehouse so you must create a placeholder record.

In this session, we will give you a brief overview of Facts and Dimensions, and then do an in-depth discussion on what late arriving dimension records are, why they are important, and how to handle them.  We will explain how not properly handling these can negatively affect your Financial Reports.  We will also cover how to correct those records in the data warehouse once the proper dimension record arrives on the doorstep of the data warehouse.
