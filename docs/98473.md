## Title: When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most modern programming environments offers exception handling in some form, and SQL Server provides the popular TRY-CATCH concept. However, error handling in SQL Server is not as straightforward as one may wish, but it is marred with inconsistencies and surprises. This session starts off by displaying the some of the surprises you can encounter, both when you use TRY-CATCH and when you don't.

The session presents a recipe for writing CATCH block where focus is on keeping things simple and you will learn why it is not a good idea to make your error handling "fancy", although it may seem to be a good idea in theory. The session also covers a few things to think of on client level.

Once we have learnt how to handle unanticipated errors, we can start to look at how to handle errors we know can occur and in which case we want to take an alternate action. We will also learn how to - and if - to implement retries on deadlocks.
