## Title: Data quality with DQS components in Integration Services
## Abstract:
### To integrate data quality in ETL-Jobs some preliminary considerations and preparatory work are necessary. The session shows the preparing steps on DataQualityClient, continues with configuration of some validation-rules and then uses the configuration for a first data-import in SSIS.
The DQS meta-information (stored in a DQS-project) is subsequently evaluated by Data-Stuard (a new role of staff member in the companyâ€™s organigramm).
The result of the evaluation is imported via DQS_stagingDB into DQS_Main Database. This provides import after import, i.e. with each ETL-job there is a continuous improvement of data quality.
