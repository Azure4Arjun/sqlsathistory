## Title: Lift Off to the Cloud: Lift  Shift Azure options for the SQL Server BI Stack
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Analytics\BI stack is widely used and mature. Azure PaaS offerings have matured greatly well beyond just Azure SQL DB the last couple of years. This session is designed for SQL Server professionals who want to expand their knowledge set to Azure or those interested in learning more about Azure data solution options. The focus will be on SQL Server on-premise (or on Azure VM\IaaS) to Azure equivalences, complementary tools, and hybrid approaches and possible challenges. Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Data Factory, Azure Analysis Services, Power BI and more will be covered.
