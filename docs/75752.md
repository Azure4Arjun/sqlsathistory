Event Date: 05-05-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: DBA Checklists: Reliable, Repeatable,  Automated.
## Abstract:
### Now that SQL Server loves PowerShell and Microsoft loves open source, it is even easier to automate even your most time-consuming, repetitive, mundane or burdensome tasks.

Using the DbaChecks PowerShell module released at the SQLBits 2018 conference we can:
    Track SQL Server instance configurations
    Promptly provide required information to managmement, change configuration or developers
    Deftly respond to audit change requirements across your entire estate (and impress your auditor with PowerShell;)
    Restore SQL Servers to their correct state prior and post deployment
    Test *everything* from configuration to permissions, SQL service account share access to sysadmins, Agent Jobs to SPNs
 
This session will look at how to install and use this module . With multiple examples we will look at both running the checks and viewing the data in the supplied PowerBI reports.

Pre-requisites
Some basic knowledge of PowerShell and DBA
