## Title: Persistent Memory and Hybrid Buffer Pool - The good, bad and ugly
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2019 will introduce us to a new feature called Hybrid Buffer Pool. The ability of placing database files into "Memory" that does not lose its content in case of a power outage. This session will explore when it makes sense to use this feature and when not to use it.
