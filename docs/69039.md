## Title: Azure ML Algorithm Accuracy Enhancement, Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### Azure ML is the Microsoft cloud based Machine Learning tool. It provides variety of algorithms for doing descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive analysis. Moreover, it supports the variety of Data science the techniques for data wrangling, feature selection, cross validation and so forth for enhancing the accuracy. In this session, I will first talk about how to measure the accuracy of the predictive or descriptive analysis in azure Ml. then I will show how to do feature selection in Azure ML to find proper attributes. Finally, I will demo how to do data sampling and Cross validation using existing components in Azure ML which will help us to enhance the machine learning accuracy.
