## Title: Continuous Integration and Delivery
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration and continuous delivery are two practices that can drastically reduce any software company's testing and deployment times. In this talk, we will be discussing several tools (including TeamCity and Octopus Deploy)  that you can use to streamline these tasks, as well as how you can go from having nothing to a baseline project set up using a template that you've previously created on a publicly accessible development environment in less that 5 minutes. The days of copying and pasting files to a server to deploy your code are over.
