## Title: Developing an End to End Power BI Solution
## Abstract:
### Power BI has a many moving parts that can make it difficult to know when and where each part of the tool is necessary.  In this half day session get a clear end to end journey through creating a Power BI solution.  Start with the data discovery phase by importing and applying business rules to your data.  Then load that data into a data model where you can apply hierarchies and calculations.  Finally using that data model design reports to visualize the results.  Once complete learn how the results can be shared with others by creating dashboards on the Power BI service.  Taking this end to end trip through the tool will allow you to fully understand how each piece fits together.
