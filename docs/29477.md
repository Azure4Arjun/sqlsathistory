## Abstract:
### Introduction to the Tabular Model in Analysis Services 2012
The Tabular model in Analysis Services 2012 is the new alternative to building cubes: itâ€™s easier to develop with (especially if you come from a relational database background) and its in-memory, column-store database provides blindingly fast performance.
