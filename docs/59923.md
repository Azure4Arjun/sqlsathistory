## Speaker: Rachael Phillips
## Title: Sentiment Analysis with R
## Abstract:
### Companies today are using sentiment analysis to improve customer experience by understanding the attitude of their customers based on tweets, facebook posts, and other social networking outlets. The ability to perceive a customer’s feelings benefits that company by advising them on what changes they can make to improve their customer’s experiences. A great way to do this is in open-source tools such as R. In R, we can classify the polarity as well as the emotion behind a comment from Twitter feeds. Rachael will show the basics of using a few R functions to do this, with visualizations as well.
