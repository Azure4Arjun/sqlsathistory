## Title: SQL Server: Indexing Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### We all have indexes in our databases or at least should have indexes in them, but the question is, do we have the right types of indexes? Do we have too many or not enough? Are my indexes beneficial to my database? This session will leave you with the ability to answer these questions and more. Weâ€™ll review the different types of indexes in SQL Server and also discuss the structure of some of the main ones. I will show you how to verify if your indexes are being used, if they are being duplicated and finally how to maintain your indexes.
