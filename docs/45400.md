## Title: What's new in Power BI 2.0
## Abstract:
### In early 2015, Microsoft delivered a new Version of Power BI, Power BI 2.0. After publishing the new Version they kept publishing updates each month. At the end of 2015 Microsoft started to publish visualisations and data sources for Power BI each week. In this session, Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler will show all of the new Features. This will be done by creating a Dashboard live in the session which will analyze data from the Internet Movie Database.
