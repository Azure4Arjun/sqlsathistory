## Title: PowerBI on SAP HANA
## Abstract:
### SAP HANA is ubiquitous nowadays and it will also remain a hot topic in the future. But besides the technical specifications it is also very important how to work with the data in the end and the majority of users still relies on Microsoft Excel here. Especially Office 365 and Power BI enables users to work with this data in a whole new way. In this session I will show how to combine the best of both worlds by using Power BI to load and analyze data that resides in SAP HANA and will highlight the most common pitfalls and what you have to consider.
