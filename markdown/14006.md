## Title: Clusters Your Way: #SANLess Clusters for Physical, Virtual, and Cloud Environments
## Abstract:
### Clustered implementations of SQL Server instances (FCIs) have traditionally used some sort of attached, or shared storage. However, sometimes that is not the best way to deploy an FCI, especially if you are looking to deploy in the cloud-be it Windows Azure or Amazon EC2. Sometimes you may even want a cost-effective disaster recovery solution without the need for SAN replication. Come hear Microsoft Cluster MVP Allan Hirt discuss your storage options to not only create a #SANLess cluster, but also to increase the availability of your SQL Server instances using SSD and flash-based PCIe storage or the cloud.
