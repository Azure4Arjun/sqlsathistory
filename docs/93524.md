## Title: Accelerated Database Recovery: The Future of the Transaction Log
## Abstract:
### New in SQL Server 2019, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Join me for this session to learn about ADR architecture and to see demonstrations of what it can do.
