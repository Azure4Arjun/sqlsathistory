The Fluent NHibernate project builds on this to make NHibernate a breeze to configure. In this presentation, Brian will discuss the pros and cons of ORMs in general, and demonstrate how NHibernate can take the pain out of writing your persistence layer.

# Running mixed workloads on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#28---Baton-Rouge-2010)
Event Date: 14-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Admin I
## Speaker: Jason Massie
## Title: Running mixed workloads on SQL Server
## Abstract:
###  In an ideal world, you can separate your OLTP traffic and reporting so the databases can be optimized for their respective workloads. In the real world, this is not always an option. Real time data means reporting off of the OLTP environment. We will first look at the shortcomings of different reporting solutions. We will then look at features that help a mixed work play nicely together. Some of these features include filtered indexes, indexes views, persisted computed columns, data compression, resource governor, partitioning and others. We will also touch on database design concepts that can help mixed workloads and leave you with topics to research further so you master the juggling act that is mixed workloads

# C# Ninjitsu
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#28---Baton-Rouge-2010)
Event Date: 14-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: .Net 1
## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: C# Ninjitsu
## Abstract:
### C# has humble beginnings as an object oriented language of the purest kind. It was class-based, it was imperative, and it was component-oriented. For many years, the classic object-oriented design principles served class library designers well. But C# is no longer a purely object oriented language. It is no longer an imperative, class-based, component oriented discipline. It is also a generic, declarative, functional discipline. I will reexamine the object-oriented principles and introduce new principles. I will then introduce new refactorings as we move toward a more declarative, fluent world.

# RESTful Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#28---Baton-Rouge-2010)
Event Date: 14-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: .Net 2
## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: RESTful Data
## Abstract:
### REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With WCF Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This session will describe OData (the Open Data Protocol), the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.

# Deciding if VMs are a good choice for your SQL Svr
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#28---Baton-Rouge-2010)
Event Date: 14-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Admin II
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Deciding if VMs are a good choice for your SQL Svr
## Abstract:
### We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.

# Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#28---Baton-Rouge-2010)
Event Date: 14-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Apps\Cloud\Personal Development
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting (as time allows).

## Abstract:
### Building dimensions using the Slowly changing dimension wizard in SSIS is simple and quick.  However its performance and flexibility is questionable.  Even further, when trying to perform incremental loads of your Dimensions using the aforementioned approach or a custom approach prior to Change Data Captured (CDC) offered certain challenges.  In this session Patrick will show you how to utilize CDC and SSIS to incrementally load Type I and Type II dimensions using features that are all native to SQL Server 2008.

•         See how to manage large numbers of breakpoints with labeling, searching and filtering.
•         Extend “data tips” by adding comments, notes and strategically “pinning” these resources to maintain their visibility throughout your session.
•         Demonstrate “collaborative debugging,“ by debugging a portion of an application and then exporting breakpoints and labeled data tips, so that others can leverage your effort, without having to start over.

## Title: Data Mining.. Making $mart financial decisions
## Abstract:
### Over the past few months many financial houses have been severely ‘hit’ by the current slump in the sub prime mortgage market. This has lead to severe losses and considerable client liability. Many firms are now starting to take a ‘serious look’ at the potential utilization of data mining techniques as part of their ongoing efforts to control their risk exposure. This beginner to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at showing the attendee some of the ‘data mining’ prototypes solutions that we are currently developing with SQL Server 2005 / 2008, as a part of our ongoing efforts to manage our risk.

## Speaker: Eli Weinstock-Herman
## Title: Conceptual Data Modeling: Defining Our Data
## Abstract:
### Data modeling is the process of defining structure for data. Some systems might make this seem like something that occurs in a deep well at midnight with water-soluble markers, but a well defined data model can provide greater system longevity, less complexity in application and reporting development, better capability for performance improvements, and less long-term volatility. This session will discuss concepts of data modeling, signs of a well defined model, technical and non-technical benefits we can use for approaching different audiences, and some of the tools we can use in different stages of modeling. We'll wrap up with a practical example of converting business language into the first stages of a conceptual data model.
