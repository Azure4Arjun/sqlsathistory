## Title: Performance Tuning Made Easy
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning is hard, everyone knows that. Attend this session and learn how to define, measure, and analyze performance issues as well as implementing changes and also how to make sure those changes continue to have the desired effects. In short, I break down performance tuning into pieces that anyone can understand. Leave this session knowing what actions to take when you get back to work on Monday.
