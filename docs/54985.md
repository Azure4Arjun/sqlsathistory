## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: Are You Making False Assumptions about Your Data?
## Abstract:
### When starting on a new data project, the first step is usually to interview stakeholders and subject matter experts who list the many assumptions that they have been making about the data in the organization. Unfortunately, these assumptions are rarely 100% true which can cause a significant amount of troubleshooting and bug fixing later in the development process.

In this session, we will build a general purpose solution to this problem. Starting from a list of assumptions encoded in an Excel workbook, a collection of SQL statements to test the assumptions are automatically generated. The results of these statements are visualized using PowerBI to create a completely interactive analysis tool to validate assumptions, and diagnose the assumption violations when they are encountered. 

Even better, a solution to automate and orchestrate this entire process using SSIS and Biml will also be presented. All code for the solution will be provide to attendees for free use in their projects.
