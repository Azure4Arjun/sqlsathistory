## Speaker: Angel Abundez
## Title: Unleash the Tablix
## Abstract:
### Tablix = Table + Matrix. Got it? Good. But wait, what exactly is a Tablix good for then? And where is it in your SSRS Toolbox? Not to worry. Angel will show you how to wake up the Tablix control introduced in SQL Server 2008 R2 using some real-world examples. In this session, you’ll learn why the Tablix features help solve many common reporting scenarios such as Timelining, Summarizing, and Subtotaling. Important takeaways from this session are how to aggregate everywhere in your Tablix with single formulas and condensing very wide reports. We’ll also cover some visualization  reporting techniques to help solve some pretty common reporting requests such as Exporting to Excel. Please welcome: Table, Matrix, and List.
