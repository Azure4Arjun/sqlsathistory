## Speaker: Tobe Pittman
## Title: Deploying without a Hitch
## Abstract:
### Making life a little easier by creating an airtight deployment process.  Will address methods of scripting, versioning, creating bootstrap and test data, security, rolling back, etc.  By reducing human interaction (and thus error) and increasing the ability to reproduce development, QA and production conditions, deployment night will be much less stressful and much shorter.
