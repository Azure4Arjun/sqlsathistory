## Speaker: A.J. Mee
## Title: Analysis Services - Multidimensional vs. PowerPivot vs. Tabular/BISM
## Abstract:
### Remember the days when Analysis Services solely represented an OLAP engine?  Are you unclear about when to still build cubes vs. invoke the new Tabular engine in SSAS?  Do you feel confused about where the self-service capabilities of PowerPivot end and where enterprise BI begins?  If you answered YES to any of those questions, please join A.J. Mee (Principal BI Specialist at Microsoft) for some practical, real-world guidance around the three modes of SQL Server Analysis Services.  As with most of A.J.'s presentations, the vast majority of the time will be spent providing demonstrations of the technology.  Both traditional (i.e. relational) and non-traditional (i.e. unstructured/semi-structured) data sources may be incorporated into the demonstrations.
