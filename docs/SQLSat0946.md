Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Warner Chaves
## Title: Architecting a Modern Business Intelligence Data Platform
## Abstract:
### The power of cloud storage and compute power has made data warehousing and big data possible for businesses of all sizes. What was once a large capital expenditure and multi-year implementation can now be deployed and ready to use within minutes and allow any organization to collect, query and discover insights from their structured and unstructured data sources. 

With tightly integrated services and a user-centric approach, a cloud-native data platform can fit transparently into your business data strategy and leverage already existing and familiar development and management skills.
 
In this session we will look at the main components and reference architectures for building a modern business intelligence platform that includes data warehousing, big data and analytics with examples using Microsoft Azure. We will talk about ways to integrate with on-premises systems as well as lessons learned from building these Enterprise BI Data Platforms for multiple clients.

# Build a Modern Data Warehouse with Apache Spark and SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#946-South-Florida-BI-Edition-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: LATAM ( BI topics in Spanish)
## Speaker: oscar garcia
## Title: Build a Modern Data Warehouse with Apache Spark and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A data warehouse (DW) is a core component of business intelligence and a central data repository for different sources. This poses many challenges as the schema definition for those sources may be completely different from one another. In this presentation, we discuss how to create a data warehouse model that can support data from multiple systems. Oscar Garcia shows how to build a dimensional model which can enable us to import the data with different shapes into a data warehouse. We then create processes to transform and load the data using Apache Spark. We finally use Power BI to visualize the data from our data warehouse and Spark.


Learning Objectives:

Challenges when using disparate data sources (different models)

Define a common model to support the different model shapes (Star Schema)

Apache Spark Overview

Strategy for loading the different data-sets into the common model

Data analysis and visualization with Power BI

# What is the Power Query Editor?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#946-South-Florida-BI-Edition-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Jessica Jolly
## Title: What is the Power Query Editor?
## Abstract:
### How often do you get data that is perfectly tailored and ready to use in a Power BI report?
Less often than you could hope. There is a rule of thumb that says 80% of the work required to 
create a report (or a dashboard) involves cleaning and prepping the data. This is accentuated 
when you consider that 90% of the time, if you are having a problem with a visual in a report, 
it is because something is awry in the data model. In other words, it all starts with clean, well prepared data. This is why you need to become familiar with the Power Query Editor. 
In this session, we will cover:
--What is the Power Query Editor?
--How do you access it?
--What does it do that nothing else does?
--When would you use it?
--How hard is it to use? 
--A quick demo of PQE's capabilities

# "There Be Whales Here!" -- Big Data in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#946-South-Florida-BI-Edition-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Aaron Cutshall
## Title: "There Be Whales Here!" -- Big Data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Due to varying definitions of Big Data which confuse data volume and data organization, the common perception is that Big Data requires the use of Hadoop, MongoDB, or another NoSQL database.Â  SQL Server can easily store and manipulate very large volumes of data and perform quite well provided the database is properly set up and tuned.Â  In this session we'll cover some of the definitions and misconceptions of Big Data, look at some Big Data solutions that went horribly wrong and review a case where Big Data was successfully implemented in SQL Server.  Finally, we'll take a peek under the covers to see how SQL Server best handles Big Data through proper data models, table designs, performance tuning, and T-SQL techniques.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Data Virtualization with PolyBase
## Abstract:
### PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.

# Power BI Dataset Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#946-South-Florida-BI-Edition-2020)
Event Date: 22-02-2020 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Armando Lacerda
## Title: Power BI Dataset Tuning
## Abstract:
### Most Power BI reports rely on a small dataset. And due to a lighting fast data engine most data model mistakes are shadowed by the speed of the service. When the dataset gets bigger then best data modeling practices are required. The trick here is Power BI data engine is not relational and therefore most data modeling techniques either donâ€™t apply or donâ€™t deliver. In this session we will go over how to model and measure performance for larger Power BI datasets.
