## Title: How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment
## Abstract:
### Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any areas that may be impacting performance or security. During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. During this session we will cover a number of additional tools that can be used, include the Vulnerability Assessment Tool and a suite of 125 SSRS reports the return key data needed in a manner easier to read and export.
