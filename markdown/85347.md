## Title: Exploring the SQL Server Powershell Module
## Abstract:
### A big hurdle for using Powershell and SQL Server together is the SQLPS module. Both old and new users of Powershell don’t completely understand its capabilities. In this session, we’ll talk about the cmdlets you may not know about, tricks to save time using the provider, and even a few gotchas on how the provider works that can save you some time and energy. When we’re finished, you will have a deeper understanding of how you can use SQL Server and Powershell together.
