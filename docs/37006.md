## Title: Clusters Your Way: #SANLess clusters for physical, virtual  cloud environments
## Abstract:
### Abstract: SQL Server MVP Geoff Hiten will discuss how to create #SANLess clusters in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible: specifically local high performance clusters leveraging SSD/Flash-based storage and clustering in the cloud - no SAN (or SAN Admin required). He will also touch upon cost-effective disaster recovery options without the need for SAN replication.
