## Title: SSAS Tabular and PowerPivot - Choose Your Own Adve
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover how SSAS tabular and PowerPivot compliment each other and make the slicing and dicing of large amounts of data a breeze for Power Users. I will give a brief explanation and history of each, then will let the audience choose their own adventure in creating a SSAS tabular model or PowerPivot model from scratch. I will walk everyone through how to import data into it, create data relationships from a regular database model, then expose the elements from the model for users to slice and dice data with ease with a Pivot table then a Power View visualization.  I will demonstrate a few DAX commands that are very powerful yet very easy.
