## Title: Wait-Time SQL Server Performance Management
## Abstract:
### There are many ways to use SQL Server Wait types for performance tuning of a Microsoft database, but often there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait event data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait event data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using wait type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.
