## Title: Databases for mobile
## Abstract:
### You are a Windows Phone developer or just a mobile developer and you need locally a database, what are your options? What you can do, what you cannot do, and how? How cloud is changing this story?  With focus on Windows Phone (the easiest to demo, but not ignoring the “others”) these are a few of the questions this presentation will try to answer. Of course all with as much demoes and code as possible.
