## Speaker: Adam Machanic
## Title: SQL Server Parallelism and Performance
## Abstract:
### Over the past five years, multi-core processors have made the jump from semi-obscure to commonplace in the data center. Today we regularly expect to see 16, 32, or 64 cores in even our lower-end servers. Are you getting everything you can out of the wealth of processing power at your disposal? Attend this session to take a detailed look at how and why SQL Server processes queries in parallel, as well as methods for controlling parallel processing via configuration options, the Resource Governor, and query-level hints. This session will enable you to immediately evaluate, understand, and improve the state of parallel processing on your servers. .

Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI Track 2
## Speaker: Audrey Hammonds
## Title: Database Makeover: Renovate Your Data Model
## Abstract:
### You know the concepts of normalization, logical modeling, and physical implementation. But what happens when you’ve inherited a less than perfect data model? You need to renovate while keeping the production system humming. In this session, we’ll talk about how to evaluate an existing model, how to approach design when your system is up and running and how to incrementally apply database design changes in a fast-moving environment. Every database, even ones consisting of a collection of flat, unrelated tables, has the potential to become a beautiful database. All you need is an eye for design and a strategy to get you there.

# Inside SQL Server Wait Types
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track 2
## Speaker: Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server Wait Types
## Abstract:
### Have you ever encountered a wait type with SQL Server but can’t find any information on what it means? Perhaps you have thought the meaning of these is hidden away somewhere in a dark closet? In this talk, we will explore the internals of wait types within the SQL Server Engine. Rather than cover some of the more common wait types such as lock and latches, we will explore the more advanced and obscure wait types that may be surfaced by the engine. The ones you can’t find much information about.
#  
#### SessionID: 29129
# Inside SQL Server Latches
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track 2
## Speaker: Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server Latches
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server database engine uses latches for internal synchronization to critical operations. So why would you care about what a latch is? Well, if you have ever monitored a SQL Server closely, you know you can’t escape latches. Come to this advanced session exploring the internals of how SQL Server uses the concept of latches for synchronization of key internal data structures. This talk is a very advanced “500” session that may include the use of advanced diagnostics such the Windows debugger and discussion of Windows APIs. I will assume the audience has a basic working knowledge of the SQL Server engine including an understanding of some of the more common SQL Server Engine DMVs such as sys.dm_exec_sessions, sys.dm_exec_requests

# Are you a Linchpin? Career management lessons...

## Speaker: Brian Moran
## Title: Are you a Linchpin? Career management lessons...
## Abstract:
### Full title is "Are you a Linchpin? Career management lessons to help you become indispensible."

Are consultants better that people who work for ‘regular’ companies? Perhaps it is the other way around? No classification of IT worker is inherently smarter or better than another. However, I believe that many successful SQL Server professionals share similar characteristics that shape their careers and success. Of course they have interesting differences as well! This session explores 20 years of my ideas, learning, and research on this topic. The session also shares the experience of several top SQL Server professions as they share personal thoughts on what has made them indispensible. This is a panel session.

## Speaker: Brian Moran
## Title: Leadership Coaching: A repeatable methodology...
## Abstract:
### Leadership Coaching: A repeatable methodology for Leadership Development.

Leadership coaching is the practice of using relational influence, the people kind, not the database kind ?, to develop and empower adult leaders. Coaching embraces a set of structured techniques designed to help you make other people more effective in reaching their goals and developing as leaders and is very different from mentoring or counseling and is being embraced more and more by management guru’s around the world.  Do you have a systematic approach for developing yourself as a leader? Do you have a systematic approach for investing in and equipping the next generation... (I will edit this to fit...)

## Speaker: Dean Richards
## Title: Monitoring SQL Server in a VMware Environment
## Abstract:
### SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

# Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
## Abstract:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more will be discussed

## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on
the market. But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy. And it doesn’t mean that
database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since SQL Server is constantly
growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues
that others had tackled and solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails
of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. In
fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?

## Title: Iceberg, Dead Ahead!
## Abstract:
### What does a plane crash have to do with technical skills? You might be surprised.  There are many lessons to be learned from disasters. Most accidents are caused not by one factor, but by a series of seemingly-small missteps; It’s the same for us.  Even if a freak accident occurs, training and preparation can make all the difference; it's the same for us.  In this session we’ll discuss as a group some real-life disasters and see what skills, attitudes and thought processes we can take back to our day jobs. We'll look at a handful of aviation disasters and look for patterns of behavior at fault or that saved the day. Hopefully you'll leave looking for those behaviors in yourself and on your project teams. Fasten your seatbelt!

Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI Track 2
## Speaker: Melissa Coates
## Title: Dashboards...How to Choose Which MSBI Tool?
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft BI stack has a few choices for visualization.  We will explore options, flexibility, limitations, and ease of use for creating dashboards  scorecards with:
  * PerformancePoint Services 2010
  * Reporting Services 2008 R2
  * SharePoint Server 2010
  * PowerPivot
  * Crescent.

This session will be a fun one!  We will compare and contrast options available in each tool, such as:  charts, gauges, maps, indicators, sparklines, data bars, and decomposition trees.  The goal is to determine when you might choose one tool in the Microsoft BI stack versus another.

# PowerShell: Are you checking out my profile?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Powershell
## Speaker: Nicholas Cain
## Title: PowerShell: Are you checking out my profile?
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is a very powerful management tool and you can spend hours writing magical scripts to provide automation for frequently run tasks. Often forgotten is the PowerShell profile, a place you can add your own functions which can provide you lightning fast access to information. 
In this session we'll talk about the power a profile puts at your fingertips. I will also demo (and share) several PowerShell functions that I use frequently for common tasks like checking database backups and disk space. 
I'll show you my PowerShell profile if you show me yours.

Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Powershell
## Speaker: Nicholas Cain
## Title: Centralized auditing of permissions with SQL Serve
## Abstract:
### As a DBA it can be a challenge to know who has permissions to what SQL instances and what objects. The more instances you have the more complex that task. In this presentation I'll share a method using PowerShell and TSQL that can be used to capture permissions from all of your SQL instances and load them into a centralized location. We'll even take it a step further by auditing those permissions so that we can quickly and easily identify any that might have changed.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them. (But they deserved it!) Learn how to: create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!

## Speaker: Sarah Barela
## Title: The 4-hour DBA: Automate, Audit and Relax
## Abstract:
### Do you feel that you are overworked and always fighting fires and never can get ahead? In this session, I will help you identify what is important to your job and how to find the time to address those critical tasks.  I will share scripts to automate those tasks that are central to all DBAs and discuss how to establish a methodology to quickly automate daily database chores.  The flip side of automation is auditing.  Routine auditing your server is essential to avoid nasty surprises that can lead to a loss of control.  We will create an auditing system using features within SQL Server, including Policy Based Management and scripts that will provide you peace of mind to enjoy your work and maybe even life beyond the office.

# SQL Server XML 201
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: SQL Server XML 201
## Abstract:
### The xml datatype in SQL Server expands the potential of the relational platform to store increasingly complex forms of data, but without the use of the appropriate query language, much of that potential can remain unused. This session will cover the basics of SQL Server XQuery and FLWOR; the assumption is that attendees will have some basic exposure to XML (including the use of XML in SQL Server). Learn how to "run queries within a query", and how to extract XML data into a tabular format. Coverage will include the five basic XML methods (.exist(), .value(), .query(), .nodes(), and .modify()) and FLWOR (for, let, where, order by, and return).

# It's TEMPDB Why Should You Care
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Professional Dev
## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It's TEMPDB Why Should You Care
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right?  It is installed by default and gets recreated each time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right?  WRONG.  This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

# Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#89---Atlanta-2011)
Event Date: 17-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI Track 2
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube
## Abstract:
### Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to some organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.
