## Speaker: David Gonzalez
## Title: A simple framework for presenting complex data. 
## Abstract:
### Your data is spring-loaded with possibilities. How you present your data can build — or break — relationships. You have 2 choices; either, develop a strategy to make your big data meaningful, or bury your audience with boring data and trust that the gods will clean up the mess. The choice is yours; eyes open or closed.
