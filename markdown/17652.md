## Title: 7 Great things you can do to improve and manage customer relationships
## Abstract:
### In the eyes of accountants, your a cost to a customer, period and end of discussion. So why do I always mention "We are a profit center" to my clients every chance we get? How do you handle a late project? How do you break bad news to a client, (Hint: With good news first). This and other highly effective management techniques are waiting for you at my session. So don't go to another Reporting Services session and instead come and learn how to improve and gain new business...unless you only do reporting services of course.
