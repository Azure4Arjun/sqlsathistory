## Title: Database Modeling In Practice
## Abstract:
### Many times we had created databases according to KISS principle – small set of objects, 3rd NF. Then they were getting more complex, and less efficient. We had to add more features to application, reporting, logging, history lookups. Someday the database became a mess. Oh! If I had known all the demands the day I'd made the first table, I'd have offered a better solution...
In this session, we look at some issues that arise in database modeling. We'll try to look at a database from different angles – model, implementation, performance, application that works with that database and business value. We'll touch a logical and physical design, and such things like an "entity vs attribute" problem, denormalization, table splitting, strategy of primary key implementation, how to provide history of data changes, archiving, etc. 
This session would give you some thoughts and ideas about what to consider when you create a database.
