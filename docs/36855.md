## Title: Do You Have A Case Of Mistaken IDENTITY?
## Abstract:
### When creating a table most people use an identity value as the primary key without a second thought. We also take for granted than returning the identity value when a row is inserted "just works"...but it's not as straightforward as it seems - you might have a case of mistaken identity! In this session we'll look at several ways to return identity values, compare identity values with sequences, demonstrate how you can end up with unexpected identity values, and learn how to make sure you've got the right ones every time.
