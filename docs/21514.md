## Title: PowerShell, the New SQL Hammer
## Abstract:
### You've seen all the amazing scripts that use PowerShell, but writing your own is raising more questions. This session will help fill in the gaps by explaining all the moving parts of PowerShell 2.0, the integration with SQL Server and answer the following questions as well as others. Why is Invoke-Sqlcmd necessary? What is and why is there a Minishell for SQL Server? What makes the SQLSERVER: PS Drive so powerful? How does a remote SQL Server get added to the SQLSERVER: PS Drive?
