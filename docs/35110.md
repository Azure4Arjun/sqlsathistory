## Title: XML and Relational Databases
## Abstract:
### Well established relational database principles help us decide when and how to use the XML features in SQL Server. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of first normal form ("1NF") and how to apply 1NF to XML related database design choices. If you think (like many DBAs) that XML is a curse or (like some developers) that XML is a cure-all, this presentation is for you. Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we should do over just a list of features and syntax.
