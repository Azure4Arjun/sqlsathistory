## Title: Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions 
## Abstract:
### Every data warehouse needs a date dimension to help users slice and dice data. What should be included in the dimension, what is enough and what is too much? Should you use the wizard to generate the dimension for you; what are the advantages and disadvantages? We will explore a generic date dimension load script, loading a custom table and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time dimension. Finally we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make an Order Date, Ship Date, Received Date exposed to users as opposed to multiple date dimensions.
