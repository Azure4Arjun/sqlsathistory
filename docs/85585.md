## Title: The Secrets of Partitioning
## Abstract:
### The magic of Partitioning will be revealed. The session will cover the basics of partitioning a table including all the decisions you'll need to make when youâ€™re creating your first. Additionally, I'll demonstrate how to add, alter and remove partitions. Plus explore other features that are available.  Demos will include using both the SSMS GUI and/or T-SQL Scripts as we build a table partition and handle all the expected maintenance and normal operations you may encounter.
