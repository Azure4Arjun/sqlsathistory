## Title: Stretch Database and Managed Backups: Cloud Services for your SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Utilizing Azure cloud services does not mean moving all of your data or control away from your on-premises SQL Servers.  In this session we will cover the new SQL 2016 Stretch Database and the SQL 2014 Managed Backups to Azure features.  We will look at use-cases and limitations of both features to illustrate how these cloud services may fit into your current SQL Server environment.
