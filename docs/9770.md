## Title: The Secret Life of an INSERT Statement
## Abstract:
### Follow the life of an INSERT statement from the moment it is issued by the Client, through reception, parsing and execution by the SQL Server engine, until the operation is completed and a message is sent back.

This is an Internals session where we will touch on all the different components that comprise the SQL Server Database Engine involved in handling a single INSERT statement. Watch structures on memory and disk get updated, and geek out on details!
