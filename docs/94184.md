## Title: Four questions machine learning can answer
## Abstract:
### AI and machine learning are powerful tools! But as with all powerful tools you have to use them to solve the right problem: Even the most powerful hammer cannot do what a simple screwdriver can.

The aim of this talk is to help you identify business opportunities in which machine learning can help.
You will see four broad types of business problems for which machine learning can be the right tool for the job.

The next step will be to find answers to these questions. Azure provides many different ways to apply machine learning. In this session you will see demos of 4 different Azure services which can help you answer the questions: Cognitive services, ML Studio, SQL Server ML Services and Databricks.
