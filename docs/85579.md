## Title: Managing SQL Server on Windows Server Core
## Abstract:
### Lately it seems more sysadmins are embracing Windows Server Core as the OS of choice for virtualized servers. SQL Server is (almost) perfectly happy to run in this environment but how do you manage on an OS without a full desktop.

We'll cover what versions and features are supported, how to install sql server via a configuration file,  and what common activities are changed when you move into a Core environment.
