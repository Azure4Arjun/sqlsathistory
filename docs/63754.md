## Title: SQL Server - R Services
## Abstract:

With the first Microsoft Data Science summit behind us this past Sept, in Atlanta, let us review what R Services in SQL Server brings to the table and see how it complements/supersedes features that are available with other R offerings (R GUI, Microsoft R Client [R Studio], Microsoft R Open [RROpen], Microsoft R Server[RREnterprise] etc.,)
