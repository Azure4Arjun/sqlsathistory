## Title: Loading the Windows Azure Cloud 
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure provides many options for storing data. SQL Azure is one of Windows Azure’s solutions for working with relational data. If you are familiar with SQL Server, SQL Azure will be a natural extension of your knowledge and skills. 
In this session, we will look at the different options for loading data to the Cloud from an on premise SQL server and vice versa. Topics we will cover include: 
1)	SQL Azure Data Sync - Migrate data from an existing on-premise SQL Server database to SQL Azure and bi-directional data synchronization and data management capabilities allowing data to be easily shared across SQL Azure databases across multiple data centers.  
2)	 BACPAC – Importing and Exporting the BACPAC
3)	CDC  - loading the Data to cloud by capturing the incremental Changes at ON-Premise (SSIS)
4)	Finally, we will query the System Views for the data movement.
What you will learn:
•	Overview of SQL Azure
•	SQL Azure Data Sync
•	BACPAC
•	Incremental Load to Cloud
