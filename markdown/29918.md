## Title: Adopt, Discover and Improve
## Abstract:
### The current job market is extremely competitive. Unfortunately getting the job offer is not enough â€“new employees are expected to delivering ROI immediately. It becomes critical for them to take an ownership of the system in a matter of days to keep the position they won. 

This session shows how to analyze the system state using wait statistics, DMO and performance counters. It demonstrates how specific resource bottlenecks relate to design and code issues, shows how to pinpoint the most problematic queries and detect anti-patterns and design issues in the system

The session is targeted to both DBAs and Developers who want to become familiar with the necessary techniques helping to take an ownership and detect issues in the system.
