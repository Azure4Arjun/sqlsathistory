## Title: Azure SQL Database (Software As A Service)
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of installing, configuring and patching Microsoft SQL Server? Azure SQL database maybe a way to move some of your existing infrastructure to the cloud. 

Depending upon your companies philosophy, it might be great for development, testing, and possibly production environments.

The exciting thing about this service is that new features will be released on this platform first before trickling down to the on-premise editions.

The demonstration will show how to create and load a new database from scratch using the Azure Portal, SSMS and BCP.
