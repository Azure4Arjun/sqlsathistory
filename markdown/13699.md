## Title: Backup Strategies are for Losers!
## Abstract:
### Every company has a backup strategy.  That backup strategy is worthless and will cause your business to fail miserably while losing valuable customer data, protected HIPAA information, and MY social security number.  Because of that, Peggy will be bankrupting my credit report. In this session you will learn: what is a recovery strategy,
creating your recovery point and recovery time objectives, selecting the proper backup type and recovery model, and then we will be putting it all together into a winning strategy!
