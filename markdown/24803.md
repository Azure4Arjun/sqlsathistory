## Title: SQL Injection and Other Forms of Attacks
## Abstract:
### SQL Injection is still one of the biggest reasons various websites and applications get hacked. In this session we'll look at how would an attacker go about using SQL Injection to gain full access to your server. But there are also other forms of attacks like XSS, CSRF and social engineering attacks. We'll see how those works too.  This is usually an eye opening session for developers as to what is possible and how to exploit it.
