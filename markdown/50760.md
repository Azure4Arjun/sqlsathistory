## Title: Window Functions- Get OVER it!
## Abstract:
### Window functions can be powerful and simple to use. In this session we will go over many practical uses of window functions to provide powerful analytics while performing extremely well compared to traditional methods of pulling data. First we will cover the syntax and use of ranking window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, and NTILE). Next we will cover aggregate window functions and offset functions (LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE, and LAST_VALUE). Finally we will cover window analytic/distribution functions (PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST, PERCENTILE_DISC, and PERCENTILE_CONT).

This session will be filled with examples and practical applications of window functions in analytics.
