## Title: Data Vault 2.0 An Agile BI DB Design Method
## Abstract:
### Dan Linstedt, the creator of Data Vault 2.0, describes it as follows: The Data Vault Model is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of business. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and star schema. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise. Data Vault 2.0 is not an app but a database modeling methodology that overcomes many of the shortcomings of DW modeling. Data vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys from the descriptive attributes of those keys. This presentation will go over the basic parts of the Data Vault 2.0 model along with examples of each.
