## Speaker: Andrew Nielsen
## Title: VMware Technologies and Microsoft SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Historically running Microsoft SQL Server on VMware vSphere has been a major benefit to all users of SQL Server.  The tremendous capabilities both in resource management and mobility innate in the vSphere platform creates an application stack of unparalleled value.  Now VMware has expanded its technology offerings into the full Software Defined Datacenter and the Hybrid Cloud.  Starting with the VMware offering of the VMware Cloud on AWS, which we presented last year at this event, VMware Technologies through the umbrella idea of “VMware Cloud Foundation” runs on many pubic cloud offerings including Microsoft Azure.  In this keynote the VMware Sr. Director of  Cloud Platform Product Marketing Andrew Nielsen will discuss the present and future of MS SQL Server and VMware Technologies.
