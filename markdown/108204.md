## Title: What’s in the Cloud for my Datawarehouse
## Abstract:
### There are several reasons to look at the Azure Cloud for your DW: Elasticity and price, You plan to put your data sources or data consumers in the Cloud or you have non-relational data types to store and process on top of your existing datawarehouse. But there are so many questions on the way and before even taking this journey. Where to start and how to plan the movement? Which service to use for the DW in the Cloud? How to move and run ETL packages in the cloud? Should you migrate to Azure Synapse or should you use different Data Store? Let’s get the things in order and let’s try to make the path of this journey a bit more clear by answering all those questions.
