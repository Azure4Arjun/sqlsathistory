## Title: Understand Evaluation Contexts in DAX
## Abstract:
### DAX is the query and programming language for future Microsoft BI solutions, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row contexts and filter contexts are and how to access them. You will learn functions which create row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial contexts of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial contexts are created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter contexts using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.
