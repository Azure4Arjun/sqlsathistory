## Title: Python and R Integration with SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### If you are looking to expand your DBA or developer skills, statistics with Python or R integrated with SQL Server 2017 might be a path worth examining. This session will go through the installation of these options with SQL Server 2017. Then, we will configure the scripting Stored Procedures. Finally, the session will conclude with statistical graphs and analysis with both R and Python.

The role as a DBA is expanding, and even though you might not be a Data Scientist, you can still use the new features of SQL Server 2017 to do an analysis of performance monitoring data to enhance the predictability of proactive analysis on your current systems.
