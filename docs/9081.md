## Title: Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies
## Abstract:
### When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.
