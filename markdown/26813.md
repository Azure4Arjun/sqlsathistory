## Title: Windowing Functions
## Abstract:
### Window functions are one of the coolest new things in SQL Server 2012, but they can be tricky to figure out. In this session we'll talk about how windows functions work and why you should start using them. This is going to be a demo heavy session with code samples you can take back to work and start using Monday morning!
