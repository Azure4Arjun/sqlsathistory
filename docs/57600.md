## Title: Power BI with Narrative Science: Look Who's Talking!
## Abstract:
### You’ve created many Power BI reports and have become very skillful in connecting different data sources; your data model is filled with all necessary measures, calculated columns and eventually your Power BI report with various powerful visualizations is presented to your customers. What’s next? What if you can add some artificial intelligence to your report? 

There is a Chicago-based company Narrative Science that has developed a very unique component that can consume your report model numeric data and automatically generate textual narratives within your Power BI report. Such natural language descriptions can provide you with some unexpected insights and extend your common data interpretation. 

Let’s go together though this interactive data adventure and explore different scenarios of how this Narrative Science component can be used with your Power BI reports and check if it can also be used for Predictive Analytics.
