## Title: Adding Power to the DBA toolkit!
## Abstract:
### Interested in being able to manage, monitor and document your SQL Environment from a single location? Want to be able to produce modern interactive reports and dashboards that can be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices? 

By adding a little "Power" to your DBA toolkit you can!

By combining PowerShell and PowerBi with the more traditional DBA tools I will show how to query and document your entire environment and produce rich interactive reports that can be consumed by all levels of your organisation.
