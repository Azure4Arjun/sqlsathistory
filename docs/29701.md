## Speaker: Daniel Rosales
## Title: GOD, good object design
## Abstract:
### Come learn how to effectively use UML in your everday implementations. As VS2010 boasts UML support right from within the IDE with an array of UML compliant diagrams, we will stick to the whiteboard and avoid the technology. This is meant to force us to think through a problem together as a team and arrive at a common understanding. If there is time left, Danny will open up the IDE and actually implement whatever design the team arrived at. Come learn UML notation and more importantly, good object design!
