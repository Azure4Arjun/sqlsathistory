## Title: What secrets does your table schema hold?
## Abstract:
### Data types are the basic building blocks of table design. Using the correct data type can affect data integrity and performance.  Redesign after a table is in production is very difficult, so getting it right when building the table is crucial. 

We begin with discussion on best practices for choosing data types and why the right data type is important for performance and data integrity. We will then run scripts to spotlight inconsistent field lengths and data types as examples of secrets that will be revealed. 

This session will help you design better tables so your data is more stable and reliable. It is also a good review if you will be taking exam 70-461.
