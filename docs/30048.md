## Speaker: Aaron Allison
## Title: SQL Driven Mobile Platforms
## Abstract:
### A brief introduction and explanation of MofuMobi, a new mobile business tool developed by Aaron and his team.  This mobile platform is driven by SQL Queries, enabling users to extend any internal software system to their smart phones.  This session will show viewers how easy it is to create their very own custom apps within the MofuMobi portal and what kind of functionalities it is capable of, for instance updating users with new apps (reports within apps) without having to update phones.  If you can write SQL Queries or views than you can develop MofuMobi apps.
