## Speaker: David Thole
## Title: Introduction to Data Analysis in R
## Abstract:
### This session will cover the bare essentials about getting started with R.  I'll go over what R is, why it's a thing, how to make use of it, and current industry trends.  While I won't be able to teach everything you need to know about how to use R in this session, my goal is to get attendees down the right path.  I will show a number of examples, and discuss how R deals with data.
