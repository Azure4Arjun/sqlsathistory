## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS via Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced.  In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs.
