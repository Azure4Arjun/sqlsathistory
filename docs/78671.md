## Title: Developing Graph structures with the CosmosDB Gremlin API
## Abstract:
### Analysing highly connected data using SQL is hard! Relational databases were simply not designed  to handle this,  but graph databases were.  Built from the ground up to understand highly connected data, graph databases enable a flexible performant way to interrogate and traverse highly connected data. 

If you have looked at graph processing in SQL Server then you will know it has limitations. Well Microsoft developer has a few alternatives, one of those being the Gremlin API in CosmosDB. In this session, we seek to explore, what is a graph database, why you should be interested, what query patterns does they solve and how to use Gremiln's fantastic language.
