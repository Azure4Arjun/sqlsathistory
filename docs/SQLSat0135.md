# Better Together: Merge, Partitioning, ColumnStore 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Server
## Speaker: Greg Low
## Title: Better Together: Merge, Partitioning, ColumnStore 
## Abstract:
### Most SQL Server sessions are based around individual features but SQL Server really shines when you start to combine features. In this session, Greg will provide an introduction to ColumnStore indexes, review Table Partitioning and Merge and show how to combine these features to improve query performance while still being able to load data warehouse data quickly.

# If you had $10K what would you spend it on?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Mixed
## Speaker: Peter Ward
## Title: If you had $10K what would you spend it on?
## Abstract:
### You are looking at the Bill of Materials for the new shiny server that you are going to purchase for SQL Server and you realise that there is still $10,000 in the hardware budget - how do you spend it?  Do you increase the core density, maybe increase the RAM or maybe even look at adding some solid state storage to the storage array.  In this session we will explore how some small hardware investments made in the right place can pimp your next SQL Server deployment.

# The Dark Art of Performance Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Server
## Speaker: Peter Ward
## Title: The Dark Art of Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### Despite all of the enhancements to the instrumentation in SQL Server, many database professionals still view performance tuning as a dark art.  This session will provide database administrators and developers with valuable information on SQL Server performance tuning concepts.  This presentation will walk you through proven performance tuning strategies and teach you how to use SQL Server tools to identify a performance bottleneck, isolate the root cause, apply possible resolutions, and then quantify performance improvements.

# Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence 
## Speaker: Paul te Braak
## Title: Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
## Abstract:
### Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language).

# Query Tuning Using Lessons Learned from SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Mixed
## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Query Tuning Using Lessons Learned from SSIS
## Abstract:
### I'm sure you've noticed the similarities between an execution plan and an SSIS Data Flow Task. Of course there are major differences, such as the fact that you write Data Flow Tasks, whereas execution plans are created based on the T-SQL that you pass to the Query Optimizer and other things such as indexes, statistics and constraints. This talk will consider some of the things that SSIS developers look for when creating an effective Data Flow Task, and show you how those same concerns can be considered when writing queries.

# Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Server
## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
## Abstract:
### There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.

# The MERGE Statement - T-SQL's Swiss Army Knife
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#135---Brisbane-2012)
Event Date: 12-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence 
## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: The MERGE Statement - T-SQL's Swiss Army Knife
## Abstract:
### Despite being around since SQL Server 2008 MERGE is one of the most underappreciated features in T-SQL. In many ways it's the Swiss Army Knife, able to be used in many different situations. It's not without it's frustrations though, and you'll see both sides of this useful tool in this presentation.
