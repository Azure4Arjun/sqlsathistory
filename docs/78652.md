## Title: Azure PaaS Databases - The Choice is Yours
## Abstract:
### From the beginnings of Azure SQL DB, we now have Elastic Pools, Managed Instances and even MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB. How do you work out which offering is the right one for you and once you have decided, how do you then ensure that you are looking after it adequately?
The choice night be easy for the non-SQL Server PaaS, but the choice for SQL Server between SQL DB, Elastic Pools and Managed Instances can become, well, "cloudy".
This session will explore the features available to each option to help guide you through the first part. We'll then look at what to do once you have your PaaS database deployed â€“ what can you use to manage it and what maintenance tools are available in the service for each flavour.
