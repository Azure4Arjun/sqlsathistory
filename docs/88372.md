## Title: A wild SQL server appears - Real world SQL server triage.
## Abstract:
### Finance is crying, a random SQL server is running slow, and now it's your problem.
How do you now go about looking for what the likely cause of the bad behavior might be?
You are an accidental/junior/mid-level DBA and now the pressure is on.
In this session we will look at Triage â€“ where is it hurting, and how much is it hurting. We will touch on some techniques, tools and quick fixes that will buy you some more time and maybe even resolve the problem.
