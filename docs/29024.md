## Speaker: Benjamin Muller
## Title: Discussion-Time Analytics: BI for smart meetings
## Abstract:
### Tired of supposedly data-driven discussions that quickly devolve into anarchy, finger pointing, and second guessing? This session will show you how to use new and improved SQL Server 2012 BI capabilities, including PowerPivot v2 and Power View to clear the FUD and get your meetings back on track.  We will discuss principals for creating effective, business-oriented BISM models, and visualization techniques that emphasize clarity and usability.
