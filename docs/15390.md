## Title: ETL Frameworks with Dynamic SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### In the ideal world, all information and structures are static, but in the real world almost everything is dynamic, and so many tables are affected by the changes of multiple applications and developers.

If you have just a couple of objects to take care off, then it is all fine and easy to handle, but if you are working with 100's or 1000's of tables, will you try to edit all your SSIS packages manually?

Join me to discover some ways to develop some simple ETL frameworks which can help handling some real world challenges, and learn how you can do some simple running without that much work.

The only existing constant in the nature is the change, so we better be ready to face it.
