## Title: Conan the Librarian: "Put your data sources into Azure Data Catalog, or ELSE!"
## Abstract:
### Are all the sources of data in your organization well documented and easily discovered? Can someone new to your organization find out who is the knowledge expert on your data sources? Is it clear who they should contact to request access to a data source? Do your data sources clearly describe their meaning? 
If you want to answer YES to all these questions, you should come to this session! 
We'll cover the basics of Azure Data Catalog - registering data sources, adding metadata and documentation, tags, and experts. And we'll discuss the scenarios that it is intended to address.
