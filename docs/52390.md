## Title: (PL) Diving into hyperspace - how to make better OLAP calculation
## Abstract:
### Fully additive measures and simple x minus y plus z formulas exist only in simple cubes. Business requirements are growing at very high rate. Complicated calculations with many conditions are needed - for months divide by 30, for quarters by 90, for years by...no... for years display nothing etc. And what about what-if analysis, simulations? The solution is only one. You must become an MDX Hero and dive deeply into multidimensional space of your cube. In my session I will present some real life analytical examples utilizing the SCOPE instruction - a truly hyperdrive for SSAS developer.
