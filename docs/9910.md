## Title: Conquer Reporting By Scaling Out SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this session I will go over how to separate your systems for transactional databases, and for reporting.  I will lightly cover how this can be done with mirroring, replication, which one is right for your situation. Then deep dive into replication, the agents it creates and their purpose, provide tips, best practices, and dispel any fears you may have heard or validate them.
