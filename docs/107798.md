## Title: Intro to CDS inside of Power Automate (fka Microsoft Flow)
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft Common Data Service lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Data within Common Data Service is stored within a set of entities. An entity is a set of records used to store data, similar to how a table stores data within a database.

Learn how the CDS ties into Power Automate (Flow), what Triggers and actions are available and how you can use this all.
