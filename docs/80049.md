## Title: Machine Learning and SQL Server - A match made in heaven?
## Abstract:
### In order to do machine learning you need data and you need algorithms. Instead of having your data and machine learning code in separate environments who not just do everything in SQL Server 2017? In this session we are going to have a look at SQL Server Machine Learning Services and see how we can do machine learning in both R and Python directly in SQL Server. What are the ups and downs of doing everything directly in our favorite environment?
