## Title: Introduction to Microsoft Azure DocumentDB
## Abstract:
### Working with JSON data in SQL Server is not natively supported, but it is possible if you transform JSON into relational tables by using a set of functions Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service that natively saves JSON data, filling a major functionality gap.

This session demonstrates how to create a DocumentDB instance in Azure, work with JSON documents, create ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, and create application logic as stored procedures, triggers, and user defined functions (UDFs), using standard JavaScript.
