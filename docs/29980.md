## Title: SQL Server Security 101
## Abstract:
### Securing SQL Server requires an understanding of how a SQL Server instance and its objects are accessed and how permissions for access are granted or not allowed.

This presentation will cover the entire spectrum from service accounts, logins, and users, to granular permissions and encryption.  You should acquire enough understanding to be able to apply the "principle of least privilege" in your own SQL Server environment.

Content:
•	Service accounts
•	Logins and Users
•	Permissions
•	Encryption
•	Some new security features of SQL 2012
