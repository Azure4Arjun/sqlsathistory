## Title: Strategies for solving compliance challenges
## Abstract:
### According to Gartner, more than 80% of companies use sensitive data in dev and test. Hackers view non-production environments as a tempting target since they often have less rigorous security controls.

In this session, youâ€™ll learn about the challenges that we, as technology professionals, face in our software development and administrative work. Learn compliant DevOps strategies for reducing your attack surface area by ensuring you know where sensitive data is located and avoid copying that data to non-production environments.
