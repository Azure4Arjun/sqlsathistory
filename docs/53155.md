## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Index Internals
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll dig into the internal structures of indexes.  We will look at how SQL Server Navigates through the index. We'll look at the various types of pages within the index and how SQL Server uses these different pages to access your data.  We'll look at what happens within the index as data changes.  There will be lots of demos using undocumented commands as we dive into the depths of the database pages.
