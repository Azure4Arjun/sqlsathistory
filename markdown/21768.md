## Title: Why Re-Invent the Wheel?  Build One Solution to Import/ Export Data
## Abstract:
### Most of the projects I work on or have worked on begin with importing some type of data or end with exporting some type of data or both.  Why do we continue to build solutions that include the importing or exporting of data?  Why have we not taken a practical look at how we solve problems in SQL Server and build our own tools to solve repetitive issues?  In this session you will learn some of the practical solutions Iâ€™ve implemented so that I never have to build a SSIS package that imports data to enable me to do the real work on the data; I get to do the fun stuff to the data right away because my import process has already been written, the data has been parsed and validated, and I have my data in a form that I can work with immediately.  I will demonstrate database design (tables, indexes, etc.), SSIS packages, stored procedures, views, and Columnstore Indexes to process data quickly.  Also, I will show a Visual Studio MVC Web application used to manage the solution.
