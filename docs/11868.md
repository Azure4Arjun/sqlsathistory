## Title: Configuring SharePoint Search for an optimal document management experience
## Abstract:
### Search in SharePoint 2013 has many new features to deliver an excellent document management experience.  In this talk, we'll learn how to take advantage of the hard work you have invested in classifying your documents with rich metadata.  Administrators will learn step-by-step how to map crawled properties to managed properties allowing you to query and refine on the data in your site columns.  We'll look in depth at managed property options such as queryable, retrievable, and refinable.  Once we demonstrate the intricacies of property mapping, attendees will learn how to take advantage of them in the Search Center.  We'll create custom result types to display custom data from site columns and we'll configure the refinement panel to allow users to drill down results in ways never before possible.   Finally, we'll show you how to use entity extraction to infer values of metadata allowing you to do refinement.
