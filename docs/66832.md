## Title: Monitoring  Troubleshooting Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### In this session, we look under the covers of availability groups. Various demos show how to analyze functionality and performance in relation to availability groups using DMVs and Extended Events. This includes problem analysis during initial seeding and the subsequent synchronization traffic and its performance overhead on the workload. The aim is to provide a better understanding of the basic mechanisms and their impact on the chosen high-availability infrastructure as well how to use the available, built-in tools for troubleshooting.
