## Title: A refresher on geospatial data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced geospatial data types already in SQL Server 2008, some enhancements followed in version 2012. Today, geo data is used almost everywhere. Time to refresh your memories of geometry and geography!

We'll walk through which data types are supported - from 0 to 2 dimensions, from points to polygons and some more - and see how to get spatial data into and out of SQL Server tables.

Then there are built-in functions to determine relationships between geo objects, such as intersection, inclusion or shortest distance.
And of course there will be examples of practical applications of geospatial data.
