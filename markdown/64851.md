Wow, Power BI is making a tidal wave in the BI industry.  New features are being released regularly, blog posts are flying across twitter.  How can you keep up?  In this full day session I will explain and demonstrate how to implement a full enterprise Power BI solution.  This will include preparing your organizations network for Power BI, deciding if you need to build an SSAS Semantic Model or will the Power BI desktop work as an alternative.  In addition, there will be a few hand-on labs that will help each attendee get started working with both the Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.  Bring your laptop, grab a cup of coffee and get ready to learn.  See the high-level agenda below:
