## Title: VLDBs: Lessons Learned
## Abstract:
### VLDBs (Very Large Databases) play in a different league: common maintenance operations can take much longer to run, and some settings and features that work well on smaller databases become much less effective. These downsides generally have a negative impact on users, however through some creativity and changes in our game plan we can have highly performant VLDBs. This session will cover a wide variety of tips and tricks assembled from years of working with databases up to 40TB in size.
