## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
## Abstract:
### Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

Event Date: 04-05-2019 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care?
## Abstract:
### You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.

# Make Your Maintenance Plans Better and Faster
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#835---Philadelphia-2019)
Event Date: 04-05-2019 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: Make Your Maintenance Plans Better and Faster
## Abstract:
### Maintenance plans are never easy. They get worse as the databases get bigger and the maintenance windows shrink upon pressure from the customers. So, stop struggling with your nightly/weekly database maintenance plans. 
I am going share a case study of a three-terabyte database and how I tweaked my Indexing, backup and restore jobs to help cut down my maintenance window from over eight hours to under 30 minutes. By the end of my session you will be able to shrink the duration of your maintenance plans by as much as 75%. 
You will learn to use parameters like BLOCKSIZE, BUFFERCOUNT and MAXTRANSFERSIZE appropriately with the BACKUP command. You will also see the advantages of native database compression, striped, parallel and staggered backups in combination with a mix of Full/Differential and Log backups.
I will also show you how third party tools like Copy Data Virtualization or Snapshot Mirroring help us cut down our backup and restore times by as much as 95%.

# Data Profiling or Statistics 201
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#835---Philadelphia-2019)
Event Date: 04-05-2019 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Slava Murygin
## Title: Data Profiling or Statistics 201
## Abstract:
### Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.

## Speaker: Joe Wehr
## Title: Entrepreneurship - Are you ready to make it on your own?
## Abstract:
### There's no doubt about it, being an entrepreneur can be very rewarding. However, it is far from easy. So, before you embark on that journey, you have to ask yourself if this is the right thing for you to do. But, how do you know?

Attend this inspiring session by Prof Joe Wehr of the MCCC and discover the good and the bad of becoming an entrepreneur. 

This includes the things everyone needs to know, like
- how to strategize and create a business plan
- how to secure financing
- what to look out for before hiring (hiring mistakes are very costly)

And the less obvious, including
- knowing when and how to get out (retirement, anybody?)
- the not so subtle difference between a consultant and an entrepreneur (this is an eye-opener)
- how to legally extend the reach of your cash (ever heard of multitasking your money?)

If you have been thinking about “it” but aren't sure if you're ready, you need to attend this session. You might be surprised by what you learn about yourself

Event Date: 04-05-2019 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: Intelligent Query Processing
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has evolved many times over the years. SQL Server 2019 introduces "Intelligent Query Processing", greatly enhancing the "Adaptive Query Processing" which was introduced in SQL Server 2017. 
 
Intelligent Query Processing allows your queries to operate more efficiently (resulting in better query performance) - without needing to make changes to the code or the application.

In this session we will explore all of the Intelligent Query Processing features in SQL Server 2019. 

Time permitting, we will go into other changes in recent versions of SQL Server (such as execution plan changes and new Dynamic Management Objects) that will help improve your efficiency at troubleshooting and tuning SQL Server. 
 
Coming away from this session, you will have plenty of reasons to want to upgrade to SQL Server 2019 immediately!

## Speaker: Azhagappan Arunachalam
## Title: SQL Graph
## Abstract:
### Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017 (and 2019), and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft's offering).  Microsoft added SQL Graph features to their 2017 release, and has added support for MERGE (UPSERT) scenarios to ease insertions into edge tables, and Edge Constraints to apply restrictions on relationships between nodes in 2019 release (in CTP 2.0).  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.

## Title: Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals
## Abstract:
### The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.

## Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query
## Abstract:
### Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transform, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition, Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition, we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Staging data for Azure SQL services
## Abstract:
### Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?
## Abstract:
### Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.

# High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#835---Philadelphia-2019)

## Speaker: David Bermingham
## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
## Abstract:
### The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.

For various reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize these new features. In this session, the audience will see demonstrations of the different practical use cases where these features can make T-SQL coding more efficient. This 100% code-based demo session highlights efficiency to utilize the latest T-SQL functions over conventional methods with the same functionality. The session will cover in depth live scenarios where these features have proven performance efficiency, code re
