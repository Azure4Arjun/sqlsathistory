## Title: Layered partitioning in a Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### How does one load a large fact table in a Data Warehouse, when the source system can deliver any chunk of the data at any given time? This session will show how to handle this by using layered partitioning. We will walk through table partitioning, partitioned views, and layered partitioning, as well as go through the management and performance benefits (and challenges) partitioning gives us.
