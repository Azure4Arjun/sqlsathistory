## Title: What's in your Toolbox? 
## Abstract:
### Over the last 3 versions of SQL Server, Microsoft has included a variety of tools which make managing and monitoring SQL Server much easier.  Policy Based Management, the Management Data Warehouse, Central Management Servers, and Utility Control Points all make a DBA's job much easier, particularly if you are responsbile for a large number of instances.  In this session, we will review each of these tools and how they can be implemented in an integrated fashion to provide an enterprise view of your database ecosystem.
