## Title: Securing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Protecting our data from unwanted access is extremely important, wouldn't you agree?
In this session, using lots of demos to ilustrate each situation, I'll cover some pretty relevant topics such as:
Authentication; SQL Injection; Encryption (source code/sensitive data/entire database/comunications/encrypted backups (new in SQL 2014)); 
Proper use of permissions over database objects (using intermediate layer, execution context, users without login, etc.);
Proxy accounts; alerts for potencial security risks when using clr integration or database cross ownership; Auditing and more...
