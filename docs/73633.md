## Title: Instrument your code – Basic TSQL Logging
## Abstract:
### Well-instrumented code not only helps others with troubleshooting our code but it also helps with performance analysis and provides a good audit of runs over time. In this session we will explore a small framework for TSQL Logging that is easy to use and generic enough to fit simple and advanced use-cases. We will see how we can track messages, errors  duration of runs by code type without intruding on the functionality of common/shared code and how this functionality may be shared across databases with a single code base. Tying DMV’s to business logic side of what is in-flight, is covered. All of the code will be available for use in your own projects. Let us see how you can get your code instrumented on
Day 1!
