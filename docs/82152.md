## Title: The joy of analytics - Let's paint a Data Warehouse into the cloud [EN]
## Abstract:
### There are a lot of possibilities get insights out of your data, and since years we are doing this with "old-fashioned" techniques in our "classical" data warehouse environments. But the world is changing, and so its data.
Where the data years ago was always structured, the growth of different data types now seems to be infinite. We are struggling with saving data with changing schemas and getting insights of new data types like social media, video, and pictures.

In this whiteboard session, I would like to talk with you about modern ways to store, analyze and visualize data. We will draw a Modern Data Warehouse and have a look at the ways to get more insights out of your data and why the cloud could help us.

Come and join my session and draw a Modern Data Warehouse together.
