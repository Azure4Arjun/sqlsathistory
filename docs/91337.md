## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Managed Instances
## Abstract:
### Azure Managed Instances are one of the newest SQL Server related PAAS offering from Microsoft (Azure SQL Managed Instance GA in September 2018). It can be considered a hybrid of Azure SQL Database and on-premises SQL Server with all the great benefits of Platform as a Service.

In this session we will explore:

What exactly are Azure Managed Instances
The differences between Azure SQL Database, Managed Instances, and SQL Server on an Azure VM
What's good and what could be improved.

We'll investigate:
1. When to consider this option
2. How to "lift and shift" our "production" instances.
3.What Service level to consider and the possible costs.

We will also discuss some of the future directions, in particular the new Hyperscale service tier
