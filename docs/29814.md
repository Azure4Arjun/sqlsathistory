## Title: Data Warehousing Best Practices
## Abstract:
### This session will describe the best practises for designing a data warehouse to get the most out of SQL Server.  Doug has worked in data warehousing for 12 years and will blend experience, with best practises and recommendations from Microsoft's Fast Track program.  Each version of SQL Server introduces new features specifically for data warehousing - by applying the correct technique, feature, hint, modelling approach and layout the data warehouse will be faster and more scalable.
