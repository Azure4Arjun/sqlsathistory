## Title: Back Up and Restore? Piece of Cake!
## Abstract:
### Backup and Restore? Piece of Cake!? Right? Backing up our databases is key to protecting our environment. Do you know your backup schedules, backup location and what is required
from the business if a recovery is required? Essentially your RTO and RPO? It is too late to late to identify these items when you receive the call to start a database recovery. During this webinar I am going to share my thoughts, what I document, and concepts around backup and recovery procedures for you databases. So when you receive that call to recover a database you can say “Piece of Cake”.
