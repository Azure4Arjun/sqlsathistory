## Title: Women in Tech Panel
## Abstract:
### The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%. Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/)

## Speaker: Marc Beacom
## Title: Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
## Abstract:
### Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.

# Scripting in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#331-Denver-2014)
Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1 - Modeling/ETL
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Scripting in SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services is full of useful and versatile tasks, components, and containers that allow the ETL developer to easily handle most data movement and transformation issues. However, it's not uncommon to run into ETL need that require more flexibility than what is offered in the native tools of SSIS. Fortunately, Integration Services comes with a couple of tools to overcome most any ETL challenge: the Script Task and the Script Component.

In this session, we will explore both the Script Task and Script Component tools within SSIS. We will discuss the reasons why one might need to include scripting as part of an ETL strategy, as well as examining some use cases where scripting is a good fit. We will follow up with several demonstrations of how to solve specific ETL challenges using the Script Task and Script Component in SSIS.

# The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#331-Denver-2014)
Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4 - DB Dev/DBA
## Speaker: Todd Kleinhans
## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset for 3D Gaming and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.

## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!
## Abstract:
### Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

# Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#331-Denver-2014)
Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 6 - DBA 2
## Speaker: Wendy Pastrick
## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
## Abstract:
### Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

## Title: Introduction to Powershell for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### Maybe you've only heard of Powershell.  Maybe you've seen a little bit of Powershell code, but still don't understand how it works.  You've been telling yourself for months now that you need to learn it.  Why wait? The time to get started with Powershell is now.

In this half day session, we will build the foundation for using Powershell as a database administrator.  Three areas will be covered:
 - Powershell fundamentals - How the language works and how to write it
 - Powershell/SQL Server integration - Functionality written specifically for SQL Server
 - Application of Powershell - Use cases and code examples that leverage Powershell for database management

This session is intended for database administrators of all levels who have minimal experience with Powershell.  Attendees who participate in this session will leave with a solid foundation of Powershell and how to apply it in their own environments.

# The Lost Science of Set Theory
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#331-Denver-2014)
Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3 - T-SQL
## Speaker: Aaron Cutshall
## Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory
## Abstract:
### Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.
