## Title: The Haberdashery of Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Haberdasheries are various small goods such as buttons, thread and similar sewing goods. When used together correctly, they provide the basis for making good clothes.
Building good Machine Learning solutions is similar, you'll need various small things in your toolkit that you will then leverage build production ready predictive solutions.

In our little Machine Learning shop, you'll receive tips on collaborative data science, automating data pipelines, automated machine learning and will learn how to apply agile methodologies operationalize your experiments in a fast way. We'll even consider the maintenance of your machine learning models afterwards as that often gets overlooked.
Using Azure and SQL Server Machine Learning Services during our examples, you'll be able to take these tips home and apply them yourself.
