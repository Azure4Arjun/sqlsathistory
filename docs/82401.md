## Title: Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros
## Abstract:
### Finding any IT industry publication that does not frequently reference Hadoop and Big Data is nearly impossible. Even so, to many SQL Server professionals it remains a mystery. 'Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros' bridges the gap between knowledge of SQL Server and Hadoop. The first half of the session describes how Hadoop works by comparing it to what you already know about SQL Server. The second half is a series of demonstrations of Hadoop functionality. If you've ever wondered how Hadoop works and how it may effect you as a data professional, this is the session to attend.
