## Title: Getting Started with PowerShell's Job Infrastructure
## Abstract:
### A key feature of Windows PowerShell is the ability to execute long running tasks in the background while you continue to use the shell for other tasks. In this session you will learn about the PowerShell's job infrastructure including using scheduled background jobs, a new PowerShell 3.0 feature. We'll also explore some alternatives such as using runspaces.
