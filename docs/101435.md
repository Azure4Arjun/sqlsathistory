## Title: Scaling Clustered Column Store Indexes
## Abstract:
### Clustered Column Store Indexes are a great tool when used correctly. This session will explain on how to plan, configure, and operate Clustered Columstore indexes to handle trillions of rows. This is done with a real world example that is in production. Avoiding mistakes in the beginning will save you lots of data wrangling over time. 

Come and learn how to partition, select the right datatypes, and insert the data into a Clustered Column Store Index to achieve optimal performance results.
