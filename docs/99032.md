## Title: Building a proper indexing strategy
## Abstract:
### Indexes play a crucial role in database performance. Proper indexes will significantly reduce query run times and reduce resource consumption. However if we do not take care when creating indexes we can actually hurt performance. To that end it is important to understand what makes for a good index as well as how to properly maintain indexes. In other words we need an indexing strategy.

In this session we will cover the following:

Heaps
Clustered vs non clustered indexes
How the optimizer determines what indexes to use â€“ Statistics!
How to determine good indexes
How to implement proper index maintenance / Common strategies
