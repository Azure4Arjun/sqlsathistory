## Title: An introduction to Query Store
## Abstract:
### Query Store is an exciting new feature in SQL Server 2016. It can automatically capture and store a history of queries, query execution plans and execution statistics that makes troubleshooting performance problems caused by query plan changes much easier.
In this session we will examine Query Store, it's architecture, configuration and how it can be used to solve performance problems.
