## Title: Zerto: Keeping the Enterprise Always On with IT Resilience
## Abstract:
### Grab your lunch and join the Zerto experts in the Zerto (San Francisco) room for an informative presentation while you eat!

Your organization is always running and can't afford downtime during a disaster or the traditional time it takes to recover from one. Backup solutions don't solve these problems as they are not true disaster recovery for the business. What types of disasters will impact the business? Learn about disaster recovery scenarios, and also the questions to ask and answer when planning your disaster recovery solution to drive true IT resilience. Learn about which decisions impact the business in which ways, and how to avoid making sacrifices for your always-on organization.
