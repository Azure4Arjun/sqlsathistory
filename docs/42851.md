## Title: Killing FearOps with a culture of DevOPS
## Abstract:
### FearOps is a fear of change, a fear of manual/automated deploys going anywhere near production systems. 
DevOPs is about breaking down the silos of mistrust between development and operations teams and aligning the two teams around delivering a product to market faster.  It is about a cultural shift as much as a process and technological one. 
In this session we will look at some of the challenges implementing DevOps, the benefits of it, and how it can help you remove FearOps from your organisation.
