## Title: Using M for data access in Analysis Services Tabular v.next
## Abstract:
### The most exciting feature of the next version of Analysis Services Tabular is the ability to use the M language for data loading. In this session you'll learn the basics of M and see how it can be used to connect SSAS to a wide variety of new data sources, transform data before loading, and also how to use it when partitioning a table in your model.
