## Title: Diagnosing and fixing deadlocks in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### You know how locking works in SQL Server, but now you are tasked with diagnosing and fixing deadlocks. How do you take the knowledge you have and apply it to address deadlocks in your production database?

In this session, we will discuss how you can use free tools to detect and analyze deadlocks in your system. We will do a deep dive on deadlock XML with an eye toward interpreting the information automatically collected by SQL Server when the free tools fall short. 

Attendees will leave with the understanding they need to develop solutions to deadlocks in their systems.
