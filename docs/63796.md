## Title: Understanding Power BI Premium
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Power BI has enjoyed a lot of attention and success since it became generally available in July 2015.  But its licensing model and cloud-hosted limitations barred wide adoption, especially with larger organizations. The recently introduced Power BI Premium will change all of this. Join this session to learn how Power BI Premium will allow your organization to achieve:
•	Flexibility to license by capacity
•	Greater scale and performance
•	Extending on-premises reporting with Power BI Report Server
•	Embedded analytics
