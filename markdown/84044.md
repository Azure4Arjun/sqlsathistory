## Title: A Look Inside SQL Server Distribution Statistics
## Abstract:
### Where do the estimated rowcount values come from? We’ll look inside SQL Server’s distribution statistics to see how they are used to come up with the estimates. We’ll explore some of the new metadata that let you see more details about the statistics and the data changes. We’ll see how and when SQL Server’s distribution statistics are updated and what control you have over the updating of statistics.
