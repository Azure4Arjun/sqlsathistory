## Title: Back To Basics; Getting Back To The Basics of SQL 
## Abstract:
### We will be getting back to the basics of Microsoft SQL Server and looking in depth at all of the object types within SQL Server as well as the commands to work with them.

All to often people focus on the advanced high end parts of SQL Server without getting a good grounding in the basics of SQL Server.
