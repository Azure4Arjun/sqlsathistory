## Title: Traveling through the 4th Dimension with T-SQL and PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Time. We are all cursed and blessed with it. We run out of it, often need more of it, sometimes forget it but are always keeping track of it. In this session, we will delve into the functions provided in T-SQL and PowerBI to demonstrate how to solve both simple and complex problems with time and dates for your reports and dashboards. Ever wondered what is so special about 01/01/1900 and what will happen on January 1, 10,000? Do you want to know how to find gaps in time between systems or forecast the future? Are you interested to know how to accurately tally hours from minutes (it may not be as easy as you thought), then this session will not be a waste of your time.
