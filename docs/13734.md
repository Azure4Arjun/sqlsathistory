## Title: Integrating Big Data with SharePoint 2013
## Abstract:
### Are you currently working with Big Data? Do you wish it were easy to share that information with key stakeholders in your organization? In this demo-driven session, you will learn how to take the analysis you've done and share it with the entire organization via SharePoint 2013. 

We will look at surfacing Big Data via Excel with PowerView and eventually publishing it in a SharePoint 2013 farm. We will also look at the security and performance implications of integrating Big Data with SharePoint 2013, so you will be able to properly design your Business Intelligence infrastructure.
