## Title: SQL vs NoSQL: a Comparison of SQL vs MongoDB
## Abstract:
### Have you heard of NoSQL, but aren't really sure what it is? Are you wondering if you're missing out on something that could satisfy that complex data model problem you haven't found a good solution for?

We'll learn about the flavors of NoSql and then dig down into MongoDB, the NoSQL database that drives many websites. Then we'll get an overview of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) along with how and why it's used in NoSQL, focusing on its advantages and disadvantages.

You'll see how the SQL table structure compares to the NoSQL data structure. After that, we'll look at examples of storing the same data in both systems and how that data flows to the web page.

We'll discuss the factors that drive your choice of database along with the trade-offs involved. Then we'll wrap up by taking a look at Microsoft's on-premises and cloud efforts in the MongoDB NoSQL space.
