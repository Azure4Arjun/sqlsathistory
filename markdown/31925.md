## Title: Easily Manage your Servers with CMS and PMB
## Abstract:
### In this session, you will learn how to setup and implement Central Management Server (CMS) to run queries against multiple SQL servers in your environment. We will also cover Policy Based Management (PBM) and how to use out of the box best practices and create custom policies to maintain your environment. We will then look at using both CMS and PBM in conjunction with each other to monitor your environment.
