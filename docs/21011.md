## Title: Introduction to PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### Building an SSAS cube isn't for everyone. PowerPivot is! This session is for anyone who wants to get started in PowerPivot. Join us as we build a PowerPivot model from the ground up and then create some reports, all in just over an hour. Learn how to use data from existing sources, such as SQL Server databases or Analysis Services, as well as how to integrate currently unrelated data from sources such as Excel workbooks.
