## Title: Data Warehouse Automation - End-2-End in 20 min by TimeXtender
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will demonstrate the power of Discovery HubÂ® by building an end-to-end solution from scratch in just 20min. We automate the majority of the tedious tasks related to a DWH project with high quality auto-generated scripts, documentation, data lineage tracing managed deployment/execution and many other value-adding features. This accelerates your BI projects dramatically and on a single platform on top of SQL Server technology.
As our platform is Microsoft Azure certified, we effectively support Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Database and managed instances among others. Additionally, we demonstrate the ease of taking structured data and seamlessly integrating it with data visualization tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Qlik or others.

The session will include steps like:
- Connect to a data source
- Build an Operational Data Exchange
- Stage data with examples of common ETL tasks
- Create a Modern Data Warehouse
- Create a Semantic Model
- Visualize data in Power
