## Title: Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is everywhere, and that includes SQL Server. In this session we'll look at using PowerShell with both the SQL Server provider and the SMO (SQL Management Objects) library. Learn how to handle common DBA tasks, such as checking the status of various services, validating backups, and checking for disk usage. You'll also see how to perform developer tasks such as creating tables, inserting records, and querying data. Perhaps most importantly, you will learn how to read and understand the SMO object model, and translate it into PowerShell commands. Come see how to become a hero with SQL Server and PowerShell.
