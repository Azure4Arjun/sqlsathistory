## Title: Getting Started with Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### AzureSQL Database has gone from being a simple PaaS relational database to a more complex service with different service options. Selecting the right service option and tier for your need can be difficult.

In this session I will explain the differences between SQL Database, Managed Instance, and Serverless as well as the Hyperscale options. Together we will look at the use casses where these will fit best and when you should not use them in order to deliver the best results for your data driven applications.
