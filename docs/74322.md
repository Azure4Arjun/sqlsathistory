## Title: Transforming Your Brain with SQL 2017 with Linux
## Abstract:
### By now, most of us heard of SQL on Linux when it was first released.  It was also on the announcement of  SQL 2017 which caught most of us by surprise, being that SQL 2016 was just released 16 months prior.  Most of us were still using SQL 2008 and barely getting our organizations to adopt SQL 2012.  The IT infrastructure we serve today probably wouldn't benefit from Linux since most of our servers are tightly woven with the Microsoft platform solution.  So why bother learning SQL 2017 on Linux?  Attend this session to find valuable lessons for every data professional should know whether Linux or Windows.
