## Speaker: Hubert Kobierzewski
## Title: (PL) SQL Server talks Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Nowadays (or in near future), when building data warehousing solutions we have to reach data saved on Hadoop nodes. With SQL Server 2016 you can do that leaving Hive, Pig and other animals behind and focus on your current skills. This session, fully packed with demos, will be focused mainly on new SSIS components keeping conversation with our Hadoop servers. I promise, your BI developer life will be easier from now on.
