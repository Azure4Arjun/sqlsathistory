## Speaker: Greg Moore
## Title: Who's flying the plane?
## Abstract:
### Every company will eventually have a disaster. It's just a matter of size and scope. This talk is a general overview of how to respond to an incident and talks about the roles of management and IT. 

This is not your typical discussion of disasters focusing on how to make a backup plan or enable high availability.

I'll touch upon what we can learn from plane crashes and from rescuing stuck or injured cavers.  
We'll learn acronyms like CRM and ICS and what they can mean to your organization.
