## Title: Let's build an end-to-end IoT solution - from Edge to Cloud
## Abstract:
### Building an IoT solution from scratch can be difficult and might require a lot of development effort. Using the building blocks of Microsoft's Azure IoT and Data services things get much easier. The Azure IoT Solution Accelerators let you build your IoT solution in a few hours instead of days and weeks.

This demo-heavy session is for the cast and crew of developers that make any IoT solution work for its intended audience. It's a guide not just to the “Things”, but to their secure connection to the “Internet” that powers every IoT solution and the analytics that allows you to gain insight from your data.
