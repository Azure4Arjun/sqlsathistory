## Title: T-SQL Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### Experience with a platform gives us patterns:  common techniques which we can use to solve a number of recurring problems.  They also give us anti-patterns:  common techniques we often use to solve a number of recurring problems incorrectly.  This session will cover a number of anti-patterns related to writing T-SQL code.  We will cover each anti-pattern in detail, explaining the problem, why you might reach for the anti-pattern, and better alternatives which won't leave you hurting for performance.
