## Title: DAX Formulas: Evaluation Context
## Abstract:
### Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is an expression language used to develop calculations based on PowerPivot data. A lot of its capabilities are very intuitive to Excel power users as it emulates current functionality but over a much larger set of data.  However, Its real power emerges with the ability to create aggregations that are evaluated at different contexts on the data stored in-memory. This session will explore DAX formula context, which is of great benefit when developing business calculations like ratios or weighted averages.  A brief comparison with MDX will be established in order to contrast the process followed by each language when establishing the context of a calculation.
