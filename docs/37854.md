## Speaker: Shannon Duplessis
## Title: Managing Customer Expectations - Are you winning or losing?
## Abstract:
### Excellent customer service and high customer satisfaction must start with understanding customer expectations. Whether your customers are internal (i.e., HR, Finance, Marketing business users) or external, you need to know who your customers are and what their goals are before launching any business initiative. If not, youâ€™ll never win. 
Pulling from her industry experience in Government, Legal, Education and Healthcare, Strategic Engagement Manager Shannon Duplessis will use the Sparkhound Assessment Model (SAM) approach to show how to assess client needs, agree upon desired expectations and results, and then develop the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure success.
