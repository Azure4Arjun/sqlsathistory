## Title: Working with the Azure Data Lake for modern BI architecture
## Abstract:
### I will describe the basics of the Azure Data Lake and how it's been put to use with other Azure services in the Cortana Intelligence Suite. This will cover Data Lake Store, Data Lake Analytics, SQL Warehouse, Data Factory, Excel and PowerBI and how these services fit in a modern BI architecture.
