## Title: Proactively Identifying and Dealing with SQL Server Database Corruption
## Abstract:
### Corruption occurs on every SQL Server database whether we like it or not. And the only way to minimize downtime and data loss when it occurs is to proactively identify and deal with database corruption.

In this session, we will learn how to identify and detect database corruption. We will look at incorporating these different approaches in proactively identifying corruption in our regular database maintenance routines. We will also look at how to deal with database corruption using restore or repair that is appropriate to your edition of SQL Server.
