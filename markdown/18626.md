## Title: Extending Reporting Services with Custom Code
## Abstract:
### The Reporting Services expression language can be a powerful tool for customizing report data and layout, but often times you will find it is lacking functionality that is easily available in .Net.  While this session is not designed to teach you .Net it will show you some commonly used .Net functions for Reporting Services.  We will also talk about the difference between custom code that is embedded in a report and external assemblies imported into Reporting Services.
