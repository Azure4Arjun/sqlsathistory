# SQLSaturday #733 - Atlanta 2018
Event Date: 19-05-2018 - Session time: 10:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: The DBA Script Thumb (10 year anniversary)
## Abstract:
### Over time and through many different roles I have collected a wide array of T-SQL scripts and techniques that I use many times per week. These vary from basic troubleshooting, to health checks and best practice configuration settings to custom alerting and trending.  In this session, I will walk through several of these scripts and ultimately show how you can automate the delivery of the output into useful reports and visualizations that will wow your boss (or customers) but more importantly, help you find and address potential problems fast and for free.
