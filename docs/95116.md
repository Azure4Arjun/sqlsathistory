## Title: Essential financial calculations in Power BI
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover some of the essential financial calculations that can be performed with DAX, for visualization in Power BI.

Financial calculations in Power BI are useful for individuals and businesses who want to better understand their past and future financial performance, and quickly and easily visualize the results.

I will include practical examples and a take-away Power BI model covering:
- Valuation and return calculations using XNPV and XIRR.
- Personal finance projections.
- Risk calculations using the normal distribution.
- Calculations on portfolios of assets, including correlation calculations and plotting the efficient frontier.
