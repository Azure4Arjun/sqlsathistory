## Title: Automate the Pain Away with Query Store and Automatic Tuning
## Abstract:
### Join John Sterrett, Principal Consultant at Procure SQL LLC to learn how execution plans get invalidated and why data skew could be the root cause of seeing different execution plans for the same query. We will look at the options for forcing a query to use a particular execution plan. Finally, you will learn how this complex problem can be identified and resolved simply using new features in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 called Query Store and Automatic Tuning.
