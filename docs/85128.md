## Title: Dataflows for Power BI
## Abstract:
### Get and overview of Dataflows and how it integrates data lake and ETL technology directly into Power BI to enable anyone with Power Query skills. 

Before diving into details we will go through the architecture and demonstrate the bigger picture for Dataflows in Power BI.

We will go through how you can create, customize and manage data within the Power BI experience in a simpler way. Part of this will also be to go through Common Data Models which contains the business entities across your organisation.

This will help your organisation simplifying modeling and is intended to prevent multiple definition for the same data.
