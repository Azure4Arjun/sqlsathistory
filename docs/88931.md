## Title: Use Case for SQL Server Service Broker: Historization of customer data
## Abstract:
### SB is a hidden gem in Microsoft SQL Server that has received far too little attention. This session describes a business case that requires that data from inactive customers be automatically written to another database. For the customer, synchronous processing is not possible in his OLTP system because a synchronous process puts too much pressure on the ordering system.
With the help of SB, this process can be implemented quickly, safely and stably.
In the session, after an introduction to the technology and operation of Service Broker, the business case with all requirements will be cataloged and then a solution will be developed with the help of Service Broker.
Once the process has been broken down into its individual steps, the various processes are implemented using Service Broker.
