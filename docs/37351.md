## Title: Connected at the hip for MS BI: SharePoint and SQL
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has always been the foundation of the Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) story. However, SharePoint has quickly moved into being the presentation layer for this important data. In this session, you will learn the many different options for combining SharePoint and SQL, the location of all the different pieces, how these pieces communicate, some licensing hints, and how Kerberos helps tie it all together.
