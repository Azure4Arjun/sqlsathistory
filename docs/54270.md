## Title: Building a Lambda Architecture using Azure Warehouse and Stream A
## Abstract:
### Itâ€™s been a while since Nathan Marz wrote the first Lambda Architecture post and a lot has happened since. 

The principals described in this approach have been applied and refined, especially within the Hadoop ecosystem. However in this talk we will look at using some of the Microsoft Azure based technologies, specifically Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Data Warehouse to implement this approach to data management and realize some of this benefits of this architecture.
