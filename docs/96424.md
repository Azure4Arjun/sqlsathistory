## Title: Hands-On Query Tuning Workshop
## Abstract:
### You know query plans can help you fix T-SQL performance issues, but maybe you aren’t sure of all the ways query plans can help.  Maybe you use index suggestions, but you wonder if you could do better.  Maybe you’ve never used a query plan at all.  Come to this workshop and learn!

Let’s roll up our sleeves and dig into some T-SQL performance work.  We’ll work together to examine query plans and enhance query performance.  Feel encouraged to take part in the conversation, no matter your experience level.  We’re all here to learn!

You’ll get even more out of the session if you bring a device that can use OpenVPN (if you have SQL Server Management Studio or another client) or remote desktop (if you don’t).  You can then experiment on your own to discover suggestions for the group and see improvements for yourself.

When you leave the session, you’ll have more practical ways to fix slow T-SQL the next time you run into a real-world performance problem.
