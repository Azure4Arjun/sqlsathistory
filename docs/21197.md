## Speaker: Murilo Miranda
## Title: Super Hybrid 2014
## Abstract:
### Most SQL Servers run on-premises. This one runs on the Cloud (too).
More and more, Microsoft is betting in the Cloud and hybrid environments are already a reality. 
We already have few different options to integrate on-premises with cloud environments, which opens a new horizon of possibilities.
On this session, we will explore the available options and understand how could we take advantage of this option, as well as show some action - with some demos.
