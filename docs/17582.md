## Title: Shade Tree Mechanic's Guide to SSAS
## Abstract:
### This is a session for DBAs and Developers working with SSAS who are not sure what happens under the hood when it is queried, or how to tell if it's performing at its best. This is not a session on query optimization. Rather, this session will help you better understand if you should focus on query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed performance boost. We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance.
