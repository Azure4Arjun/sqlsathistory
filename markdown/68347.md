## Title: I'm It - Survival Techniques for the Lone DBA
## Abstract:
### Are you the only database person at your company? Are you both the DBA and the Developer? Being the only data professional in an environment can seem overwhelming, daunting, and darn near impossible sometimes. However, it can also be extremely rewarding and empowering.  This session will cover how you can keep your sanity, get stuff done, and still love your job. We'll cover how I have survived and thrived being a Lone DBA for 15 years and how you can too.  When you finish this session, you'll know what you can do to make your job easier, where to find help, and how to still be able to advance and enrich your career.
