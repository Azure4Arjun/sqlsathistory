## Title: Why Did My Execution Plan Change? Introduction to Query Store
## Abstract:
### Join John Sterrett, Principal Consultant at Procure SQL LLC to learn how execution plans get invalidated and why data skew could be the root cause to seeing different execution plans for the same query. We will look at the options for forcing a query to use a particular execution plan. Finally, you will learn how this complex problem can be identified and resolved simply using a new feature in SQL Server 2016 called Query Store.
