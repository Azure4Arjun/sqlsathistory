## Title: Navigating Today's Azure SQL Services
## Abstract:
### Five years ago there was a limited number of ways to deploy and use the SQL Server engine in the Azure Cloud. Today, there are many different services that one can choose.

How do you determine which service to use?

In this presentation we focus on key attributes of your data to pick the correct service. Certain services have limits on size, performance and movability of database. Other factors, such as the budget of your project, may also come into the decision making.

Transferring a database to the cloud is usually the easiest part of the project. Scheduling batch processes, executing maintenance jobs and providing alerts is usually part of the DBA equation. For companies that have a large amount of ETL packages, a lift and shift of this code might be a consideration. Other companies are more security conscious which means auditing, compliance, and threat detection are key factors in the decision.

At the end of the presentation, the attendee will have a broad knowledge of the Azure SQL services and when to apply each to a given project.
