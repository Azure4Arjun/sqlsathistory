## Title: Deep dive into Query Store on SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Query Store is a new feature that got released on SQL Server 2016 version and is being improved over the last cumulative updates and on SQL Server 2017 vNext CTP's versions. It's a very useful and interesting feature that allow DBA's ( and non-DBA's :) ) to easily identify performance issues on queries and also allow us to fix it in a fast and simple way. Just the ability to compare a previous execution plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. I want with this session to give you the insight and knowledge to get started using this new and wonderful feature that will change the way how you do performance tuning.
