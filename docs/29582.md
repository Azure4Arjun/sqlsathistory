## Title: Energizing the Next Generation
## Abstract:
### The number of young women entering IT is declining. What can those of us in the industry do to encourage and inspire young women to seek out careers in technology? Mentoring programs, field trips and "Bring Your Daughters to Work" days all exist, but what more could we be doing to spark interest? Join us to hear from a panel of technical women talk about organized programs and individual endeavors designed to inspire the next generation of Women in Technology.
