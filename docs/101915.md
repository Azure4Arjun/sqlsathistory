## Title: Azure Data Explorer: Bringing Visibility to the Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Is your data lake a bit more like a swamp? Are your business analysts nearly drowning when you throw them into the deep end of the lake? 
In this session, you'll see how to use Azure Data Explorer to create a more structured interface on the files in your data lake, so that your business analysts can consume it much more easily from tools like Power BI. 
Azure Data Explorer (ADX) is a service that adds a query engine to various types of data, including raw files in a data lake. We'll look at the two ways you can add some structure and visibility to your data lake files using ADX, to eliminate the need for your data consumers to know the location and type of files in the data lake, and to add context such as entity names and data types. With a very small amount of simple code, you can add this structure to your data lake files and let the business analysts focus on the data. 
This session uses Azure Data Explorer and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS gen2) as well as a bit of Power BI.
