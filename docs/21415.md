## Title: NoSQL on Azure: An Introduction to DocumentDB
## Abstract:
### NoSQL data stores have gone mainstream. In this session, we will survey the expanding NoSQL landscape on Azure, providing a big-picture view of these technologies. Also spend a bit more time on DocumentDB, Microsoft’s document database-as-a-service, and Azure Search. This session is aimed at anybody who’s new to NoSQL or is curious about the NoSQL options that Azure provides today.
