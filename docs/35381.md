## Speaker: Roger Doherty
## Title: Monitoring Massive Scale Web Applications
## Abstract:
### Hear how the Media  Advertising Platform Initiatives team at Microsoft used technology and a key hosting partner to monitor the health of the largest online video event in history, the 2008 Summer Olympic Games on NBCOlympics.com. Learn how we used dynamic instrumentation in Silverlight 2 to monitor application and video quality health information for 400,000 simultaneous users, how we leveraged a hosting partner to rapidly deploy and manage an episodic data center, and how we built the data collection and analysis components using Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008, .NET Framework 3.5, and SQL Server 2008.
