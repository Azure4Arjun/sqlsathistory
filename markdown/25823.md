## Title: Automating Database Restores and Verification with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### SQL Server makes it simple to automate backups with jobs and maintenance, but doesn't provide a simple method to schedule test restores to prove the backups have worked. Using PowerShell we can write simple scripts that allow us to automate test restores from our SQL backups, and then check that the restored database is valid, consistent and usable. 

This session will introduce you to the basics of restoring simple databases with PowerShell scripts, and then extending this to cope with more complex situations including data file relocation, point in time restores and running DBCC checks against the restored database
