## Title: Consumption Based Architecture and MSBI
## Abstract:
### As the tools available for BI and data warehousing continue to improve, it should change the way we ultimately deliver BI solutions. Microsoft#39;s BI solutions help us keep data closer to the source. As data and BI architects, we need to design solutions that can support this model. Consumption Based Architecture is one such architecture. The goal of this architecture is to plan and design solutions that minimize ongoing maintenance and enable users quicker and more complete access to data. Some highlights are how tabular models and PowerPivot support this process and where does MDM for BI fit in. Ready to discuss the quot;death of enterprise data warehousesquot;? Join the conversation in this session.
