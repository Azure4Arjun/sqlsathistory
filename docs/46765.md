## Speaker: Jeff Prom
## Title: Mastering Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### As your organization grows, one challenge will be the management of data between systems and organizational units. With MDS, Microsoft provides the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data. This data can then be used within applications, other databases, and ETL processes. By leveraging data stewards to help manage the data repository, you can ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.
