# Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#841---Dallas-2019)
Event Date: 01-06-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Execution Plans for Performance Tuning SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### Performance Tuning starts with looking at a plan SQL Server internally uses to execute T-SQL. There are many parts to the plan as well as additional options for performance tuning.  This session will provide real-world examples of T-SQL that can cause execution plans to not be optimal.  The plan might also expose additions in the form of new indexes that can be added to improve performance. 
There are many paths to reading these plans that need to be discussed and probably you will hear 'it depends' in this session. Explanations of why it depends will be used with examples.

# I/O Tuning 101
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#841---Dallas-2019)
Event Date: 01-06-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: I/O Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Abstract:
### The job of a data professional is evolving rapidly, driving many of us to platforms and technologies that were not on our radar screen a few months ago. I am certainly no exception to that trend. Most of us aren't just monitoring backups and tuning queries - we are collaborating with teams throughout the company to provide them data and insights that drive decisions. Cloud providers are democratizing technologies and techniques that were complicated and proprietary just a few months ago. This presentation walks you through how a silly idea from a football podcast got me thinking about how Azure Logic Apps, the Cognitive Services API, Azure SQL DB, and Power BI combine to provide potentially powerful insights to any company with a social media and sales presence. Join me as I walk you through building a solution that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours too!

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: A Map To Success:  Functional Programming For Database Developers
## Abstract:
### Over the past several years, we have seen a resurgence of interest in functional programming languages, particularly with the success of Scala and R in the marketplace.  Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java.  This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding  functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.

In this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#.  We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language.  We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries.
