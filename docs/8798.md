## Title: “SQL Attack…ed” – SQL Server under attack.
## Abstract:
### Although SQL Server is considered "secure by default", one of the most often successfully attacked targets is the data that resides in a SQL Server. Most of the exploited weaknesses are due to misconfiguration or weak coding practices. In this purely demo-based security session, I will show several real life attack scenarios on different layers. Due to special request this includes some special SQL Injection types. Furthermore I show how an elevation of privileges attack is possible due to a not uncommon configuration as well as an “insider-exploit” with a database root kit.
 – Note: there will be no instructions on how to attack a system, but rather highlight common weaknesses. – (almost) no slides: Demos Demos Demos
