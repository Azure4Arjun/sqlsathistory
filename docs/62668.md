## Title: Extending Applications Securely Using Service Broker
## Abstract:
### If you’ve ever tried to build a distributed application - one that spans multiple servers or even multiple sites - you know how complex it can be. Web services are a common approach to that problem, but they aren’t the right solution to every problem. SQL Server professionals have another option. Service Broker is designed to run in a distributed architecture, and it has strong built-in security to protect the data as it is being transferred between systems. As an added bonus, Service Broker can also be extended to interact directly with a Windows service, providing a bridge to web services or even Azure. I’ll demonstrate how to implement all of these advanced configurations using concrete, real-world examples in this session.
