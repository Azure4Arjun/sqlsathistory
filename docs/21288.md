## Abstract:
###  Understanding when and how to use NoSQL is already becoming critical for all database professionals currently focusing only on the RDBMS world.

We'll also explore the several NoSQL Data Models available in the market today (Key-Value, Column-Family, Document, and Graph) along with explaining the current solutions implementing them (Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, etc..).
