## Abstract:
### Microsoft's modern data warehouse strategy is centered around their latest generation of Azure Data Lake - it is the hub for Azure Synapse Analytics and more.

We will discuss a number of topics including: what is new with gen 2, how is ADLSg2 different than standard Azure Storage, how is security applied and managed, what APIs and SDKs are available, how does it fit into the larger picture, and what is the current state and where is it going. The session will also provide tips and tricks to help you get started and be more successful.
