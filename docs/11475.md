## Title: DAXMD: SSAS Multidimensional meets DAX and Power View
## Abstract:
### This session looks at the most significant new functionality to be added to SSAS Multidimensional in recent years: support for the DAX language and Power View. It will show how Multidimensional models are mapped to Tabular concepts, what works and what doesn't work in DAX, how Power View works with Multidimensional models and what other benefits there are to using DAX with a Multidimensional model.
