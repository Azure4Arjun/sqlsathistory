## Title: Query tuning with Hypothetical Indexes - IT
## Abstract:
### The query tuning activity very often implies the evaluation of the impact of one or more new indexes on the query plan.
The creation of a new index on a large table, as we will see, could require a long time to complete, could take locks for the entire process and occupy a lot of disk space.
In several situations hypothetical indexes can help, although, in order to create and use them, we have to rely on a couple of undocumented features.
In this session we are going to give all the known details of these features and apply them in examples and practical situations.
