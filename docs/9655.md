## Title: Mobile BI with SSRS and SharePoint
## Abstract:
### Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive. Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors? Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and other mobile devices, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.
