## Title: Who Am I? Identity Management in Azure
## Abstract:
### When moving to a cloud or hybrid environment, one of the biggest challenges is maintaining a consistent login experience for users. Many firms have challenges with connecting Office 365 to their Azure infrastructure, particular in more complex designs.  A bad design can raise security concerns or give users a bad experience. In this session you will learn about how Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, and Active Directory Federation Services work together to offer your users a single common logon experience. You will learn about the proper architecture for your security needs and scale.
