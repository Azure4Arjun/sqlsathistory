## Title: 5 ways to track Database Schema changes
## Abstract:
### In the perfect world, only Database Administrators have access to SQL Server databases. All database schema changes go through strict Change Management Process where they need to be well described and approved by Change Advisory Board. The database schema is stored in a source code repository and deployed version doesn't drift unexpectedly from its original model.

Unfortunately, we don't live in the perfect world.

Sometimes database schema is changed without our knowledge and supervision. Sooner or later such unexpected schema changes start to be very problematic. They may break some functionality or create some performance issues.

In such a case, various questions arise and you as a DBA will have to answer them.
•	What has been changed?
•	When it has been changed?
•	By who it has been changed?

In this session, I will demonstrate you 5 different ways to track database schema changes. Thanks to this, you always will be able to easily answer such questions.
