# Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-232)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Powershell
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

# “Indexing” Encrypted Data
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-232)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

# Into the Wild,Taming Unstructured Data
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-232)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI  Big Data
## Speaker: Christopher Price
## Title: Into the Wild,Taming Unstructured Data
## Abstract:
### There is runaway growth in the data volumes many organizations are facing today. The bad news is that much of this data is unstructured which means your traditional RDBMS just isn't capability of helping you deal with it. As a result significant emphasis has been put on technologies like Hadoop, No SQL and other distributed databases which are better suited to handling unstructured data. With the latest release SQL Server 2012 however, Microsoft has provided new features which will help tame some of this unstructured data. This session will dive into the new FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search features. We will show you how they work and highlight real world examples for integrating these exciting new features into your organization.

Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2
## Speaker: Daniel Taylor
## Title: Will SQL Server Standard edition meet your needs?
## Abstract:
### Working in large Enterprise environments as an employee is a challenge on the best of days. Getting the company to purchase the proper software is I believe a difficult task for even the most seasoned DBAs. Having started at my 3rd large Enterprise I have come to learn that each one manages the purse strings in their own manner. I have always been graced with corporate licenses that allowed me to install Enterprise Editions of SQL Server across the board. I am happy to say that the pendulum has swung and I am now tasked with justifying my SQL Server licenses. This has been a positive event for me that I would like to share with you. This session will share with you some of my current experiences with Standard and Enterprise Editions of SQL Server.  You will be armed with some facts that can help you decide Standard or Enterprise edition so that you can meet the projects objectives, your SLAs and most importantly justify the cost of your SQL Server license.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
## Abstract:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

# Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-232)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Prof Dev/Cloud/Misc
## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis
## Abstract:
### This session introduces Data Quality Services, a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from more than one source you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL 2012 answers this need with Data Quality Services (DQS). In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data. You will see how to build a domain both manually and from an existing data table. You will then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel preparing them for use in SSAS and PowerPivot. After this session, you will understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.

# What the VLF? 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-232)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2
## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: What the VLF? 
## Abstract:
### Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

## Title: Maximizing SSIS Package Performance
## Abstract:
### So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.

# DAX for T-SQL folks

Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI  Big Data
## Speaker: Anthony Sammartino
## Title: DAX for T-SQL folks
## Abstract:
### A lot of report development today is done through T-SQL using a lot of temp tables and aggregate functions. The reason for this is because a lot of database developers were scared of Analysis Services MDX and its complexity. Until SQL Server 2012 there was no other option in the Microsoft stack for a corporate BI solution until SQL Server 2012 and the BISM Tabular Model. BISM Tabular's query language is an Excel like language called Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This session will cover some basic concepts of the DAX language and how powerful it is and why the T-SQL developer should consider it.
