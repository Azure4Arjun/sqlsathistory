## Title: Creating a C# Runtime Dynamic SSIS Designer
## Abstract:
### SSIS enables us to quickly create deployable packages to move/manipulate data. Things do however get a bit challenging when source and destination tables are not known at package design time or when a requirement exists to have an already-deployed package support schema changes in source tables. One solution to this problem is to leverage our ability to create and execute an SSIS package dynamically in code.

In this session we will take a look at a complete project for a C# Runtime SSIS Package Designer, taking as input a set of table names and dynamically generating both destination Access tables then creating, validating, saving and executing an SSIS Package at runtime with logging enabled to demonstrate the various package steps.
