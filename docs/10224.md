## Title: SMO Internals for High Performance PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Ever wanted to know what happens behind the scenes in SQL Server when you use PowerShell and SMO to manage a SQL Server?  How fast can your automation really go? I will take you through a few common objects in SMO and the internals of what happens when you use those objects. We will examine the TSQL that is generated, and learn techniques that lead to high efficiency.  We will dive deep through the collections that make SMO the powerful tool it is. Combining the flexibility of PowerShell and SMO Internals is a recipe for awesome sauce.  Come peek behing the curtain and squeeze the speed out of your automation scripts using PowerShell and SMO.  You'll be glad you did.
