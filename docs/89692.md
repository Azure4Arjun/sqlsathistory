## Title: Antipattern Assumptions in Data
## Abstract:
### While we are engineers, we are still people full of assumptions, biases and unchecked preconceptions about society and other people.  This impacts our design patterns for software and databases. When we design architecture that is limited based on our assumptions, we can find our products limiting and creating user experience problems.  In this session, we will discuss common antipattern assumptions that cause these limitations in our architecture design.  We will also talk through the importance of creating a diverse team to help broaden perspectives and increase innovation which can help counter these antipatterns to pave the way for higher quality products.
