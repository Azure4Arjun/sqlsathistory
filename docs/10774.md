## Title: Dynamic Partitioning Cubes
## Abstract:
### In every project on Business Intelligence there comes a time when the code needs to be deplyed to the production environment.
No more development, no more manual work.
But what about the partitions on the cube? Do we really need to tell and learn the DBA how to handle that on a periodic plan?
The answer is simple: No!
