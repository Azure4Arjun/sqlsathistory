## Title: SQL Server on Linux, a new frontier
## Abstract:
### At one time, Microsoft SQL Server was only available on the Windows platform.  This expanded to the Azure cloud environment, though still on the Windows platform.  One stronghold of the other RDB vendors remained and it has a significant installed base, Linux.  Well, not just Linux, but "Open Source" systems and those derived from the open source operating systems, OS X included.  
With the release of Microsoft SQL Server for Linux, this last major hurdle in the enterprise is starting to fall.  There is much more product development work needed to catch its older brother, but Microsoft SQL Server for Linux has become interesting and viable for the enterprise and hobbyist.  Join me as we take a look at what is currently available in Microsoft SQL Server for Linux.
