## Speaker: Justin Dearing
## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA Precon
## Abstract:
### This is a half day pre-con for DBAs, database developers, and application developers that want to get started with storing their database schema in git.

We will cover using git from the command line and with Visual Studio. We will be using github as our central repository, but we will discus other cloud and on premisis options for the primary repository.

Our example application will be an ASP.NET MVC application and SQL Database whose schema will be managed by SSDT. Participants will be expected to have a laptop with either the community edition or professional edition of Visual Studio 2013, the latest CTP of SQL Server 2016, git for windows and Tortoise git. A github URL for the example application will be provided in advance. Attendees will be expected to have cloned the repo, compiled the application, and having it run locally.
