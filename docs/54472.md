## Title: Database Restore Testing...Automated
## Abstract:
### How do we know the backup files of our databases are free from corruption?  Why would we care?  The hardware storing the backup files is reliableâ€¦right?  What could possible go wrong?  Right?  The only way to know our database backup files are in good order is to validate them.  How do we do that?  One way is to restore the databases from those backup files and check the integrity of the restored databases.  This session will show some benefits of database restore testing and walk through the code of a SQL Agent job that automates it.
