## Title: Tune Queries By Fixing Bad Parameter Sniffing 
## Abstract:
### Parameter sniffing is a misunderstood issue on SQL Server. Most of the time, parameter sniffing is helping performance on your servers. But sometimes, circumstances change, and what was helping you is now hurting you – bad. In this session, we’ll gain an understanding of what exactly parameter sniffing is and why it’s usually so helpful. Then we’ll explore how parameter sniffing can go wrong and look at seven different ways you can deal with it when it does. You’ll take away a wealth of knowledge that will help you identify and resolve bad parameter sniffing in your own environment.
