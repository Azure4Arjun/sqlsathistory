## Title: Let's learn Greek - Hekaton (EN)
## Abstract:
### Hekaton is the Greek word for 100 - the goal of Hekaton in SQL Server 2014 is to improve query performance up to 100 times. In this session we will look under the cover of Hekaton and the Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) principles on which Hekaton is build. We will start the session by looking on the challenges that can be solved by Hekaton, especially Locking, Blocking, and Latching within SQL Server. Based on that foundation we move into the principles of MVCC, and how a Storage Engine and Transaction Manager can be built based on that concepts.
