## Speaker: Cristian Lefter
## Title: AI in Power BI
## Abstract:
### AI and Power BI? Yes! 
Azure Cognitive Service comes with a set of powerful, pretrained models for intelligent applications. At this point, four of them are exposed in Power BI: language detection, sentiment scoring, key phrase extraction, and image tagging. These models can be used on textual data or images.
During the 60 minutes of the sessions we will find out together the answer to the questions WHAT, HOW and the most important one, WHY.
Fun is guaranteed :)
