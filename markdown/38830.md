## Title: SQL SERVER 2016 PERFORMANCE FEATURES
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover new SQL Server 2016 features, Query Store and Live Query Statistics. Query Store is designed to help with query performance by making it easier to identify poorly performing statements and finding scenarios where performance regresses.
 
We will discuss how Query Store collects and presents historic information and how it can be used to reduce the time it takes to diagnose and resolve issues. If a query generates different plans, you can use Query Store to analyze the plan changes, identify performance degradation, and even force the query processor to use a particular plan for your query. 

Live Query Statistics is a feature added into SQL Management Studio that provides the ability to view the live execution plan of an active query. This live query plan provides real-time insights into  query execution process as the controls flow from one query plan operator to another. These execution statistics are extremely useful for debugging performance issues.
