## Speaker: Merrill Aldrich
## Title: Eureka! Visual deep dive into storage internals
## Abstract:
### Sometimes half the battle in computing is just to see what's happening. We will take a visual tour of physical database storage structures, using live demos with the freeware application SQL Server File Layout Viewer and our old friends the DBCC commands as guides. See what happens in a data file when you convert a table from a heap to a clustered index! See fragmentation and the havoc wrought by Shrink! Marvel at the behavior of multiple files and filegroups! Index Rebuilds! Eureka!
