## Title: SQL Server Storage internals: Looking under the hood.
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what goes on under the hood of your SQL Servers? SQL Server is a complicated system. Understanding how your data is actually stored on disk can have a profound effect on the choices you make while designing and architecting a solution. In this session I'll show you how data is physically stored and how choices you make effect performance. We'll look at the structure of rows and data pages, index allocation maps, and the physical differences between heaps and clustered indexes.
