## Speaker: Dinesh Asanka
## Title: Machine Learning  with SQL Server 2016 R Services
## Abstract:
### Microsoft recently launched SQL Server 2016, which, in addition to many other great features, offers in-database advanced analytics with R Services, allowing users to combine the power of SQL Server and Microsoft R Server (or Open Source R), without data leaving the database.

With SQL Server R Services, users can develop analytic models in a local R IDE and it has it's own template as well for support different industry needs.

# Performance Based Indexing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#562---Malaysia-2016)
Event Date: 10-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Manjot Kaur
## Title: Performance Based Indexing
## Abstract:
### SQL server indexes need to be effective so that data could be manipulated with minimum resource consumption. Having too few indexes will result in scanning full tables and having too many indexes will result in incurring un-necessary costs in keeping the index up-to-date. Even if the number of indexes "seem" sufficient, de-fragmenting is only one side of the story. In this session, we will cover index creation best practices and demo sql cache based index tuning, duplicate indexes, and more.

## Abstract:
### Start gaining the benefits of going to the Cloud for your Business Intelligence needs right now!
In this session we will explore how we can start implementing and using both Azure SQL and Power BI together.
The idea is to develop a demo template that audience can take away and start building their own real-world solution.
Heck, we may even implement some cool Azure SQL features like operational analytic if time permits. ;-)

## Speaker: Dr. J. Joshua Thomas
## Title: Data Analytics: Drill, Hit, Predict and Visualize
## Abstract:
### Data acquisition becomes extremely easier and companies start using huge amount of data to analyse customer behaviours, and to provide customers with more tailored service.  Data analytics is become progressively important in services organisations. Among various data processing approaches machine learning is predominantly imperative. According to user’s interests, automatically predict things that have the same feature to the users is also a crucial part of user personalised service. If sophisticated visual analyses generate immediate results presented in ways that shows patterns and allow exploration people across all levels to make effective decisions. This session will highlight on Microsoft’s Azure, Power BI tools to explore relevant data sources.

# Processing unstructured data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#562---Malaysia-2016)
Event Date: 10-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Dinesh Priyankara
## Title: Processing unstructured data
## Abstract:
### Receiving imperfectly column-aligned data from applications is becoming a norm. However preparing this data for pre-defined relational structures using traditional methods is becoming significantly complex. Many implementations though, still handle this using traditional programming techniques - but isn't this still a database related task? And shouldn't the components of the Database Management Systems bear the responsibility of getting this done? With new features incorporated into modern database platforms, processing unstructured data is no longer a challenge, and can be performed easily. Let us take a sample data set and see how we do this the Microsoft way, of course using Microsoft SQL Server product suite including cloud offerings such as HDInsight.

## Title: Hyperscale technology lets a DBA sleep, +30 minutes a day!
## Abstract:
### Ease of access and easy life is now possible with On-premises and hybrid cloud technology within SQL Server 2016.

SQL 2016 Hyperscale technology gives us a huge relief in Backups, Disaster Recovery solutions, access resources no matter whether they are in on-premises, private or public cloud. New tools within SQL Server 2016 and Microsoft Azure has made every single DBA/Developers life much easier to scale to the cloud. 

This session will enable you to start working on scaling to the cloud and benefit from the SQL Server 2016's advanced new features.

## Speaker: Jason Aw
## Title: Practical Strategies For High Performance SQL Server High Availability
## Abstract:
### High availability doesn't have to mean slow SQL server performance. In this informative webinar, Jason Aw, from SIOS Technology Corp. will share his practical strategies for boosting performance in these IO-intensive environments. He will also discuss the benefits of combining leading high performance storage platforms and high availability solutions to deliver continuous availability and faster application response times in SQL Server environments.

# SQL Server Query Store - The Real "Deal"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#562---Malaysia-2016)
Event Date: 10-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Nagaraj Venkatesan
## Title: SQL Server Query Store - The Real "Deal"
## Abstract:
### "Why my database performance has been suddenly slow? 
 Have my query plans changed? 
 Which plans have regressed and since when? 
 Is there any way I can control the plan change without changing the source code?"

If you have encountered any of the above situations, then query store is your remedy. SQL Server Query store is one of the path breaking features released in SQL Server 2016. The presentation will showcase how query store is a boon in handling sudden performance degradations, plan changes and analyzing query performance patterns over a period of time. Presentation will also demonstrate the power of query store in forcing query plans and compare it against   options available in earlier versions of SQL Server. Presentation will have interesting demos on tracking plan regressions and on scenarios the use force plans feature. At the end of the session, audience will have a clear understanding on how query store becomes their new important weapon in their arsenal, for performance

# Power BI: The shift to business-led self-service analytics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#562---Malaysia-2016)
Event Date: 10-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Gogula Aryalingam
## Title: Power BI: The shift to business-led self-service analytics
## Abstract:
### The recent past has shown us how the business intelligence landscape is shifting away from an IT-led paradigm to a business-led paradigm. This paradigm attempts to put the power of data in the hands of users for self-service. Power BI is Microsoft's self-service business intelligence offering, and is now standing out as a leader in self-service business intelligence. Join this session to learn what Power BI is all about and its capabilities. We'll then move over to various usage scenarios and how Power BI helps save the day. We will also take a look at how Power BI fronts the capabilities of advanced analytics on Azure, and brings it down to the end user.

# Troubleshooting Issues with Extended Events in real time
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#562---Malaysia-2016)
Event Date: 10-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Dharmendra Keshari
## Title: Troubleshooting Issues with Extended Events in real time
## Abstract:
### Extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration specially when you don't have any benchmarking data for troubleshooting issues. In this session, we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time. We will demonstrate how this feature enables new possibilities to capture real time problems without enabling any third party tools or inbuilt SQL Server features to capture issues like blocking,  deadlocks, high CPU and many more.
Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008 but by SQL Server 2016, it has enhanced significantly. After this session, hopefully you will start using extended event, if you haven't started using till now.
