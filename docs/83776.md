# SQLSaturday #800 - Atlanta - BI Edition 2018
Event Date: 22-09-2018 - Session time: 12:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: All (Data) Things Considered: The Lean Coffee Workshop
## Abstract:
### Collaboration is the heart of SQLSaturday's, but too often attendees move from session to session in a passive learning mode.  This session is based on the Lean Coffee model, and is a structured workshop with no pre-planned agenda.  The goal is to involve YOU in the conversation; bring your questions, your answers, your business cards, and your desire to learn.  YOU set the agenda, YOU decide when to move on, and YOU engage and learn.
