## Speaker: Scott Heffron
## Title: Understanding Your Processes Through Operation Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Business processes can get large and complex. So much so, that no one can understand each piece of the puzzle that makes the entire process work. This talk will be on how we put into place ways to capture the events of the processes so that we can more effectively understand and troubleshoot the system. This also allows us to perform further analysis (drilling down into details of the process, time patterns to see trends in how long a certain action takes, root cause analysis, and processing load analysis). This can also help people understand the many steps that can go into a business process.
