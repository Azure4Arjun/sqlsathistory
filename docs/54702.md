## Title: Multi-client SSAS deployment : What's MDS got to do with? [DE]
## Abstract:
### A typical business case: A customer needs an analytical approach for several departments. Some requirements are identical, others differ. How do you design your architecture? Do you prefer building one big solution containing everything or do you build several small solutions, repeatedly building the shared requirements?

In this session we are looking into one possible approach: Build a large solution containing all client views. Maintain the client-specific master data in MDS 2016. The client specific deployment is designed to use AMO based on a client specific configuration.

But how about the Tabular mode? Let's find out together if we can apply a similar approach by using TOM, the AMO extension for tabular model in SQL Server 2016.
