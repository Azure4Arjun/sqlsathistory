## Title: Reading the SQL Server Execution Plan
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll explain what the SQL Execution plan is, how the SQL Server generates it, and how to read the output.  This includes looking at the graphical as well as the XML version of the execution plan.  We'll explore the variety of operators that the execution plan can present you with, and show you how to tell the SQL Server that you want to change the execution plan to get rid of the operators that you don't want to be using any more.
