## Title: Address Quality – What you don’t know can cost you
## Abstract:
### Address data is one of the most common type of contact information found in databases. In this session, we will examine some underlying factors that affect address correctness and build the business case for having good address data. We will touch on how having correct addresses affects all aspects of data quality from matching to enrichment. Handling data is one thing, but knowing your data and understanding the risks are the first step to managing good quality data. Come hear about what you don’t know on Address and Data Quality – it might be costing you.
