## Title: Web Scraping with Python - scraping the web, without the sting
## Abstract:
### Need to download data from a website without an API? Scrape it!
 
Web scraping is a technique for collecting information from websites, especially in ways not intended by the publisher.
 
Many business have web scraping in their data strategy to open up new business opportunities and remain competitive. It is something that we can all use to make existing data acquisition tasks easier and make new goals possible.

Python is well suited to the task of web data acquisition. Thanks to its simple, clean syntax and interactive shell, it is easy and fun to learn. It is accessible to Business Intelligence professionals with an SQL background.

Scrapy provides an infrastructure for writing scraping programs called spiders. It allows you to achieve more with shorter, more declarative code. It can be used for small and large scraping projects.

In our demo we will study the anatomy of a spider, then use it pull data from a website into Microsoft SQL Server for further analysis.
