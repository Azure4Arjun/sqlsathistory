## Speaker: Martin Schoombee
## Title: DW Architecture: More than just Facts  Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Facts and Dimensions are the essence of any Data Warehouse, but there are many other components required to make the environment scalable, flexible and fully automated. 

There are lots of decisions to be made: Should you have a separate database for staging or not? How do you fully automate the ETL sub-system and parameterize it?

In this session we will discuss a practical approach to designing the Data Warehouse back-end, based on personal experience.
