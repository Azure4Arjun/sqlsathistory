## Title: Curious Cases of Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### 	It's been more than two years after the release of the AlwaysOn Availability Groups and every day we see more and more architects implementing this technology. Either on new projects or as a new solution on existing systems, at the design stage everything looks feasible and possible, but sometimes small details may cause a headache during the implementation phase. In this session, we will go through common cases, and others not so common, when implementing Availability Groups in a production environment. Dive with me into these AG cases so when one of these situations pops during your professional life you will already be armed with the knowledge to resolve it!
