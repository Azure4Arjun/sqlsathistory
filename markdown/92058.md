## Title: Data Flow - The Azure version deepdive
## Abstract:
### ETL OR ELT? What actually is the T and if I just want to do something else than CTAS? Just bring me my SSIS Data Flow in modern flavour and I would be happy. Here you have it: Azure Data Factory Data Flow. How it works? What's in it? And is it for any good?
