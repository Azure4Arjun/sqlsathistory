# SQLSaturday #927 - Edinburgh 2020
Event Date: 01-02-2020 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Development
## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: Investigate TempDB like Sherlock Holmes
## Abstract:
### The system database TempDB has often been called a dumping ground, even the public toilet of SQL Server. (There has to be a joke about spills in there somewhere). In this session you will learn to find those criminal activities that are going on deep in the depths of SQL Server that are causing performance issues, not just for one session, but that affects everybody on that instance.
You will learn what you can do to reduce issues by investigating your hardware, your SQL Server configurations, and your coding techniques.
