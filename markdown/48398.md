## Title: A Glimpse of Polyglot Persistence with Azure Data Services offerings
## Abstract:
### Modern cloud applications and services demand for different persistence technologies as they require high volume and diversified data types to be stored. 
Relying on relational data storage is no more feasible, at the same time NoSQL databases do not provide all the great stuff relational databases provide. 
Some solutions overwhelm the usage of NoSQL databases while others have adaptability issues and learning challenges, so finding the right balance between the relational and NoSQL is confusing. 

But the future seems very clear that polygot persistence solutions are the way to design and develop the applications.

This session will help you to understand the fundamentals of the NoSQL offerings of Azure - Table Storage and Document DB and then will give some real world case studies of how polygot persistence could be used along side Azure SQL Databases, which will guide you in making decisions in designing your application.
