## Title: All about Indexes
## Abstract:
### This session will cover everything a good SQL Developer needs to know about indexing.  Will cover how to identify when needed indexes are missing, how to find bad indexes and remove them, understanding exactly what data is stored within indexes and much more.  Understand why having indexes can be both bad and good by understanding your own data and how it is structured and accessed.  Will cover various design patterns, SQL Server DMVs, as well as real world examples of good and bad indexes.
