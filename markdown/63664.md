## Speaker: Nick Burns
## Title: A practical introduction to ML for the Data Professional
## Abstract:
### Ask a statistician, or a data scientist, what it takes to become a serious machine learning (ML) practitioner and you will get a daunting list including in-depth knowledge of mathematics, statistics, machine learning theory and that elusive magic sauce. In this session, we will break down these stereotypes and argue that the essential skills are: a love of data, tenacity and a healthy dose of scepticism.

We will build a prediction pipeline using AzureML and cover the essential elements of the machine learning workflow, from data preparation, prediction, evaluation and communication.
