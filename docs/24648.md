## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Introducing Power BI
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has brought business intelligence to the cloud. What does this mean and how does this work? In this session, we'll review the BI components available in the cloud BI stack. We'll also compare and contrast functionality of the cloud BI tools with on-premises tools. After attending this session, you'll have a better understanding of what's possible and whether it's time to launch your BI-in-the-cloud solution.
