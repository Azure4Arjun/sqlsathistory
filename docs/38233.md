## Title: SQL Server Defaults SUCK!!
## Abstract:
### If you just click next-next-next and think you have a good-to-go SQL Server . . . THINK
AGAIN!! :-) There are umpteen things you just GOTTA change right out of the box if you want your potentially very expensive and always precious SQL Server resource to perform optimally and behave correctly. 

This session will cover a laundry list from BIOS Power Setting to data file growth and many useful items in between sitting everywhere from the physical server to the storage to the VM to Windows to SQL Server to database.
