## Speaker: Ivan Donev
## Title: SQL Server plan cache: The Phantom Menace [EN]
## Abstract:
### Every query you execute in SQL Server must have a plan...a plan, that defines how it is going to be executed. SQL Server Query Optimizer indeed does magic in preparing and reusing those plans, but sometimes we, as developers, need to help it (or at least do not interfere) so the database world is kept in peace. Join me in this advanced session where I will share the simple tricks that can save the day and help you write reusable code, even if you do not use stored procedures in your application.

## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer
## Abstract:
### This is not your regular Agile BIML session. By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets. If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. We will see how to build a reusable C# framework that can be obfuscated and deployed to customers without worrying about Intellectual property. I promise you no more than a few slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration with Team Foundation Server.

## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: Kerberos for BI [EN]
## Abstract:
### Have you ever seen this message quot;Login failed for user ‘NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGONquot; ?
Have you ever witnessed Kerberos mentioned in a conversation - or in a forum - and seen developers shiver, sysadmins crawl back under their rock and project managers fear for the consumed hours ?
Have you ever wondered why it seems so complicated ?
If you answered yes to any of these question then this demo-packed session is for you.
Because Kerberos is something that anyone who must deploy SQL Server wishes they didn’t have to worry about. It truly affects all aspects of SQL Server including the engine, Reporting Services, Analysis Services, SharePoint and PowerPivot. Furthermore we will have a close look at how to diagnose problems and troubleshoot the three-headed beast when it breaks loose.
This session is based on many hours spent sweating in setting up Kerberos in BI and SharePoint environments and explaining support people how to troubleshoot and fix Kerberos issues when they a

## Speaker: Dmitry Pilugin
## Title: Query Store: Taking control of your query performance [EN]
## Abstract:
### Many of us came across a situation when a query suddenly becomes slow. To understand the reason for the slowdown, it would be nice to see what was the query plan before that. Was it the same or another, if it was another, then what had changed? It was a hard to figure it out unless you had implemented your own monitoring system. Fortunately, in SQL Server 2016 we have the solution out of the box, it's called – Query Store.
Query Store is a kind of “flight recorder” for your database, it provides functionality to capture queries, plans and execution statistics in the database, more to the point it allows you to force a particular plan for a query. The session will describe Query Store functionality and capabilities, provide some Query Store internal implementation details and give several usage scenarios.

## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server! [EN]
## Abstract:
### ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.

## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Zombie Attack Against Clustered Indexes - Who really need them! [EN]
## Abstract:
### Clustered Index zombies come out of their graves to make the peace loving Heaps to one of them in your databases. Try to attack them or find a fair way to make them living together in peaceful harmony.

If you ask experts about using a clustered index you will in most cases hear the following statements: Yes, you need a narrow and contiguous clustered index for your table for good performance. Last but not least Microsoft Azure Databases requires clustered indexes but there might be situations when workloads and queries will suffer from wrong implemented clustered indexes.

Watch the demos which show in an impressive way that clustered indexes are not always the best choice. Build your clustered indexes wise or - as the demos will show - forgo for it for a better scaling. Become aware of the pros and cons of Clustered Indexes and make a wise decision when to use clustered indexes and the correct key attributes for it.

## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: SQL Server 2016 and Polybase: Bringing Relational and Non-relational Data Together
## Abstract:
### This demo-heavy session will take a look at PolyBase in SQL Server 2016. This technology provides the means to access and combine both relational and non-relational data all from within SQL Server. Using the wonderful T-SQL language you are already familiar with, you can run queries using T-SQL against data that resides in Hadoop, HDInsight, or Azure blob storage. This session will show how to use T-SQL to import and export data back and forth between relational tables and non-relational data stores. We'll also show how to join and aggregate data from both SQL Server and a non-relational store using T-SQL and how these queries are optimized to push computation down. We'll also look at how to configure and scale out SQL Server PolyBase for those high-volume workloads.

## Speaker: Jakub Müller
## Title: CLR  T-SQL (in real "online gaming" life) [EN]
## Abstract:
### T-SQL has some limitations, which can be partially overcome by using CLR. That extends power of your database in directions you might not be even aware of. Like a bonus you get solid performance, testable and reusable code, similarly maintainable like a regular application code. But everything reliably secured inside of your database.
The potential of CLR capabilites is huge.  I will show top patterns and tip  tricks we encountered during the last couple of years when we we were developing on-line game backend.
