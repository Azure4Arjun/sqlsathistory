## Title: Creating Predictive Models using Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning is a fully managed predictive analytics service that you can use to create predictive models against your data in SQL Data Warehouse, and then publish as ready-to-consume web services.
You will learn how to read data from your database; how  to create, train, and score a predictive model; and how write data to your database or create a web service.
