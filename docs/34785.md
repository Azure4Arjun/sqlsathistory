## Speaker: Michael Fal
## Title: Introduction to Powershell for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### Maybe you've only heard of Powershell.  Maybe you've seen a little bit of Powershell code, but still don't understand how it works.  You've been telling yourself for months now that you need to learn it.  Why wait? The time to get started with Powershell is now.

In this half day session, we will build the foundation for using Powershell as a database administrator.  Three areas will be covered:
 - Powershell fundamentals - How the language works and how to write it
 - Powershell/SQL Server integration - Functionality written specifically for SQL Server
 - Application of Powershell - Use cases and code examples that leverage Powershell for database management

This session is intended for database administrators of all levels who have minimal experience with Powershell.  Attendees who participate in this session will leave with a solid foundation of Powershell and how to apply it in their own environments.
