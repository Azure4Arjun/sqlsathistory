## Speaker: Dr. J. Joshua Thomas
## Title: Visual Analytics and Data Science
## Abstract:
### Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex datasets”. To enable  data analysts to explore large datasets involving varied data types (for example, multivariate, geospatial, textual, temporal, networked), flexible visual analysis tools must provide appropriate controls for specifying the data and views of interest to selectively visualize the data, to filter out unrelated information to focus on relevant items, and to sort information to expose patterns. Data analysts also need to derive new data from the input data, such as normalized values, statistical summaries, and aggregates. This session will highlight on Microsoft’s Power Query, Power Map to explore relevant data sources.
