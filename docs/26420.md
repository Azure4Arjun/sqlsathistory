## Title: SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT
## Abstract:
### The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.
