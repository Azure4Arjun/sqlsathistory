## Title: Introduction to PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### In this session, you’ll learn how to use PowerPivot to create self-service analytics in your organization. You’ll see how Office 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2 will help your users answer their own questions and bring together datasets that may be heterogeneous like a SQL Server table and data feed from a website. Then, you’ll see how to take that data and create a striking report for your end users and collaborate with the data in SharePoint.
