## Title: How to quickly cook a brand new visual for Power BI
## Abstract:
### You have two ways to create a new visual for your great Power BI reports. The first one is to take something called Typescript and code a new stuff. It’s simple and exciting, isn’t it?  The second way is easier and cooler... Use Charticulator! This tool with a strange name gives you everything to prepare your own visual from a scratch without coding, only with dragging and dropping.
