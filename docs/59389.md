## Title: Azure SQL Database for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that Azure SQL Database only supports a small subset of SQL Server functionality, small databases, and has really bad performance. Except, everyone is wrong. In fact, Azure SQL Server Database is ready to support many, if not most, databases within your enterprise. This session reintroduces Azure SQL Database and shows the high degree of functionality and improved performance that is now available. We'll cover topics from monitoring, to high availability to disaster recovery, all within Azure SQL Database. Youâ€™ll leave this session with a more thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Azure SQL Database so that you can make a more informed choice over when, or if, you should use it within your environment.
