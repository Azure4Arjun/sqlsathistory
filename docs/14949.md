## Title: Analysis Services: Choosing between Multidimensional and Tabular
## Abstract:
### Since SQL Server 2012, Analysis Services has two different modeling approaches for data analysis: Multidimensional and Tabular. Despite having the same purpose and very similar features between them, you can actually get a lot of benefits by choosing the model that best fits your project requirements. To help you on this big decision, we will compare their features, modeling experience, server requirements, processing and querying performance, and so on, by using a real scenario.
