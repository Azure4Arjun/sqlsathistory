## Title: Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTE) are a temporary result set used within an SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, that can be used in place of a subquery and can help simplify more complex queries such as when joining to the same result set multiple times.

We'll begin with an overview of how a Common Table Expression is constructed.  Then we'll build some queries using derived tables, and as the queries we build get more unwieldy, demonstrate how the query can be simplified by the use of a CTE.
