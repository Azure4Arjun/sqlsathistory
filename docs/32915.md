## Speaker: Shelly Noll
## Title: How to Thrive (and Survive) as a Woman in IT
## Abstract:
### We often hear about the advantages of diversity in the workforce, but it can be difficult to relate to one another when we all have different backgrounds and experiences. Please join our panelists Kendra Little, Wendy Pastrick, Yanni Robel and Erin Stellato as they explore lessons learned as women working in information technology. They will discuss ways they have been able to leverage their differences to compliment a team and share communication techniques theyâ€™ve acquired from working in diverse environments.  All attendees are welcome.
