## Title: How to outsource yourself with a Powershell script
## Abstract:
### Well, kidding of course. Someone needs to maintain those scripts :-)
But there is a lot of repetitive work that can easily be scripted. 
And powershell is so versatile that it can be used to make scripts that "think" the way a DBA thinks. 
It will solve problems or complete a task for you that includes reacting to various (un)expected circumstances.
I will show you how to use some cool new features of Powershell 3,  like workflows and web access, and I'll use some of my own scripts to demonstrate how this all comes together.
