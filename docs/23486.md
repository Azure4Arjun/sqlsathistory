## Title: Improving our BI solutions with Geolocated data
## Abstract:
### The Business Intelligence capabilities are with us several years. Nowadays,the needs of analysis have changed and the geolocation of data is essential - not only qualitative information. We need to see our data on maps. We need to integrate it with external services to add value to our insights. In this session you will learn to improve our BI solutions with geolocation and take advantage with the SharePoint tools to share and publish this information. Custom DLLs, Excel Apps, Tabular/Multidimensional techniques and the new Power BI capabilities will be shown in different examples using a mapping tool already developed by SolidQ.
