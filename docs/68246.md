## Title: SQL in HDInsight/Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Azure HDInsight lets you spin up an enterprise-class PaaS Hadoop cluster in minutes. But once you have the cluster, what can a SQL Server database professional do with it?  

in this session you will learn all about the the big 3 SQL data access applications found in HDInsight - Hive, Phoenix, and SparkSQL. We'll discuss their respective engines, how they work, and and when you should choose each tool to accomplish your use cases.  Ample demos, scripts, and DDL will be included.
