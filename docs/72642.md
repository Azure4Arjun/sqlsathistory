## Title: DAX More Than Measures: An Introduction to DAX as a Query Language
## Abstract:
### DAX is the native formula language for Power BI and SSAS Tabular. At least, that's how most of us have experienced it.

DAX is actually a query language, with rich semantics to represent all manner of analytical queries. Join us for a deep dive into using DAX to its full potential to answer complex queries using Tabular's in-memory model for lightning speed.
