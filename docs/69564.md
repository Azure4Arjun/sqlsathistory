## Speaker: Eric Strom
## Title: Getting the most out of SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### SSDT has been around for a while, but a lot of people donâ€™t use the tool to its full capabilities.  In this session, we will cover writing unit tests, good deployment script writing practices, T4 and command variables.  This session requires a good understanding of T-SQL and Visual Studios.
