## Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: S.M.A.R.T. Biml: Standardize, Model, Automate, Reuse and Transform
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wanted to build a Data Warehouse simply by pushing a button? It might not be quite that easy yet, but gone are the days of repetitive development. Stop wasting your time on dragging, dropping, connecting, aligning and creating the same SSIS package over and over and over again and start working S.M.A.R.T. with Biml.

You already know how to build a staging environment in an hour, so let us dive straight into some advanced features of Biml. We will start by exploring the metadata modeling feature in Mist. Then we will look at how to create our own C# classes and methods, and how to centralize and reuse code. Finally, we will create a framework of transformers that allow you to modify existing objects both interactively and automatically.

If you already think Biml is powerful, just wait until you have a toolbox full of transformers ready to do the heavy lifting for you!

(No Autobots were harmed in the making of this session.)
