## Title: Interview Tips
## Abstract:
### Have you been asked for an interview for that perfect job? The job that you
would love to have on a team that you really want to be a part of? It is
time to sharpen those interview skills. Every interview is different. During
this session we will talk about my observations from many interviews that I
have been a part of. There are many examples in this session on how not to
present yourself, during an interview. We may laugh at some of the
observations, but there are many lessons to learn. Get an inside look at how
hiring managers make decisions, and make sure you know what to look for as
the candidate. Have you been tasked with conducting an interview? We will
complete the session with some tips on how to make sure that you get the
information you need to make a good decision.
