## Title: MicroORMs:Data Access That Won't Make Your DBA Cry
## Abstract:
### Modern ORMs like NHibernate and Entity Framework are powerful, flexible tools that are the right choice for many projects. But they feel like overkill for that little internal app with three tables and one screen. And even after a ton of tuning, the SQL they produce for that massive screen in your mission-critical enterprise app can be abysmal. It turns out that both of these problems might have the same answer: a Micro ORM. These lightweight tools leverage the power of dynamic typing and other advanced .NET framework features to give you a simple way to get your data that's also easy to optimize. Brian will give an overview of the various tools available, and dive deep into PetaPoco to show you how powerful these little frameworks can be.
