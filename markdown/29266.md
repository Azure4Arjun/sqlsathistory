## Title: SQL Server 2008 R2 Parallel Data Warehouse 
## Abstract:
### We will cover an overview of the functionality of SQL PDW. PDW is a highly scalable appliance for Enterprise data warehousing.  We will discuss how PDW partitions large tables across multiple physical nodes, each having its own dedicated CPU, memory, storage, and each running its own instance of SQL Server in a parallel shared nothing design.
