## Title: Columnstore killed the OLAP-Star?
## Abstract:
### With increasing speed in relational query execution classical analytical solutions get challenged more and more.
Why loose time for processing data into multi-dimensional databases? Why analyze outdated data if you can have fresh data instead?

We are analyzing typical scenarios from classical multi-dimensional analysis like YTD calculation, DistinctCount and others in regards to their efficiency with different solution approaches: Classical multi-dimensional databases in ROLAP mode, DirectQuery, T-SQLâ€¦ And we are going to show how Columnstore indexes are influencing those solutions.

Find out about advantages and disadvantages of the different solutions in regards to the problem. And maybe you will discover new approaches for your own challenges.
