## Title: Data center migration, data centric point of view
## Abstract:
### Data center migrations are all the rage these days and the SQL Server DBA is one of the most important accessories. When an organization decides to change data centers, of all the very important servers that will be migrated, the ones with the company data will be the most watched. Like other projects, a good plan followed by good execution is required. In this session you’ll learn about the research, design, planning, process, and execution to migrate SQL Servers from one DC to another. I’ll go over lessons learned, whether to go it alone or brings in help, discuss pros and cons of migration techniques, big decisions like keeping the same server names, when to and not to virtualize, downtime considerations, data sync, and more.
