## Title: Don't Be Trigger Happy: Safe Use of Triggers
## Abstract:
### Many seasoned DBA's don't want developers to use triggers because of the many common mistakes made when coding triggers that can adversely affect performance.  We will discuss the different types of triggers: DDL and DML (Instead of and after) and see many common mistakes made and how to fix them.  We will also discuss when a trigger may be the best solution and other options when a trigger is not the best solution.
