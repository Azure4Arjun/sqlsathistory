## Title: Cosmic DBA - Cosmos DB for SQL Server Admins and Developers
## Abstract:
### NoSQL is not just about having eventual consistency. Switching from a relational database to a NoSQL data store like Cosmos DB is a mind shift for SQL DBAs and developers used to thinking in terms of tables. Schema-free doesn’t mean you don’t have to think about the schema, but it does allow for faster changes and some interesting design patterns. 

This session will include a quick outline of Cosmos DB. Then it will move on to describe how indexing works, what the consistency levels all mean, and how your JSON should be designed based on your query patterns. And, I will toss in a high-level overview of the JavaScript triggers, stored procedures, and user defined functions for free. All of this will be presented using examples that are informed by my experience trying to convert a global application from SQL Server to Cosmos DB using the document model.
