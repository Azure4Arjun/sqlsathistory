## Title: ADF Data Flows: Build scalable, cloud-based ETL without code
## Abstract:
### - SSIS gave you a graphical user interface for building your Extract, Transform and Load processes hosted in SQL Server
- Azure Data Factory v1 gave you a UI for more scalable Extracting and Loading of data, but the Transformation plug-in was left up to you
- Azure Data Factory v2 gave you more control over how your processes were triggered and the path through your steps (like the Control Flow in SSIS)
- Now coming to ADF is Mapping Data Flows, a UI for building in Transformations into your ETLs, still taking full advantage of scalability in the cloud
