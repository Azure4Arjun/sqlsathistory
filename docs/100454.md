## Title: Retail Point-of-sale scenario using Azure Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### Using managed Azure services such as Cosmos DB can help reduce costs by leveraging Microsoft's expertise in globally distributed cloud-scale data storage and retrieval. 

In this presentation we will demonstrate a scenario which is relevant to organizations that need a  scalable and elastic architecture for online order processing or more specifically e-commerce and retail point-of-sale transactions such as orders, payments and bills. 

This scenario takes an event sourcing approach, using a functional programming model implemented via Azure Cosmos DB change feed processor and additional Azure Services. This approach enables high availability and resiliency, geo-replication, and fast performance.
