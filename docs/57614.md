## Speaker: Patrick LeBlanc
## Title: Zero to Tabular
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Analysis Services can be very intimidating to some people, especially if you have never designed a Semantic model (formally known as a cube).  Join me in this demo-only session where I will show you how to quickly build your first Semantic model in less than 60 minutes.  In addition, I will provide you with some best practices and show you how to enable your end-users to leverage the model to build their own reports using Power BI.
