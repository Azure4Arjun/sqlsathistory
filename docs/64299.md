## Speaker: Peter O'Gorman
## Title: Drone or Die - Defenders of the Universe
## Abstract:
### Since the movie Avatar it seems, the drone has taken the world by storm... a quadcopter of sorts, a flying spider with half the legs... rocketing to the Christmas lists of many households and a very real and palatable career choice, especially here in our very own Queensland.  For the light-hearted, the pure enthusiast, the evil genius or the business savvy, whether you fly a drone or not you may be completely unaware of the role drones play in your daily life.

And drones actually produce a lot of raw data.... With that data comes great opportunity and great responsibility, as we take to the skies with a guided tour of what drone data looks like, and what are the opportunities but what are the responsibilities.... "Up ahead was Pandora. You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I’d be goin’ there...".
