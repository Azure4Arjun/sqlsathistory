## Title: From Access To SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This session is designed to assist the user in migrating from an Access database to SQL Server.  A primer is included that describes the differences between databases, relational databases and relational database management systems (RDBMS).  Additional background is included to acquaint attendees with various aspects of SQL Server that are often missing from formal training classes.  Various reasons are examined for either migrating or not migrating.  Required FrontEnd modifications are discussed as well as some pitfalls that a user may experience.
