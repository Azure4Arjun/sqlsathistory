## Title: Smart SSIS with BIML
## Abstract:
### In this presentation we will show you the power that lies in BIML for SSIS – the power to subtract a significant amount of time from repetitive tasks and add that to tasks that bring real value. Join us for a session where we will show hands-on how to use BIML to generate an SSIS BI framework. This session will be co-presented with João Lopes.
