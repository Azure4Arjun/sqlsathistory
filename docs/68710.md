## Speaker: Rob Kraft
## Title: Security Developers Need To Know
## Abstract:
### In this session I will list the things that developers need to do to minimize the risk that a hacker can gain access to a database.  I will discuss each in depth and provide examples of a good code and practices to keep hackers out.  The list includes: protecting connection strings, using minimal database permissions, funneling all database code through central logging and injection testing filters, proper use of stored procedures, hashing passwords, and SQL injection prevention.  I believe that when developers write a properly architected application, they can be confident that risks of database injection through the application is minimized.
