## Title: Hybrid Solutions with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### By its nature, SQL Server installations on-prem can often require significant CapEx investment on a recurring basis. If you are considering the cloud then you want to ensure that you have received the maximum return from that investment before you switch to a fully OpEx model. Hybrid solutions can let you scale and migrate your SQL Server workloads into Azure while still getting the maximum return from your on-prem infrastructure.
