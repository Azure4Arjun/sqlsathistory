## Speaker: Taras Kloba
## Title: What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes
## Abstract:
### In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tends to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, I will show how to build a deployment pipeline capable of delivering database and application changes. The pipeline includes the following steps: source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will share methods and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the delivery process reducing the delivery pain. 
The main goal is to understand that applications and databases can and should share the same deployment pipeline and that this pipeline will allow you not be afraid of making database changes.
