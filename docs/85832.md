## Title: Power BI Dataset monitoring tool
## Abstract:
### The Power BI Dataset monitoring tool is a “In House” application that can help monitor heterogeneous database environments.  It also helps database administrators (DBAs) and system administrators by notifying potential dataset performance problems. For database server monitoring, Power BI Dataset monitoring tool connects to the database and ensures it is up. Power BI Dataset monitoring tool  is also an agentless monitoring tool that executes Power BI Service API queries to collect refresh status and includes auto-retry features. Using the Power BI reports/visualizations capabilities, DBAs can plan inventory requirements and troubleshoot incidents quickly.
