## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
## Abstract:
### Security by design, it is how we should be building data platforms and applications. Security is not an afterthought that should be tacked on. With Azure SQL DB and SQL Server 2016, this got a lot easier with the new security features that have been added, notably Dynamic Data Masking and Row Level Security.

Here we will explore these two new tools that have been added to our toolbox of SQL Server security. Looking to understand what the features are, and how they work. More importantly, we will look at the use cases for these features. When they are, and are not appropriate. Finally looking at how we can incorporate them into the systems that we are building, and whether we can design them into our existing systems.

Understanding the capabilities that we have available is important, as the threats change so must the technology and our approach. By the end of this session, you will be in a position to decide if these capabilities will help you secure the data you manage.
