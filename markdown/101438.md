## Title: Pattern Recognition: Unlock Data’s Potential using Azure Cognitiv
## Abstract:
### Every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is produced, and 80% of it is unstructured. Go beyond reports and dashboards by leveraging new data sources, infusing AI into your applications, and harnessing cognitive capabilities to streamline every day tasks within your organization.  In this demo-heavy session, we’ll walk through what Azure Cognitive Services are, use cases, and real-world scenarios.  You do not have to be a data scientist to take advantage of AI!
