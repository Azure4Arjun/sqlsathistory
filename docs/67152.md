## Title: Adaptive Query Plans? What’s up with that?
## Abstract:
### One of the new features announced for SQL Server 2017 is Adaptive Query Plans, query plans that can change after the query starts executing.

This session will show why this is a radical departure from the way that things have worked until now and how it can improve the performance of some query forms. We’ll look at the places where adaptive query plans work and compare the performance of queries using adaptive query plans to see just what kind of improvement it can make.
