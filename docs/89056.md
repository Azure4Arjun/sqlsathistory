## Title: Introduction to Dimensional Modeling for the Excel/Power BI Pro
## Abstract:
### As an Excel user, you've probably been building Pivot Tables for yearsâ€¦ but do you know the difference between a Fact and a Dimension? The reality is that PivotTables have done a great job of protecting us from needing to understand proper data modeling, but in modern Excel and Power BI that has changed.
In this session we will look at understanding the benefits of dimensional modeling in Power Pivot. We will define and review key terms and best practices, and show you how to use Power Query to reshape, split and combine tables into their proper tabular formats for a model.
