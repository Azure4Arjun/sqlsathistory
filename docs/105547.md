## Title: Understanding NULLs in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server follows three-valued logic (3VL) (instead of Boolean logic) to evaluate any condition to True or False or Unknown. Unknown value in SQL Server is represented as NULL. NULLs in SQL Server are often misunderstood and causes data inconsistency issues. In this session, we will try to go through different test cases to understand NULLs properly.
