## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Indexes
## Abstract:
### Performance!  Performance!  Performance!  Thatâ€™s what the rocket scientist and SQL Developer are looking for.  Indexes can offer significant performance benefits, but can also be a detriment to overall database performance.  This session will focus on a deep dive into clustered indexes (including B-tree traversal), Primary Keys, and non-clustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering non-clustered indexes will also be examined in detail with emphasis on when and when not to use.  Included will be many live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using statistics and query plans.  Some knowledge of TSQL and Management Studio is recommended.
