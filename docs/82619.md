## Title: Maximizing SQL Server Management Studio for Developers and DBAs
## Abstract:
### Whether you're a developer or a DBA, you likely use SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) a lot.  However, are you using all the features and extensions available to maximize your efficiency?  This talk will show some of the most useful, yet overlooked, features of SSMS and some of the best (and free) extensions to make life easier for you and your teams.  I'll also include some of my most useful code snippets that I've found or written over the years.  Save yourself some time and headaches!

Demos will include the latest version of SSMS and the new SQL 
Operations Studio.
