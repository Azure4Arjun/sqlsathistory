## Speaker: Tom Keller
## Title: Fuzzy-String Searching: UDF and CTE performance
## Abstract:
### How do you find information that was saved misspelled, or when your search is misspelled? Fuzzy-string processing! And if your information is in a database, the best place to do that processing is in the database. But there are some performance lessons to learn along the way. This session graphically illustrates the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm, and explains how it was optimized for T-SQL, using www.fuzzy-string.com and Confio Ignite.
