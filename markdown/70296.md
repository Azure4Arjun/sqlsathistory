## Title: Graphs ... graphs everywhere!
## Abstract:
### Since a few months, graphs are popping up everywhere in the Microsoft Data Platform ecosystem. SQL Server has some new features dedicated to handle and query graphs and Azure CosmosDB has a new API dedicated to query graph structures. This session is the opportunity to be in contact with both technologies and find out their use-cases and limits. We'll start by an introduction to graph then see the concept in action with SQL Server and the new MATCH syntax supported by T-SQL. Then, we'll move to Azure CosmosDB and see why this TinkerPop-enabled database is a good place to handle more complex use-cases and go further with Graphs.
