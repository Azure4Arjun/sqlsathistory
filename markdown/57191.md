## Title: So you installed R, now what? A journey through the Tidyverse
## Abstract:
### By now, all the SQL world should have heard about the R language, especially
since Microsoft is committed to integrate it into their data platform products.

So you installed the R base system and the IDE of your choice. But it's like
buying a new car - nobody is content with the standard. You know there are
packages to get you started with analysis and visualisation, but which ones?

A bundle called The Tidyverse comes in handy, consisting of packages mostly
(co-)authored by Hadley Wickham, one of the brightest minds in the R ecosystem.

We will take a look at the most popular Tidyverse ingredients like ggplot2,
dplyr and readr, and we'll have lots of code demos on real world examples.
