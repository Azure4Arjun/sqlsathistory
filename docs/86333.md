## Title: SQL Server Development on Your Platform Of Choice with Containers
## Abstract:
### SQL 2017's built in support for Docker containers enables new development capabilities without requiring a Windows OS. In this session you'll learn about why you should care about containers (even if you are running Windows), what you can - and can't - do with containers, the basics of how to work with Docker to create and manage your own containers, and how Microsoft's new cross platform tools enable you to work with SQL Server on Windows, macOS, and Linux. After this session you'll have all the information you need to start using Docker on your platform of choice!
