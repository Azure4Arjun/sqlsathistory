## Title: Whatâ€™s your Imperative doing in my Declarative?
## Abstract:
### T-SQL is one of a minority of computer languages where you describe the results rather than code an algorithm.  Unfortunately, many people use habits and constructions learned in imperative languages such as C# or Java when writing T-SQL Code.  In this all-demo session we will explore several such commonly used constructions that are detrimental to SQL Server performance and scalability.
