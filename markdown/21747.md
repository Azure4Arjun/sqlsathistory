## Title: Store This! Why storage matters when virtualizing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server has become one of the most commonly virtualized applications. In fact, a 2012 VMware customer survey found that 52% of all SQL Server instances were virtualized, up from only 43% in 2010. Since there are multiple types of storage and various protocols that storage can be presented to the guest virtual machine, it is important that DBAâ€™s understand where the database and log files should reside for the best possible performance and ease of management.  In this session you will learn the benefits of a properly configured data management architecture for virtualized SQL Server environments which will provide easier failover, hardware abstraction and simpler capacity planning.  We will also demonstrate multiple ways to configure SQL Server storage in a virtual environment as well as best practices, caveats, and performance tips.
