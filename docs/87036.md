## Title: Keeping up with SSMS
## Abstract:
### Starting with SQL Server 2016, SSMS became a stand-alone product.  Updates are sent out a lot more frequently than in the past and it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with all of the changes and new features.  There were 7 new version releases in 2017 and 8 new version releases in 2018.  With all of the new releases, are you using SQL Server Management Studio to its fullest?  We will discuss some of the features available in the SSMS v17 and v18.

On top of the new versions, there is a lot of cool stuff available in SSMS that you may not be aware is there.  We will discuss and demonstrate some features offered in SSMS that will help make Developers and Database Administrators more productive (and everyone wants to be more productive).  Whether a DBA or a Developer, you will take away knowledge about the new SSMS versions along with some useful SSMS tips/tricks to use in SSMS that you can apply in your day to day activities.
