# Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

# Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Meagan Longoria
## Title: Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Although SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Azure Data Factory (ADF) are both used for data management processes in the Microsoft Data Platform, they are rather different tools. SSIS performs data transformation and requires a SQL Agent job or another application to schedule and execute it. ADF is an orchestration tool rather than a data transformation tool, and it has built-in scheduling capabilities. I'll explain the basics of Azure Data Factory, show how it is and isn't like SSIS, and share lessons learned from ADF projects I have completed.

# Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Emergency! Are You Ready for Disaster to Strike?
## Abstract:
### Most of the time pilots are learning to fly, they're actually learning how to recover from emergency conditions. While we as Database Administrators focus on taking backups, how much time do we actually spend practicing recovering with those backups? This session will focus on the kinds of situations that can dramatically affect a data center, and how to use checklists to practice recovery processes to assure business continuity.

# Demystifying Data Compression
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andy Mallon
## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

# Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

# Extending DevOps To SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-643)
Event Date: 05-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
## Abstract:
### Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.
