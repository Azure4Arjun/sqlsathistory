## Title: Running Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon Web Services
## Abstract:
### Amazon Web Services (AWS) has multiple ways to host and support Microsoft SQL Server.  This session will review the Relational Database Service (RDS) offering of Microsoft SQL Server as well as using our virtual machine service (Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2) to host SQL Server database services.  We will review options for security, availability, and reliability operations in both offerings and how to choose the optimal solution for your existing and new SQL Server workloads.
