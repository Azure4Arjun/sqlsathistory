## Title: Working with BimlScript to ease and automate your SSIS development
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is a great way to simplify your SSIS development to an easy-to-read XML format.  BimlScript expands this even further to allow you to embed .NET code in your Biml to have new Biml dynamically generated with schema changes at your source.  In this session, weâ€™ll talk about what BimlScript can do and give you multiple examples of how it makes SSIS package creation easier and more dynamic.
