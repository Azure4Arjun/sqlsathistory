## Speaker: Christoph Seck
## Title: Blockchain - The data platform perspective
## Abstract:
### Popularized by Bitcoin, now with Ethereum  Co already at least in version 2.x. 
What is technically behind the ominous blockchain, what does it have to do with databases and data warehousing? Are smart contracts only interesting for the financiers? And why should you program contracts? In the first part of this session, we deliver the background, and not just technically.

In the second part we take a closer look at the bitcoin blockchain as a "database". Starting point here: How anonymous really is the whole thing, when everything must be visible to everyone? After a brief introduction to its structure, we load the blockchain of bitcoin (that is, all the transactions that have been done so far) into Neo4J, a graph database and look what analyzes are possible (and why does a Graph DB work better here? And why arenâ€™t we using the new exciting Graph stuff of SQL Server 2017???) Visualization and further analysis we do with Power BI, directly connected to Neo4j.
