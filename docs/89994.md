## Title: Using Azure Databricks to Develop Scalable Data Solutions
## Abstract:
### Worried about performance when processing a Data Lake or other large data store?  Need to develop in a collaborative environment and visualize the results in Power BI?  Azure Databricks, one of the newer components added to Azure, allows users to connect to data sources such as Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL DW, Cosmos DB, Azure DB, and SQL Server and stream the data using Apache Spark to process data for a machine learning [ML] solution and provide the data to Power BI for visualization.  Azure Databricks can deliver a very quick way of processing data by adding nodes to increase performance for large data analysis tasks. Azure Databricks also includes a collaborative workspace so that using Azure Active Directory, allowing teams of people to collaboratively develop code in a notebook in R or Python and implement the notebook as an Azure Databrick job. The step-by-step demos will include all you need to know to implement Databricks.
