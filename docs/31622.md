## Title: Developing with SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### This is a high level intro of how to develop for SQL Azure either using traditional ASP.Net IIS or Windows Azure as a host. I will go over the differences between SQL Azure and Azure Storage. Considerations that need to be made if using Azure Cloud Hosting with ASP.Net Authentication and session states as well as how to use SQL Azure as a Sql(Membership,Role,Profile)Provider. I will share the tips and tricks that I have discovered as I worked with SQL Azure.
