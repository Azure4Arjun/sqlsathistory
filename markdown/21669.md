# SQLSaturday #314 - Providence 2014
Event Date: 18-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4 (ADM)
## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: Network or Perish
## Abstract:
### As IT personnel, we tend to get boxed-in, stranded on our own little island. We fail to make people aware of our activities, both within our own organization and in our wider professional circles. Just like a shipwrecked captain waiting for the rescue boat on a desert island, if you fail to communicate, your career will be stuck with no possibility of progression. This presentation will show you how to leverage networking and self-marketing techniques that will allow you to set sail off the island and into new opportunities.
