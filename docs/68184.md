## Title: Database Continuous Delivery on the Microsoft Platform
## Abstract:
### A look at the state of the art in database continuous delivery using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS), and VSTS Release Management.

The features provided by platforms such as TFS and VSTS have been widely adopted by application developers in support of modern software development practices such as continuous delivery.

In the world of database development, adoption has been much slower, due to a number of organisational and technical considerations.

This session will discuss some of the challenges associated with database continuous delivery, and the ways in which Visual Studio, SQL Server Data Tools and Visual Studio Team Services can help to improve delivery of SQL Server databases.
