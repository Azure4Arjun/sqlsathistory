## Title: The Art and Science of SQL Server Indexes (Learn when to create or drop an index)
## Abstract:
### The purpose of this lecture is to dive into the details on how the lack or excess of indexes can impact the database performance.

This will be a practical session. We will explore in more details the missing, unused, and duplicated indexes. We will learn about what they are and how they affect us and create a set of scripts based on DMVs to help us have all this information at a glance.
