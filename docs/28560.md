## Title: Storage and I/O Best Practices for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server relies heavily on a well configured storage sub-system to perform at its peak but unfortunately this is one of the most neglected or mis-configured areas of a SQL Server instance. Here we will focus on the best practices related to how SQL Server works with the underlying storage subsystem and what you can do to maximize the relationship between the two.  The core topics will include discussions on SANs vs. Direct Attached storage, Raid Groups, Caching, Types of I/O, Number of Files  their placement and more.
