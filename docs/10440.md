## Title: Somebody got BIDS Helper in my Data Tools
## Abstract:
### Do you develop SSIS packages, SSRS reports or SSAS cubes (multidimensional or tabular)? Then this class is for you! We'll cover the capabilities this free tool empowers you to perform as well as address some of the grating little quirks of BIDS/SSDT.Â 
Analysis Services Multidimensional: Roles Report, Printer Friendly Dimension Usage

SSRS: Delete Dataset Cache Files

SSIS: Deploy packages from BIDS/SSDT, Identify items with configuration/expressions, Create packages based on templates, Find differences between packages
