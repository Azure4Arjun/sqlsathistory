## Title: SQL Best Practices including tips and Tricks for optimizing your SharePoint Farm
## Abstract:
### SharePoint has become the defacto EIM tool for many large organisations and this comes with a huge responsibility for SQL DBA’s and BI consultants alike. SQL is the heart and soul of any SharePoint Farm and in this session we will be focussing on:
•	What architectural considerations there are for SQL from SharePoint
•	Real-world SQL requirements for SharePoint
•	Simple tips and tricks for SQL before deploying SharePoint
•	Best practice scenario’s for SQL pertaining to SharePoint
Invariably, SharePoint Architects have to co-exist with SQL DBA’s without having to argue and or debate what is required. DBA’s armed with the items listed above will have a better understanding of SharePoint and will also be able to optimize the performance of SharePoint DB’s so as to ensure better overall performance.
