## Title: Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling
## Abstract:
### Data modeling is all about representing the real world in the database, and for 30 years the ER Model has been the preferred method for designing databases where the goal is to "get the data in" by capturing business transactions. But the ER Model is not the most efficient model where the goal is to "get the data back out". The Dimensional Model allows us to take a very different look at all that data and restructure it in a way that is optimized for aggregation and summarizing so that we can unlock its information potential and build effective "Business Intelligence" systems. This presentation takes you "through the looking glass" to introduce you to a world of "fact tables", "dimensions", "star schemas" and more.
