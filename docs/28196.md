## Title: They Say We Shouldn't, But Let’s Do It Anyway – Ad
## Abstract:
### You know all of those things that people say you shouldn't do with Tabular models; many-to-many relationships, parent-child hierarchies, actions, etc? Let’s do those! In this session we’ll work through a few scenarios to implement some of the more advanced SSAS Tabular techniques. Not only those things that we often hear we shouldn't do (though there’s often a business case to do them), but also those advanced aspects of Tabular models and the DAX language like dynamical security, using inactive relationships and implementing a direct query model that aren't as frequently implemented. Come join me to try out all of the things we shouldn't.
