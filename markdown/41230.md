## Title: What Can Data Quality Services Do for You?
## Abstract:
### In 2002, U.S. businesses lost an estimated $600 BILLION a year because of data quality problems. In 2012, Microsoft offered Data Quality Services (DQS) to reduce some of that loss.  DQS enables analysts to recognize data quality defects and manage business rules to correct those data defects. Once defined, those business rules are available for use throughout the enterprise in SSIS packages so the data loaded is as clean as the business-defined rules. Standardizing and de-duplicating data are no match for DQS. Join me as I profile and standardize data before your very eyes.
