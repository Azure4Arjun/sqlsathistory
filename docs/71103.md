## Speaker: Brett Powell
## Title: DAX Query Use Cases
## Abstract:
### Most Microsoft BI developers are familiar with authoring DAX measures for SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular and Power BI projects. However, far fewer are experienced with writing DAX queries or integrating DAX queries into MSBI projects. 

This session includes three 20 minute segments as follows: A) DAX Query Structure and Functions B) Embedding DAX Queries into DAX Measures and C) Leveraging DAX Queries in SSRS Reports. Attendees will learn the essential concepts and functions of DAX as a query language, powerful DAX features including variables and set-based functions, and how to utilize DAX Studio to develop and test DAX queries.  

Each segment of this session will be supported by multiple example DAX queries and all queries will be made available for download following the event.
