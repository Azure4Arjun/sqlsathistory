## Title: Automated and Repeatable Test Cases for Agile SQL Server Development.
## Abstract:
### Automated and repeatable test cases are required for agile development.  In this session we will look at some of the tools and techniques for automated testing with SQL Server.  During demonstrations we will create some simple tests using the Visual Studio toolset and discuss how they can be used for Test Driven Development (TDD), unit testing, integration testing and acceptance testing.  The presentation will cover testing SQL Server Databases, SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Integration Services.
