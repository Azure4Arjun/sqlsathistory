## Title: Azure Data Factory v2 – SSIS Data Flows  Custom Extensibility
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory version 2 (ADFv2) arrived in Sept17 with a bunch of new concepts and features to support our Azure data integration pipelines. In this session, we’ll update your ADFv1 knowledge and start to understand the true nature of scale out control flows and data flows. What’s the integration runtime? Can we easily lift and shift our beloved SSIS packages into the cloud? How do we embed expressions to achieve dynamic activity executions? Do we still need SSIS with the ADF platform as a service? The answers to all these questions and more in this demo packed session. An awareness of Azure Data Factory v1 is recommended before attending this session.
