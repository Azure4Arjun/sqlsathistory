## Title: Document Classification using DMX in SSAS
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at what text mining tools are available for document classification with DMX (Data Mining Extensions). This example is a powerful yet often underutilized feature of SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services). We will walk through the process of allowing SSAS aid in document classification. We will look at criteria to decide implementations based on several different implementations. Finally we will evaluate where text mining can help you in a practical business environment.
