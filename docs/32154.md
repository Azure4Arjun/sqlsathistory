## Title: Sql and the Cloud
## Abstract:
### This talk will look at the implications of cloud computing for Sql databases. Topics covered will include: What’s in the cloud, data processing or both? Running Sql in the cloud. Sql alternatives in the cloud, SimpleDB, DIY indexing. Stuff that definitely won’t work in the cloud (not at the moment anyway). The talk will be focused mostly on the use of Amazon’s S3, SimpleDB and EC2 with a bit of Rackspace Mosso thrown in. It will demo setting up S3 buckets and EC2 instances. What’s involved in getting Sql Server running on them (including licensing implications) and discuss some of the speaker’s experience in working with the Amazon environment.
