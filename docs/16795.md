## Title: Change Data Capture for Developers and DBAs 
## Abstract:
### Change Data Capture (CDC) provides a method to store and retrieve changes from Inserts, Updates and Deletes made to SQL Server data. Metadata stored with the captured changes facilitates easy change retrieval for many potential uses like transfer to a data warehouse. 

This presentation shows how CDC works using multiple code demonstrations. The first demo illustrates how to configure CDC and capture changes. The next demonstrates practical data capture scenarios using Template Explorer code samples. 

Finally, we will explore approaches to tuning CDC and examine SSIS Controls for CDC in SQL Server 2012.
