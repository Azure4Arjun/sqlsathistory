## Title: "I Love Replication"...Something Rarely if Ever Said By DBAs But Should Be
## Abstract:
### As luck would have it you need to get data from point A to point B on a regular basis so someone suggests replication.  Many things run through your mind like maybe I could deliver the data myself I have a few thumb drives, “who is the DBA anyway?”and then finally which replication model and which type would be best to fit our needs?  This talk will go over all replication options available in SQL Server along which the many of the pitfalls and gotchas you should be aware of before setting things up. An outline of steps and processes to put in place once replication has been set up to maintain and monitor the publication will also be provided.
