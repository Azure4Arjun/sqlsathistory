## Title: Data Warehousing - How to Convince "The Bobs"
## Abstract:
### Building your first Data Warehouse is a long, and often difficult process. How can you get your boss to approve a Data Warehouse project? What’s the best way to explain dimensional modeling and the benefits of a Data Warehouse to a business person? What are the best/most cost effective ways of learning it? What kind of materials, hardware, software, etc do you need? What’s the best way to build a proof of concept that will impress your boss, as rapidly as possible?

Come to this presentation, and I’ll answer all of these questions plus the most important question of all. 

“Is this good for the company?” Absolutely.
