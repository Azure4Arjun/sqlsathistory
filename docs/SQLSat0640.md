## Title: What, When and Why, a particular database technology (relational or non-relational) to use
## Abstract:
### With availability of many choices for database technologies, developer/architect tend to make wrong selection of database systems that helps solving problem for short term but does become problem in long term. Most of these problems are result of not knowing What, When and Why to use a particular database systems but starts using it because they know, how to use it or it looks fascinating or others are using it. Session is planned to uncover myth that leads to common mistake in database system selection, guide thru focus area and provide guidance, and provide use case scenario for both relational and non-relational database systems.

## Title: Database code management with VS 2017 and RedGate
## Abstract:
### When doing agile development, whether you have 1 production target database or in case of a SaaS solution, multiple targets, database change management becomes extremely crucial. One of the challenges with traditional SSDT projects are that they work on the "as-is" model through the development cycle and obfuscate the details of how actual changes would be applied. In this session, we will look at how to use the RedGate tools now available inside Visual Studio 2017 to manage the development process and gain better control over your deployments. 

This session will cover my experiences, tips and tricks with managing a Cloud SaaS solution and we will look at how Visual Studio 2017 and the RedGate family of tools provide tremendous value and higher confidence with our product releases.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-640)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 16:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Abstract:
### Amazon Aurora is the result of being asked this question by Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO  the person responsible for the conception of AWS: "In a world where AWS exists, how would you re-design the relational database?"  What the data team came up with is a whole new paradigm shift: they built a service-oriented  decoupled architecture applied to a database engine.

Aurora has 5x the throughput comparable to enterprise commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. It’s built on AWS for the cloud, it's self-managing  self-healing. You can perform 6M inserts  30M selects per minute, scaling out further via Read Replicas. Storage automatically grows storage up to 64 TB, and more. 

Come hear about the hottest new AWS RDS database, its unique architecture and features, and learn why it's known as an "RDS Game Changer"!

# Upgrades  Rollbacks for SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-640)
Event Date: 10-06-2017 - Session time: 16:45:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Ali Razeghi
## Title: Upgrades  Rollbacks for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Are you facing a big SQL Server upgrade but are not quite sure how you will tackle it?  In this presentation we will discuss what we learned during our 2008 R2 upgrade to SQL 2014.  We will go through how we met our RTO, RCO, rollback, testing, and actual cutover process. 

We will utilize setting up and testing mirroring to move the data from 2008 to 2014. We will migrate the IP of the old 2008 cluster to the new 2014 cluster.  This way no clients change their connection strings as DNS is not an option in this environment.  Trans Replication will be set for rollback to the 2008 cluster in case we need to after going live.  We will use the 'no init' option as we do not have time to create a snapshot and will protect the data during the upgrade to ensure no writes are conducted.

Scripts and a background on transaction replication will be provided to show the end user how to start testing this process in their environment.  Pre-cutover and Post-cutover tasks will also be discussed.
