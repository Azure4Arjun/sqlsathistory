## Title: Chaos Engineering for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the concept of Chaos Engineering, its core concepts, and how it has been implemented at various companies.

Then we'll look at how it can be implemented with regard to SQL Server. SQL has various different high availability solutions but can you be sure that they'll react as expected to a real world issue? Has your HA architecture only ever been tested in a planned maintenance window?

We'll also have some fun by looking at KubeInvaders, a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes...using Space Invaders!

This session is for SQL Server DBAs and Developers who want to know how Chaos Engineering works and want to learn its main principles.
