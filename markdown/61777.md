## Speaker: Mike Oberlin
## Title: Architecting for Active/Active Operations
## Abstract:
### Active/active operations deliver the greatest uptime and capacity. But technical challenges, data integrity concerns, and cost have limited deployment. Learn how to avoid the pitfalls and deploy most efficiently, with real-world case studies.

Get real-world advice on how to support active/active ops. You'll learn:
* pros and cons of building active/active into the app code
* how cloud infrastructure helps the cost model for active/active ops but can complicate your design
* reference architectures for successful customer implementations
* case studies of companies running active/active data centers 

Attendees attending the session will: 
•	Understand the application impact of building for active/active ops
•	Learn best practices for scaled out, distributed SQL Server clusters to limit the impact of database downtime on application availability
•	Get best practices from customers on enabling active/active operations across data centers
