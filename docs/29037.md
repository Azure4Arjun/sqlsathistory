## Speaker: Bill Fellows
## Title: 45 new 2005/2008 TSQL features in 45 minutes
## Abstract:
### Too busy to read BOL to figure out what they've added?  This purely demo based presentation will give you a taste of what new language features are available to make your life easier.  Sure, you might know about CTEs and windowing functions, but what about the new data types (geospatial, xml, etc), DMOs and query hints.  Stop in and see if I can rattle off a feature a minute.
