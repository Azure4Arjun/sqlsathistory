## Title: DAX Formulas: Evaluation Context
## Abstract:
### Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is an the expression language of PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular models. Its power lies on the ability to create aggregations that are evaluated at different contexts over in-memory data. This session will explore the most challenging DAX topic: formula context. A brief comparison with MDX will be established in order to contrast the process followed by each language when establishing the context of a calculation. Attendees will gain a better understanding of how to leverage context manipulation expressions to create powerful business calculations.
