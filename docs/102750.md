## Title: AI For Good: Cognitive Services Vision
## Abstract:
### Are you curious about the role that AI will play in predictive modeling?  Are you wondering what the difference is between the Computer Vision API and the Custom Vision API?  Do you want a quick introduction to get you up to speed on both, so that you can quickly build and deploy a Cognitive Services model?

Join us for an introduction to the Cognitive Services Computer Vision and Custom Vision APIs on Azure.

In this session, we will look at the basics of Cognitive Services Vision.  First learn how to create your Cognitive Services model.  Then you can see how to train and improve accuracy.  Finally, we will step through python code in Azure Notebooks to call the APIs.

After this session, you will get up and running in Cognitive Services Vision in under an hour!

Prerequisites: Attendees should have an Azure account, as well as an account on Azure Notebooks.  Experience with coding in python is helpful, but not required.
