## Title: Organizing and Ranking SQL Result Sets
## Abstract:
### Did you know SELECT TOP 10 can return more than 10 rows, or the difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK? This query-heavy class uses many live examples to demonstrate the in’s and out’s of the TOP, RANK, DENSE_RANK and ROW_NUMBER functions; and how they will return different results depending on your data.  As an alternative for TOP for data paging, OFFSET and FETCH will be shown as an efficient alternative.
