## Speaker: Bill Anton
## Title: Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar
## Abstract:
### In the world of Power BI, data modeling is what separates the Rockstars from the Rookies. Join Bill Anton to learn how dimensional modeling - a concept developed 20+ years ago - continues to be the best approach for delivering self-service BI to the masses.

You'll learn how to create flexible data models that can be expanded upon over time, unlock the power of the date table, and a variety of DAX patterns supporting common but complex business logic.

Good data modeling will result in better Power BI solutions that support a wider range of reporting requirements and are easier for the business users to understand. 
Â 
If your Power BI solutions contain a single table, if you're frequently banging your head against the wall trying to figure out how to write a DAX calculation, or if you've never heard the term "dimensional model" this session is for you.
