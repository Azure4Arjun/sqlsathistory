## Title: Demystifying SQL in Azure
## Abstract:
### Are you thinking about runing Azure in SQL but don't understand all your options.  Do you find the terms DTU and Elastic Pools confusing.  Want to understand the difference between Azure SQL, Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure SQL Managed Instances.  If you answered yes to any of these questions, this session is for you.
In this session I will cover all of the SQL options you have available, the pros and cons of each and how to create and use each of these options.
