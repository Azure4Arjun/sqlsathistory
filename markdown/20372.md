## Title: DBA Task Automation: Unleash the PowerShell Hero in You!
## Abstract:
### As DBAs, we constantly have to stretch our time and budget resources, and the best way to keep up with demands is through process automation. Workflow and PassThru parameters are just two of the features that will allow you to turn complex tasks into simple, repeatable, automated processes easier than you would have ever dreamed possible. And if youâ€™ve had trouble with PowerShell in the past, the auto-completion and eager loading of modules will make your transition to PowerShell hero even simpler. Come see how mid-tone blue can help take your skills to the next level.
