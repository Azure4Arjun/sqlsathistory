## Title: Can Power BI Replace SSRS and should you
## Abstract:
### In this session I will take you through the differences between what you can do in SSRS and the features of Power BI. Power BI is moving very fast in features but SSRS still has features that Power BI doesn't support - on the other hand - the speed of developing reports and dashboard in Power BI is very attractive - so when should you pick the one over the other. I will cover available data sources, report- and dashboard design, how to filter and how can you publish the reports / dashboards in the two tools.
