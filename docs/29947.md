## Speaker: Don Stevic
## Title: The Art of the Trace
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been asked to troubleshoot an issue and then learned it happened a few days ago, and they wanted an root cause by 5PM?  
 Have users complained that the "Slowness" has been plauging them all day, but by the time you are told, you can't find a bottleneck?  
If you have and couldn't find answers, you need Server Side Traces. 
In this session, I will take you through the creation of a process to setup server side trances, and how to use them to baseline and
 protect your servers.
