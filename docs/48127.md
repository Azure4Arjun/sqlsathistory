## Title: DevOps Is Coming to an Enterprise near You
## Abstract:
### Companies are creating more and more technology service offerings, but they are often throttled by IT. To address this, many IT departments are adapting a new concept called DevOps. DevOps is a concept that has risen quickly from niche to mainstream within the IT enterprise. At its core, DevOps represents a way to leverage people, processes, and tools to remove barriers and improve service delivery. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server professionals. This session discusses how technologies such as virtualization, the cloud, and software-defined datacenters have blurred the lines between developers and sysdmins. We also talk about the competencies and tools required to succeed in an increasingly data-driven workplace.
