## Title: Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### Tabular modules allow developers to create models based upon different data sources; create hierarchies, perspectives, partitions and roles similar to traditional OLAP cubes.  In this session will highlight the differences between traditional OLAP and tabular models and reasons for selecting one approach over another. I will demonstrate how to create a data model first in power pivot model and then import into an Analysis Services Tabular Project.  Working with the imported data I will then create measures, KPIs, perspectives, and implement security. Finally I will deploy the model to an Analysis Server.
