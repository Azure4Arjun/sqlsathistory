## Title: Introducing SSIS in the Cloud!
## Abstract:
### Many organizations have hesitated to migrate on-prem databases to the Azure SQL Database platform because they still needed a server and license to run SSIS.  But with the recent announcement of the preview of SSIS in Azure with Azure Data Factory (ADF) v2, Microsoft has cleared this portion of the migration path.  

Come to this session to learn how to set up SSIS in Azure, migrate your existing SSIS packages, and execute packages from the cloud.
