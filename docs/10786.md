## Title: Reporting Services Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoftâ€™s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. 
** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it!!!
