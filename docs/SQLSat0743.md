# Need For Speed? Top Five SQL Server Query Tuning Tips
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#743---Pensacola-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Need For Speed? Top Five SQL Server Query Tuning Tips
## Abstract:
### Query tuning is key to peak performance in SQL Server databases. However, lots of developers and DBAs constantly struggle to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues and spend way too much time in trying to fix them. In this presentation, I will share my tried and true best practices for tuning SQL statements and other issues by utilizing Wait Time Analysis, reviewing execution plans and using SQL diagramming techniques. In addition, several case studies will be used to demonstrate these best practices.
Regardless of the complexity of your database or your skill level, this systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing, saving countless hours of tuning queries and optimizing performance of your SQL Server databases.
Learning objectives:
•	Learn how to effectively use wait types to quickly identify bottlenecks and get clues on the best tuning approach
•	Quickly identify inefficient operations through review of query execution plans
•	Learn how

# Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#743---Pensacola-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups – You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks – Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance – Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management – It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting – Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Speaker: Monica Rathbun
## Title: Always Encrypted for Beginners
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of data encryption has been the back and forth between the application and the database.  You have to overcome the obstacle of the application decrypting the data it needs.  Microsoft tried to simplify this process when it introduced Always Encrypted (AE) into SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database.  In this demo intense session, you will learn about what Always Encrypted is, how it works, and the implications for your environment. By the end you will know how to now easily encrypt columns of data and just as importantly how to unencrypt. You will also learn about the current limitations of the feature and what your options are to work around them.

## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support
## Abstract:
### What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems.

# SQL 2017 SSIS Scale Out - Why and How
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#743---Pensacola-2018)
Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Paul LaGrone
## Title: SQL 2017 SSIS Scale Out - Why and How
## Abstract:
### 2016 SSIS packages can access data anywhere throughout the network, but normally run on the server they are deployed on. And if something terrible happens to that server, the manual setup of the SSISDB can be time consuming. With 2017, SSIS packages can be deployed once and run on several servers, even simultaneously. At this meetup, Paul LaGrone will teach you how to set up 2017 SSIS Scale Out packages so that your SSIS packages can now be in a Highly Available and Disaster Recovery environment.

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.

## Title: Who's on First? SQL Server statistics  Dynamic Power BI Visuals!
## Abstract:
### What will happen when a Performance Tuner is analyzing statistics and using Power BI reports based on that analysis?  A dynamic learning experience from a different perspective.
The SQL Server optimizer uses distribution statistics when creating execution plans. Statistics are used to provide the optimizer with estimations for the best way to process the query and hopefully optimize performance.
 
Power BI is a powerful tool that has been released in the last few years that helps you visualize your information to help make informative decisions with rich visualization.
 
In this session, we will show you how SQL Server uses statistics to create the execution plan and Power BI to visualize that statistical distribution; with a TWIST.  Roles will be reversed to show a dynamic and interactive learning experience helping users with two different concepts in one exciting session!

## Speaker: David Pless
## Title: SQL SERVER 2016 / 2017 AND AZURE SQL DB: SECURITY ALL UP
## Abstract:
### We will cover many security features in SQL Server 2016/2017 such as Row Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking, Always Encrypted, Advanced Threat Detection, and the Azure Security Center covering SQL Server. 
 
Row-Level Security enables customers to control access to rows based on the characteristics of the user executing a query. RLS enables you to implement restrictions on data row access. Dynamic Data Masking limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data stored in a SQL database. Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine.
 
We will cover the Azure Security Center and Advanced Threat Detection which can be used to provide a dashboard for viewing  responding to security risks. The benefits of include configuration of SQL threat detection policy, email alerts, Azure Portal and Excel integration.

## Speaker: Sven Aelterman
## Title: On the Cutting Edge with Nodes: Graph Tables in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 introduces new schema extensions that make working with certain types of data easier and potentially more efficient. These graph extensions make it possible to create graph structures consisting of nodes and edges inside the relational database. Graphs are commonly used to describe network topology, but they are also used to model certain other types of data, including hierarchical and complex many-to-many relationships. In this talk, you will receive a brief introduction to graph concepts and some use cases for modeling data as graphs. You will then learn how to apply the new SQL Server extensions to create node and edge type tables, as well as how to efficiently query these structures.
