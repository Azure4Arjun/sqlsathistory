## Title: Don’t Panic: Use the DBA Cheat Sheet for Administrative Tasks
## Abstract:
### Do you have trouble remembering common administrative T-SQL commands? Remember when you created a cheat sheet in school to help you study for an exam?  Use that same principle with the DBA Cheat Sheet! The DBA Cheat Sheet is a document filled with some basic administrative TSQL commands you’ll need in your daily work. During the session I’ll show you a few SSMS tricks and review some of the topics in the DBA Cheat Sheet document.  You’ll leave the session with a document that you can use as a reference every day.
