## Title: Visual Studio Database Projects and Database Deployment
## Abstract:
### How does your shop keep track of changes to your database schema? What are the database deployment procedures? Do you just make changes directly in production? In this beginner level session you will learn how to easily manage your database schema by leveraging SSDT in Visual Studio with Database Projects, create deployment scripts, and generate re-runnable deployment packages called DACPAC's. We will review how source control interacts with database projects as well as discuss how you can use PowerShell to automate your database deployments.
