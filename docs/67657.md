## Title: SSIS Package generation with BIML
## Abstract:
### Ever ended up with a source system where an old datatype was replaced with a new one so you had to rebuild all your SSIS packages? 
Entered a project with SSIS packages which needed a complete rebuild to perform but you didnâ€™t have the time for a rebuild of your whole project?
Client specifications changed (again) and you had to start all over again building all your packages?

We did it all and rebuild 100+ SSIS packages within a day using biml for generating SSIS packages. 
And with a generator at hand, we were able to absorb a new version of a source system including analysis of the changes made in the source in only two days. And the best of all, BIML is part of BIDSHelper and free to use!
Don' t just believe what I say, In my session I will demonstrate where to start. 
I will show you around in BIML. After the quick basics of BIML I will show you how you can parameterize the BIML script in order to multiply the template to multiple packages over and over again.
