## Title: How the Query Optimizer Works
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer is the component of SQL Server that attempts to determine the best way to execute a query by finding an efficient execution plan. This session will show you how a better understanding on how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your databases. See how you can provide SQL Server with appropriate statistics and indexes so it can perform better cardinality estimation and produce an efficient execution plan. Learn how you can troubleshoot problems if you are not getting an efficient execution plan and how you can use other alternatives like hints or plan guides to help the query optimizer to produce a better plan.
