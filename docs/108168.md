## Title: Self-service BI - Why Data Modelling Is Still Important

### Self-service business intelligence is on the rise. Tools like Power BI, Power Query and Power Pivot make it easy for everyone to create a powerful model that can hold millions of rows. However, it's not all cookies and rainbows. To get good performance and correct results, a good data model is required. In this session, we go over the basics of data modelling for business analysis.
