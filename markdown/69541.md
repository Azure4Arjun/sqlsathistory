## Title: From SSAS to Azure Analysis Services - Lessons learned
## Abstract:
### Seeing a potential in jumping on board the latest and greatest we decided to start using Azure Analysis Services from the start to supplement/replace our ‘old’ SSAS Tabular 2012 production setup.
Promises of using level 1400 features, easy/better sharing to our customers, no management overhead, and all the usual cloud benefits, well, being a small company, the decision seemed like a slam dunk. After the initial test deployment, reality set in and we had to deal with:
Deployment, Processing, Security, Monitoring, Debugging, Stability, Performance and Capacity.
Without having all the answers I’ll share our experience in terms of benefits, challenges and how we made it work.
