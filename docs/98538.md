## Title: Avoiding angry calls: Power BI model optimization
## Abstract:
### It's easy to get started with Power BI, but it's also easy to end up with an out-of-control data model that grinds your report visuals and refreshes to a halt.  How can you find and fix the problems slowing down your Power BI performance?  In this session we'll show you common pitfalls to avoid, along with handy tools to help you maintain and optimize your models, whether you created them yourself or inherited them from others.  You'll leave this session armed with the tools and knowledge you need to immediately improve the performance, organization, and readability of your models, as well as monitor for the future to prevent those angry calls.
