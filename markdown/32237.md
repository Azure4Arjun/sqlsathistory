## Title: Designing Re-Startable SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### SSIS provides the Checkpoint functionality for recovery after a package failure, but many experienced SSIS developers eschew it because of its lack of granularity when restarting a failed package. Sometimes the restarted package will execute tasks that had partially succeeded previously, causing data consistency issues or outright data destruction! In this session, you will see SSIS package design that allows predictable, scalable recovery after a partial or complete failure during execution. Intended for experienced SSIS developers with knowledge of SSIS Expressions and T-SQL.
