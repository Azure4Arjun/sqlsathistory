## Title: Data Quality:  Boosting Software Performance and Business Profit
## Abstract:
### If "Data is the Lifeblood of Modern Business," then most businesses are walking corpses with sludge in their veins, because 10% to 25% of all data records in the average enterprise are wrong.  Until the dramatic problems of Data Quality Management are addressed, SQL can never fulfill its original promise to eliminate application "silos", enable systems to communicate and provide useful, actionable information to the modern business.  I believe that we are on the cusp of a revolution in Data Quality that is even greater in scope and impact than the revolution in manufacturing quality that began over 40 years ago.  Businesses that make the transition will survive and thrive.  Those that don't will finally stop shambling about and lay down to die.What is this revolution in Data Quality?  How can you be a part of it (and avoid the headman's ax)?!?  This presentation will change the way you think about your jobs as Database Administrators and Application Developers.
