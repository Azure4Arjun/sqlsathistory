## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

# Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-597)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 10:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
## Abstract:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.

# It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-597)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Speaker: Jeremy Frye
## Title: Speed Up Your SSAS Cube's Data Refresh With Dynamic Partition Processing
## Abstract:
### Are you sometimes plagued with the unfortunate event of your multidimensional SSAS cube refresh exceeding the scheduled maintenance window?  Maybe you simply need to update recent data to reflect a critical change during business hours, but can’t afford several hours of downtime.  I have a solution for you!  In this session, we will focus on building an ETL framework while leveraging your cube’s logical partition design to dynamically process only the necessary data within your measure group.  We will discuss audit logging, cube processing options, partition design and metadata access.  These techniques and strategies will provide a faster data refresh process for your warehouse or data mart.

# Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-597)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone
## Abstract:
### Database provisioning requests are the bane of many DBA’s working lives. Developers want to work with realistic data, DBAs want to protect Production and secure data.
 
But copying databases for development and test is a job that gets 'delegated up'; DBAs, IT Managers, those with the keys to Production find themselves performing the task, and the development team is often blocked while it takes place.
 
The same people are often responsible for ensuring the copy is appropriate for the environment (permissions, configuration data, sensitive data), so have to perform semi-manual tasks and maintain brittle scripts to do so.
 
In this session Redgate’s Grant Fritchey shows how new tool SQL Clone enables self-service or easy automation of database copies and is near-instant at the time of need, using a fraction of the disk space, and allowing quick reversion to a baseline or snapshotting of changes.

Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog
## Abstract:
### The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.

## Speaker: Robert Miller
## Title: SQL lessons learned operating at scale
## Abstract:
### When your SQL Server environment runs 24*7 and is *very sensitive* to interruptions, how one performs basic maintenance activities, supports development and deployment, and ensures proper backups requires a different mindeset for performing these tasks.
Everything from how you implement SQL Server to how a table is designed requires a different thought process when the daily "overnight" or weekly "downtime" windows do not exist.  
Everything you do happens alongside and impacts user-facing activity.
In this session I will present various high-level lessons learned along the path of user happiness in an always-in-use environment.

# How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-597)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 14:15:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Ryan McCauley
## Title: How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: I/O Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

# Change Detection in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-597)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Change Detection in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Change detection is a critical component of any system that moves data from one structure to another. Most data movement mechanisms are designed to move a subset of the data – only that which is new or changed since the last load. For that to work properly, there must be a reliable system for detecting delta data touched since the most recent load. 

In this session, we will review the tools and design patterns available in SQL Server for performing change detection. From source detection methods including change tracking and change data capture, to in-flight comparisons using hashed values, and even brute-force methods as a last resort, we’ll cover the spectrum of change detection tools in SQL Server.
