## Title: Experience SQL Server on Linux and Containers
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 is all about choice. It now runs on the most popular platforms in the world: Windows, Linux, and Docker Containers. In this session we will focus on the specific features, architecture, and guidance for running SQL Server on Linux and Docker Containers. You will walk away with an understanding of how we built SQL Server on Linux and how it runs in a unique way that allows developers to focus on their applications vs the specifics of the design. We will also look at how Docker Containers work so you can see the unique value proposition this provides to developers using SQL Server.
