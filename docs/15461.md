## Title: Data Warehouse Design and Best Practices
## Abstract:
### A data warehouse is a database designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing. An appropriate design leads to scalable, balanced and flexible architecture that is capable to meet both present and long-term future needs. This session covers a comparison of the main data warehouse architectures together with best practices for the logical and physical design that support staging, load and querying.
Join this session to learn various architectural approaches our team evaluated for a 50â€™000+ hours EU project.
