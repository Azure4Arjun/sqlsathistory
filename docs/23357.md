## Title: Get ready, here is the cloud
## Abstract:
### A few years ago we told you to learn PowerShell. At this moment Windows Server 2012 R2 ships with a couple of thousand PowerShell commandlets. Now we tell you the cloud is coming and it's called Microsoft Azure. In this session I will tell you what the cloud exactly is and what it not is. How safe is your data? And why should you consider moving to the cloud? Once you get a better understanding of the concepts of Microsoft Azure and cloud platforms in general you might change opinions on the future of the cloud
