## Title: Running SQL Server workload on AWS
## Abstract:
### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) supports six different engines and MS SQL Server is one of them. Bring your SQL Server workload to RDS and have AWS manage your hardware, OS, database engine, backups, High-Availability and scalability amongst other things. So, you can focus on application tuning and development.
