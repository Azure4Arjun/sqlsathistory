## Title: Azure and SQL Server: Getting the best out of the cloud
## Abstract:
### SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds, reducing operational costs.
 
For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs
we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart
ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost.

In this session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios
between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do
with your SQL Server infrastructure.
