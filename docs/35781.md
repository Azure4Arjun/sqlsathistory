## Title: Punishing Yourself with Continuous Delivery
## Abstract:
### Do you deploy code once every couple of months, or quartersâ€¦. or years?  Is deployment terrifying and fraught with catastrophes?  Then why not do it more often?  Continuous Delivery (CD) takes deployment to the next level, turning the terror of pushing out code into happiness, sunshine and butterflies.  CD is the practice of maintaining the deployment pipeline so that new features can be delivered quickly and with fewer failures.  This session will cover how to do CD in a Business Intelligence Environment.
