## Title: Putting Traces  SQL Profiler To Work
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will explore the tracing architecture present in SQL 2005/8 and how it is leveraged by the GUI tool Microsoft provides, SQL Profiler.  An initial knowledge base will be established on traces, what they are, how to define them, and how they affect a system.  From here, we will apply them to real-world scenarios and be able to immediately see their importance in everyday operations of both DBAs and developers.
