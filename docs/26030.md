Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Rapson 56
## Speaker: Terry Bunio
## Title: Agile Data Warehouse - The final frontier 
## Abstract:
### Come to this session and learn about why you should always create a data model for enterprise applications. This session will review the benefits and functionality that typically is provided by most data modeling tools. Learn why a data model needs to be more that just a collection of SQL scripts. Many projects try to version their models in a manually manner by generating SQL change scripts and checking them in. This labour intensive process frequently turns out to be not scalable and does not integrate well into the  development process. This session will also share a process that was used to version database changes directly from a data model.
