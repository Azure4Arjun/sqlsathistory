## Title: Introduction to Application Security
## Abstract:
### Do you ever get the feeling that your Information Security department is out to make your life hard? Do you think perhaps they think the same thing about developers? (hint: They usually do.) Have you ever wondered how you could make that relationship better? Then this session is for you! 


In this introduction to application security we will go over the “basics” of security, specifically in regards to web applications. We will touch on things like what that OWASP thing is, the differences between authorization and authentication, and why most Two-Factor authentication has an off by one error. We will also look at ways to test your applications for security vulnerabilities so that the next time you hand your applications off to the security team you can have a better feeling about the results you will get back.
