## Title: Mom Rules for Managing Enterprise Database Environments
## Abstract:
### Have you ever looked at an environment and wondered how the heck they ever got anything done because it is so disorganized?

Not only does organization make the environment easier to maintain, it can help speed up trouble shooting.  Good organization can even help with some performance issues.
