Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: How to screw up Database DevOps in 16 simple steps
## Abstract:
### DevOps has revolutionised our ability to deliver customer value.

Updates aren’t held up in 6-month release cycles. We’ve automated tests and deployments collaboratively so we know updates work. A virtuous cycle of innovation and testing allows us to build better, more reliable products faster and cheaper.

However, while that’s great in theory, I’ve seen people screw up spectacularly when applying DevOps to relational databases.

In this cheerful session I’ll review the 16 most popular ways to screw up your ability to deliver database updates, resulting in painful, fragile deployments and expensive legacy databases that no-one likes to maintain.

A session for developers *and* DBAs.

#### [Back to calendar](#nr-729)
Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: COZYROC: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

#### [Back to calendar](#nr-729)
Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Stan Siranovich
## Title: How to do a Data Analysis
## Abstract:
### You log into your email first thing in the morning and the rumors are confirmed; your company is expanding with branch offices in three new cities. As you read, the Big Boss drops by your cubicle and says that she needs an analysis of the real estate situation in all three cities. The analysis needs to include summaries of prices based on factors such as number bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and number of square feet. It should include lots of visualizations, be clear and easy to understand, and point out any interesting relationships that you've uncovered. And you need to have it done by 11:30 a.m.

We'll show you how to do this with real, publically available data from Redfin, using JMP statistical analysis and visualization software. We'll start with concatenation and subsetting, move on to data integrity, then to visualization, exploratory data analysis, and simple linear regression. We'll make plenty of charts and graphs with some summary statistics thrown in for good measure.

Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tracy Boggiano
## Title: Intro to Query Store
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Tuning capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.

Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Andrew Loree
## Title: Getting started with Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Do you have large amounts of data which you want to leverage to predict the answers to difficult questions?  The seemingly new field of Machine Learning (ML) has been around for almost 60 years, with this exact goal in mind. 

In this session, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of ML, to get you started without requiring a mathematics background.  We will look at how to “frame” your data questions, as well as understanding the type of outputs ML can provide in responding with predictions.   Focus will be placed on the high-level overview of the ML process, and spend time on the simple steps of determining the “right” algorithm to use.  Tools used include Weka and Azure ML Studio, but the focus of the session is on fundamentals and the ML process, not specific toolsets.

Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: 5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits
## Abstract:
### Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.

# Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-729)
Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Since the early days of SQL Server, it has been possible to use basic security measures to allow (and disallow) user access to any object in a database, and even limit access to a given column. A more difficult task has been to limit access to the individual rows in a table. This has made application development more complex because whereas most every user may have access to a table like HR.Employee, not every employee will have access to every employee's data. In this session I will cover several techniques to limit access to rows, from methods that have existed since early versions of SQL Server, to the new Row Level Security feature in SQL Server 2016. If time permits, an overview of Dynamic Data Masking will be included, since it is a related technology.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?
## Abstract:
### Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.

Event Date: 21-07-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.

## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer
## Abstract:
### There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.

## Speaker: Jonathan Stewart
## Title: Relationship Goals:  The SQL Server Graph Database
## Abstract:
### Relational databases have their strengths.  Ironically data relationships are not one of them.  Graph databases excel in this department using nodes and edges.  They are optimized to find and view relationships using graph theory.

One of the best new features of SQL Server 2017 is the Graph Database!  It brings us the best of both worlds in one easy platform!  Come learn about the history of graph databases, how they work and why you should be using it!

## Title: SQL Server ColumnStore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Come and learn how the SQL Server feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will also have some insight into how CSI's have been updated in SQL Server 2014  beyond.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.
