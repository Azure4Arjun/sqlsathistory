Event Date: 06-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Aaron Cutshall
## Title: The Lost Science of Set Theory
## Abstract:
### Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.

# Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#531---Louisville-2016)
Event Date: 06-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.
