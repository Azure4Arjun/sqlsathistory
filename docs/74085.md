## Title: Introduction to Object-Relational Mapping for DBAs
## Abstract:
### This talk introduces DBAs to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) from the point of view of a software developer creating a simple website.  Aside from introducing ORM I'll explain why developers like to use them, their strengths and weaknesses, and how DBAs and ORM developers can work together in perfect harmony.
