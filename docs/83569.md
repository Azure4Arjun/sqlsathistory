## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server [EN]
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2016 introduced the most important change to query tuning in ages, the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works in Azure, SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. You will learn how Query Store changes the methods you use to troubleshoot and tune query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but youâ€™ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server databases.
