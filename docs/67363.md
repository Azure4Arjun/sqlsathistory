## Title: Who Needs Numbers? Patterns for Non-Numeric Measures in DAX
## Abstract:
### Visualizations are wonderful, but they can be misinterpreted, and often, the space they occupy is disproportionate to the value they add. Enhance the functionality of your SSAS Tabular and Power BI output, by understanding HOW-, WHY- and WHEN to leverage the power of DAX to create text, date or Boolean measures.

We'll start the session by understanding what a Non-Numeric Measure is, and identifying situations in which they can be applied. Once we have that in place, we'll learn patterns for creating various Non-Numeric Measures and then we'll put our new knowledge to use by seeing Non-Numeric Measures in action, both in SSAS Tabular, and Power BI.
