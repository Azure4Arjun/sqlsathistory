## Title: The Super Trace: Introduction to Extended Events 
## Abstract:
### Extended Events are a powerful weapon for tracing even the smallest details inside SQL Server's engine. In this session we'll introduce the feature, it's components and creation and processing of a session. We will highlight differences with similar tools like Profiler and we'll walk through the GUI for working with Extended Events as we go through demos of common situations that XEvents handle perfectly.
