## Title: Zero to Hero with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### There are two kinds of people in the SQL Server world. Those who are using PowerShell, and those that will be. In this session you'll learn how to become one of the "cool kids" using PowerShell.

In this session we'll start with the basics, like cmdlets, variables, and the IDE. But we'll quickly transition to more advanced topics like flow control, functions, and creating  your own objects. By the time you are done you'll have a good grasp on how to implement your own solutions in PowerShell.
