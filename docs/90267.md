## Title: In-Memory Capabilities in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The Enterprise Edition of SQL Server 2016 contains 2 powerful features for database and data warehouse developers to improve performance and scalability. One is columnstore indexes and the other is in-memory optimized tables. In this presentation I'll show several examples with large databases on how you can get the most out of these 2 great features. I'll cover the scenarios and contexts where columnstore indexes and in-memory optimizes tables work best.
