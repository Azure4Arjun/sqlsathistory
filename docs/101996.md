## Speaker: Alberto Ferrari
## Title: DAX Optimization Examples
## Abstract:
### How do you optimize a DAX expression? In this session we analyze some DAX expressions and Tabular models and, through the usage of DAX Studio and some understanding of the VertiPaq model, we will look at how to optimize them.
As you will see, most optimizations are the direct application of best practices, but the session has the additional takeaway of understanding what kind of performance you should expect from your formulas, and the improvement you might expect from learning how to optimize the model and the code.
