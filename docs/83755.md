## Title: WIT Luncheon: Women Participation at Conferences/Workshops/Technical Market
## Abstract:
### Technical conferences generally have a paucity of women speakers. Many have none at all, some have a token woman, and most have a minority around the 10% mark. Only a very few conferences have a strong minority (>25%) of women speakers. Conferences with "soft" subject matter such as web design, user interfaces, or community management tend to have higher proportions of female speakers than those with "harder" subject matter.

Weâ€™ve assembled a panel of presenters and women in tech to delve into the causes, solutions and provide tips for women or diversity of speakers at technical conferences.

This session will be presented by Capital Region Women in Technology:
