## Title: IoT in the wild [DE]
## Abstract:
### In this session the learnings and architecture of an implemented IoT prototype will be presented. It implements a full working IoT solution with as less as possible individual coding and as such ready “made” components were preferred. Therefore, components like Azure IoTHub, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Logic Apps, Azure SQL Database, Power BI, and many more were put together. The implemented approach includes alarming, aggregation (Stream Analytics) and concludes with Machine Learning processes.

You will see an active solution with all parts working in a ready-made demo up to the dashboards in Power BI. So get ready for an interesting practical view on IoT in the "wild".
