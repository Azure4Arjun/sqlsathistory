## Title: Save Time and Merge It
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server 2008 MERGE command combines the features of the Insert and Update commands into a single powerful statement.  You can now insert new data into one table while also update or delete data from an existing table with a single statement.  In this session, we will take a look at this new addition to your TSQL toolbox in SQL Server 2008 to show how to merge two tables without creating duplicate records, how to synchronize two tables, how to use the OUTPUT clause with MERGE to save deleted records from the merge into an archival table, how indexing effects performance of MERGE statements and more.
