## Title: SQL Server 2008 Date / Time Data Types
## Abstract:
### This session provides an overview of date / time data types, comparing capabilities and benefits of the new types in SQL Server 2008 with those from prior versions.  A process will be presented on how to profile date / time data content in current tables, to better understand the implications (data preservation or loss) in migrating existing date / time data types to the newer types.  Tools to simplify the data profiling process will be demonstrated.
