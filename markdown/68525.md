## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 Just Works! But if you are a IT Professional you want to be armed with all the right diagnostics to react to a mission critical problem or tune the engine to the needs for your business. Dev-Ops also requires the right tools to build and tune queries for maximum performance. SQL Server 2016 and 2017 have all the diagnostics you need just built-in to the product. These are the foundation for great tools from vendors such as SentryOne, RedGate, SolarWinds, and Idera. We also have intelligence built-into the engine based on these diagnostics to automate, learn, and adapt.
