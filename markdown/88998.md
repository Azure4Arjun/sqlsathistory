## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn how SQL Server 2019 implements an elastically scalable storage layer that integrates SQL Server on Linux, PolyBase, Containers, Kubernetes, Spark and HDFS to scale to petabytes of data storage. You’ll get a complete explanation about the architecture for this platform, and you’ll also learn about common use case scenarios for using big data clusters.
