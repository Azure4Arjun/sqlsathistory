## Title: Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.
