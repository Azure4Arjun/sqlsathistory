## Title: Writing Your First BimlScript
## Abstract:
### In this highly interactive presentation, I'll guide you through the process of creating your first BimlScript. During the process we'll cover the basics of Biml syntax, language options for generating BimlScript, recommended methods of storing and using metadata to drive your BimlScipts, and a lot more. As an added bonus, you'll leave the presentation with several BimlScripts you can adapt to use in your own environments.
