## Title: Moving Beyond Unconscious Bias
## Abstract:
### People love patterns. We simplify our lives by categorizing all day long – things, activities, and even people. Categories let us make sense of a constant bombardment of sensations.

Let’s talk about what we can do to shake up those categories and drive towards a more diverse and productive workplace.
