## Title: More Performance? YES WE CAN!
## Abstract:
### I find performance tuning to be one of the most challenging and interesting tasks as a DBA.
In a session based on demonstrations, I'll show some real live performance issues and give tips that will boost performance from 4 to 100 times!
Examples will cover both application queries and maintenance tasks and I'm sure you'll like it :-)
