## Speaker: Lori Edwards
## Title: How To Plan Meetings That Work
## Abstract:
### Too often we find ourselves in meetings that seem to have no purpose, that run long and we walk out with little more information than we started with.  In this session, you’ll learn how to organize meetings that are both efficient and effective from the start.  We’ll provide tips to help with participation, keeping the meeting rolling and even ending on time.   Be the person whose meetings people actually look forward to.  Both Lori and Allen have years of experience participating in and planning meetings both for work and volunteer settings including the PASS Board of Director, Election Review Committee and the Nominations Committee meetings.
