## Title: Advanced indexing
## Abstract:
### So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!I will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries, But I will also show the dangers of using too many indexes, and the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes.
