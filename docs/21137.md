## Title: Mission Critical Confidence – (SQL 2012/2014 AlwaysOn) and Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### AlwaysOn is SQL Server 2012/2014’s High Availability solution. It provides a new standard for mission critical databases and end-to-end business intelligence at a lower total cost of ownership. It provides the required 9S of availability without the total cost and complexity. In this session, we’ll specifically explore high availability databases – Availability Groups. AG is a new feature that enhances and combines database mirroring and log shipping. We’ll demonstrate the setup and failover of multiple databases simultaneously.
