## Speaker: Mark Broadbent
## Title: The Irish Economic Crisis, Visualized
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis as it unfolded, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.   It starts from a very common business perspective, needing to make sense of data, fast, but not knowing what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.   This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis.
