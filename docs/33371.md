## Title: Introduction to Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### SQL Server replication allows DBAs to distribute data to various servers throughout an organization. Some reasons to employ replication include load balancing, offline processing  redundancy. Transactional replication in particular can offer a very flexible solution where data frequently changes. This session will discuss the basics of planning and implementation of a solid transactional replication solution as well as alternatives we may wish to realize.
