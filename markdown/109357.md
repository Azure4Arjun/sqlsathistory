## Title: Why my query is slow and how to make it fast
## Abstract:
### Generally, there are only two options for query slowness: either the query itself is slow (high CPU time), or the query is waiting for some resource (high Wait time) - all other reasons for query slowness derive from these two options. Well, I have to admit it is not that easy, there are a lot of things which can slow down the query, and the slowness root cause is among them. In this session, I will show you the approach which I use for query performance tuning. We will look through the bunch of queries, their query plans, execution statistics, DMV's and extended events to identify the slowness root cause and optimize the queries.
