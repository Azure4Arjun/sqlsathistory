## Speaker: Chris Shaw
## Title: Outages; Dispatchers, Cops and Detectives
## Abstract:
### Recently I watched the news as a crisis situation was played out. There were police officers were running around, moving behind large solid objects like cars, putting on their protective gear.  At first it looked like mass chaos but after watching it closely the officers moved like a well-oiled machine. 
 
The more I watched the more I realized that as database professionals we have crisis situations as well. As the situations are compared there are a number of things that we can learn by watching how other professionals handle crisis.  This session is dedicated to looking at how others handle crisis so that we can learn from what they do.
