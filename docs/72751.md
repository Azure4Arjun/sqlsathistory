## Speaker: Rodrigo Crespi
## Title: PowerShell for SQL Server DBAs
## Abstract:
### In this session you will fall in love for PowerShell!
Come to know how the PowerShell works, how to use the .NET Framework, WMI, several PowerShell modules and how to create your own module for administration tasks in mixed and distributed environments.
Based in my experience since 2008 and with a previous experience in Linux environments, the PowerShell is highly useful tool for admin SQL Server instances and databases.
See you then!
