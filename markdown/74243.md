## Title: Bringing DevOps to your database
## Abstract:
### Application code deployment is an easy thing as long as it is stateless. But what about the databases which are intrinsically stateful?
Have you ever deployed a new release of your database schema manually? How sure were you that you followed 100% of the steps from you deployment list. Do you feel nervous when the time for a new release comes by?
I will show you how to introduce the DevOps principles to your databases in order to be much effective in your business and significantly reduce the lead time.
The technologies we are going to have in our tool belts are SQL Server Database Tools, Azure Resource Manager and Release Management in VSTS(Visual Studio Team Services). For the advanced scenarios, we will take a look at Build  Deployment Contributors.
