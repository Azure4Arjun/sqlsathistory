## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: The Ticking Timebombs in Your Databases
## Abstract:
### You've worked hard to build the best systems you can, and then one night you get called in to resolve a production incident.  As you peer into your database, you see it: something so bad it sends shivers down your spine.  How did that get in there?  Who did that? Why? And how do you fix it?

In this session, we look at the workarounds, technical debt and clever designs that can cause you grief when you least expect it.  We will also include perfectly fine features that can haunt you later. We will discuss how these things happen and give you tools to identify the ones that cause the most pain.

Join us: you'll keep your job, have happier users and get more rest.
