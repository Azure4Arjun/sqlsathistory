## Title: Your own Private Cloud for SQL
## Abstract:
### Can SQL Server be offered as a service (SQLaaS) in your own private cloud?  Can it provide application teams with the ability to easily procure an instance of SQL Server quickly?  You may have some elements of this created in your environment but how do you create the full service offering?  Creating a SQLaaS offering is a lot easier than you think and many companies are now ready for this change.  In this session, you will learn how to design a SQL Server service offering for the Private Cloud that will enable your organization to react faster to the increasing project demands.
