## Title: What's your DQ (Data Quotient) ?
## Abstract:
### You've heard of IQ (and you're is probably high) and EQ (Emotional Quotient), but have you heard of DQ ( Data Quotient). Your DQ is your skill or ability to "smell" good data, excellent data patterns, and great queries. In this session we'll look at several examples of good, bad, and ugly data and you'll grade your DQ. Fun, educational, and potentially full of brag-rights.
