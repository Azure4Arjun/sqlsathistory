## Title: Minimize Data Loss with Advanced Restore Methods 
## Abstract:
### Data loss can strike any server at any time. Are you prepared for the inevitable? A good DBA takes regular backups and practices regular restores; a great DBA has advanced restore techniques planned and tested. In this session, I will demonstrate three advanced restore methods that can make you a great DBA - point-in-time restores, page restores, and piecemeal restores, and will discuss the appropriate situations when each should be considered. Attend this session to better protect your business and your job.
