## Title: Faster Insights From Any Data
## Abstract:
### Today’s organizations face growing challenges extracting business value from their data. The need for rapid insight is made more challenging by the expanding volume, complexity, and velocity of data. Traditional approaches to information management fail to harness this “data deluge”. New paradigms for data management and data analytics are emerging. Transformation of data to business insight requires a holistic approach that aligns the right platforms, technologies, and processes to support the decision process and analysis that business demands. During the session, we will the examine the Microsoft’s vision of enabling organizations to manage any data at any scale while empowering business users through self-serve information management and self-serve business intelligence. Through demos and interactive discovery we  will explore how the PowerBI BI tools can be used with Hadoop /HDInsight to accelerate organizations’ journey from data to insight.
