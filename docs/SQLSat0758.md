## Speaker: Denys Chamberland
## Title: Azure Cosmos DB + Gremlin API in Action
## Abstract:
### Graph databases have been around in various
forms for a long time, in a wide range of data analysis from science technology
to business scenarios. However, there may still be a small pool of T-SQL
experts with graph experience, especially dealing with Gremlin traversal query language.
That's fully understandable. The session is not aimed on encouraging users to stop
using T-SQL, but rather giving them a new performing blade on their data analysis Swiss knife so to
speak. This session will start with a quick overview of new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API options
It will then expose main comparaison between T-SQL vs Gremlin, and reasons why
graph may be more beneficial.
It will then give a basic introduction of Gremlin Transversal topology in real context.
Finally a demo will cover how to create a new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API project
from Visual Studio Code. 
1.Generating Vertex and Edges through Core 2.0 Console Application +  
2.Consuming Graph API data query in Core .2.0 Web client.

## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: Time intelligence and date tables in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Every Power BI model has dates and the need of calculation over dates to aggregate and compare data, like Year-To-Date, Same-Period-Last-Year, Moving Average, and so on. Quick measures and DAX functions can help, but how do you manage holidays, working days, weeks based fiscal calendars and any non-standard calculation’
This session provides you the best practices to correctly shape a data model and to implement time intelligence calculations using both built-in DAX functions and custom DAX calculation for more complex and non-standard requirements.

## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.

# Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization

Event Date: 02-06-2018 - Session time: 11:00:00 - Track: Database administration and performance management
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size. Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is often too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially if not production. More importantly, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive. The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is very true with data.

Because providing full databases for each developer on each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared non-production environments that are refreshed only every few months at best. Conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Clone things easily and quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns
## Abstract:
### Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?

## Title: My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?
## Abstract:
### Abstract	You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?
This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.
At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.

## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Self-Service ETL with Power Query
## Abstract:
### Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transform, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.

## Speaker: Christophe Laporte
## Title: Les bases du dépannage SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server, base de données la plus vendue en nombre de licences, reste relativement facile à administrer, tout en offrant un niveau de performance de premier ordre et une fiabilité excellente. Combien de "pannes" avec vous eu lors des 5 ou 10 dernière années ? Attention, ne me faites pas dire que l'on peut se passer des systèmes de haute disponibilité, FCI ou groupes de disponibilité. Il suffit de déterminer le RPO et le RTO et de monnayer l'indisponibilité du serveur pour déterminer si une stratégie de disaster recovery suffit, ou bien s'il faut prévoir la mise en haute disponibilité des ressources SQL.
Au final, le logiciel est fiable et ne provoque que très rarement des erreurs, des "plantages". 
Par contre, au quotidien, cela ne veut pas dire qu'il ne va pas y avoir de problèmes sur l'instance, principalement de connexion, d'autorisation ou de performance.
Au cours de cette session, nous allons aborder les bases du diagnostic et du dépannage SQL Server.

## Speaker: Mohamed Mawla
## Title: Mapping SQL Server Expertise to Azure Cortana Intelligence - Cases and Scenarios
## Abstract:
### Platform as Service offerings now enables developers to roll out their database infrastructure in minutes with minimal management overhead. However, this same amount of flexibility also comes with the challenges of picking the right tool, on the right provider and with the proper expectations. All of these are new challenges that are coming into the field of responsibility of the SQL DBA professional.

In this session, we'll map Cloud offerings, mainly Azure, that corresponds to the current features SQL Server DBAs use, their use cases for each one based on our client projects, and how they are different to the different SQL Server features we are familiar with. The goal is to get SQL Server DBAs on the latest Azure offerings and the echo of Cortana Intelligence.  If time allows, we will also show some offerings from Google Cloud.

## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Query Optimization Techniques
## Abstract:
### How often have you been told that an application is running "too slow"?  This statement is the cause of a great deal of investigation, frustration, and dead-ends for database professionals.

The problem won't always be a bad query, but when it is, knowing how to dive in, diagnose its performance, and resolve the situation efficiently will turn a potentially frustrating situation into a fun one!  Using that knowledge in development to prevent future performance issues will improve script quality and application design, while making your future self less burdened by performance emergencies.

This is an opportunity to identify common query mistakes and learn a variety of ways in which we can solve them.  This discussion will include query rewrites, indexing, statistics, database design, monitoring, execution plans, and more!

Demos of poor-performing queries will be provided to illustrate key optimization techniques, design considerations, and the tools you need to fix them.  Fast.
