## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: C# Ninjitsu
## Abstract:
### C# has humble beginnings as an object oriented language of the purest kind. It was class-based, it was imperative, and it was component-oriented. For many years, the classic object-oriented design principles served class library designers well. But C# is no longer a purely object oriented language. It is no longer an imperative, class-based, component oriented discipline. It is also a generic, declarative, functional discipline. I will reexamine the object-oriented principles and introduce new principles. I will then introduce new refactorings as we move toward a more declarative, fluent world.
