## Title: Elements of Storage Performance
## Abstract:
### Today it is possible to achieve exceptional storage performance for SQL Server without excessive costs. Unfortunately the solution proposed by storage system vendors generally ignores the special characteristics of database engines (not just SQL Server), resulting in marginal if not poor performance. Learn how to match the hardware elements of storage including IO channels, the role of cache, and the components hard drives, SSD - both enterprise class and lower cost options to the characteristics of SQL Server IO to achieve realizable query performance.
