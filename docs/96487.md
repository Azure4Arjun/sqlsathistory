## Title: Polyglot persistence in the real world
## Abstract:
### With the emergence of big data, many databases have evolved to accommodate the vast amount and variety of data. Each bank has different characteristics and is therefore best used in different situations. There are even applications that in different functionalities, would be more performative with databases of different types. This is what we call polyglot persistence, a single application talking to different banks. This lecture seeks to clarify what polyglot persistence means, brings cases into the subject and presents tools that make the abstraction of banks acting as a single interface and allowing the data joining from different databases.
