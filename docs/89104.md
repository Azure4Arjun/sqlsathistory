## Title: Time Intelligence in Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Pick any reporting solution, analysis based on Time (mostly Date) is almost always essential. Business users would want to know measures such as: How was Sales, What was Sales year-over-year, year-to-date? Did our Expenses go down? Compared to similar period last year? etc. etc.

In this session I will show you, using DAX functions in Azure (and on-premise) Analysis Services, how you can develop Date based dimensions and measures that will help answer such questions.
