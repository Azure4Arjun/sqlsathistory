## Title: Governing Power BI in large organizations, A story from a global classification company
## Abstract:
### Self-Service BI is a transition for most organizations. Moving from the traditional IT corporate reporting to enabling employees to serve themselves across an organization, requires a governance process and managing tools and frameworks. This session will cover the most ciritcal governance aspects a large organization needs to consider when implementing Power BI as a corporate and self-service BI tool- mostly focusing on the self-service part. I will bring in real world examples from a global classification company (+10 000 employees) which is using Power BI company wide and where Power BI adoption is increasing rapidly.
