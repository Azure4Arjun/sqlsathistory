## Title: 5 Things To Consider: Stretching Failover Clustered Instances  Availability Groups to Azure
## Abstract:
### Dealing with SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Groups for local high availability is already complicated with a lot of the external dependencies such as the network and the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC.) But it becomes even more complicated when you stretch it out for disaster recovery to Microsoft Azure. In this session, learn the five (5) things that you need to consider when you implement SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group for disaster recovery into Microsoft Azure. We will cover how Active Directory, DNS, WSFC heartbeat and quorum configuration affects deployments of SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group in a disaster recovery site and how to properly configure a client application for connectivity.
