## Speaker: Stacy Vicknair
## Title: The Game Master's Guide to People Management
## Abstract:
### The dust settles from the massive blow dealt by Erin's quick and, in your opinion, very creative thinking. A monster has been looming over your crew for weeks and it’s now on its last legs. All eyes make their way across the table and over to Jim, who is eager to roll the dice and deal the final blow. A final few clicks from the conference room mouse and the beast is felled. The room erupts in celebration as Jim logs into the new environment, spun up entirely by their efforts and investments in “Infrastructure as Code”.

As much as some might want to draw a line between work and play, there is much that they can have in common. In this session we'll take a look at what we, as people managers, can learn from role playing games and the relationship that evolves between a game master and their players. We'll talk about identifying what motivates our team members and tools and strategies we can employ to create an environment that keeps them challenged, interested, and engaged.
