## Title: Unexplored Features of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Every new version of SQL Server adds new features, some of these features are rarely talked about. Join me in this practical session to learn about some of the uncommon but useful features and data types of SQL Server.
We will start with exploring the hierarchyid, geometry and geography data types of SQL Server. We will look at the Temp tables and find a way to cache Temp tables for a better performance. We will cover sparse, rowversion columns and finish the session by showing a way to remove ORM from web applications by using JSON functions of SQL Server.
