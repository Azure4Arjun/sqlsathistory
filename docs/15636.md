## Title: What exactly is big data and why should I care?
## Abstract:
### You may understand what a data warehouse is, but what is big data?  And why should I care about it?  How will it help me?  I’ll talk about the things to look at to understand if you have big data, and cover those buzz words you may have heard but don’t know what they mean (data scientist, Hadoop, Internet of Things, data lake, modern data warehouse).  I’ll also give examples of how big data is making companies make better business decisions.
