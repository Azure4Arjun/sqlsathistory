## Title: Machine Learning for IoT - Unpacking the blackbox
## Abstract:
### Devices from the IoT realm generate data in a rate and magnitude that make it practically impossible to retrieve valuable information without support of adequate AI engines. Although being one among many solutions available, Azure ML has proved to be a great balance between flexibility, usability and affordable price. But how does Azure ML compare with the other ML providers? How to choose the appropriate algorithm? Do you understand the key performance indicators and how to improve the quality of your models?
This session is about managing and understanding IoT data. Check this out and see how Azure Machine Learning could support real life problems in building IoT solutions.
