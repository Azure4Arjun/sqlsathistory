## Title: Embedding PowerApps into a Power BI Dashboard
## Abstract:
### PowerApps are a relatively new technology released within the Azure stack.  Its primary focus is to empower technical or non-technical developers to create quick and simple custom apps.  They can be used as standalone apps or embedded within websites/mobile apps.  On the other hand, Power BI is now a mature product and needs little introduction.

What if we could use PowerApps and Power BI together?  Can we embed a PowerApp into a Dashboard and give the end user the ability to write back data to a visual?  Come along to my session to find out.

The 1-hour session includes other technologies such as Azure SQL Database, Common Data Service (CDS) and Flow.  In particular, I will demonstrate how you integrate these technologies with PowerApps and Power BI.  Whilst all levels of expertise are welcome, users require prior knowledge of Power BI Dashboards and PowerApps.
