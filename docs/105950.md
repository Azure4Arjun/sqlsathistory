## Title: AWS vs. Azure: What's The Difference For A DBA?
## Abstract:
### Everyone has strong opinions and reactions to which cloud database platform companies should be using but how different are they, really?  What features does one cloud provider support that the other might not?  How will normal DBA activities, such as backups and restores, change depending on the cloud provider your company uses?  Join me in this session as I share my migration stories and discuss the results of my research about how AWS and Azure are different and how many of my daily tasks and tools changed as our company migrated to AWS.  Come and listen as I share what I have learned on this journey from on-premises to the cloud.  Join me and find out which platform I would use.
