## Title: Dissecting the Data Flow: Exploring SSIS Transformations, Memory and the Pipeline
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integrations Services is a robust product, with lots of different options available to the ETL developer. One of the main components in SSIS is the Data Flow task. For someone new to SSIS, it can be daunting to be assigned a project to extract data from a source, transform it and then load it into its intended destination. What components do I use? Why pick one over another? Even if you are new to SSIS, it's good to have an understanding of what's going on under the hood when a data flow task is run. Come to this session to learn what non blocking, semi blocking and fully blocking transformations are. We'll explore how SSIS creates and manages memory buffers. You'll leave with a better understanding of how certain tasks and transformations can affect your packageâ€™s performance.
