## Speaker: Rob Kraft
## Title: SQL Server Security - All Things Considered
## Abstract:
### Join me for a discussion of security risks in SQL Server and the tools and processes we have to mitigate those risks.   The relationship of security to authentication, encryption, SQL Injection, SQL Browser, backups, auditing, compliance, data access layers, and more will be covered in brief.   Attendees will leave this session knowing the pros and cons of different logon methods,  and hopefully new techniques to reduce the attack surface of the SQL Servers they manage.
