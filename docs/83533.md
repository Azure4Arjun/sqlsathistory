## Title: Azure for SQL Server Professionals - Get your head in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Lift and shift is an utopia many IT professionals have about moving on-prem resources to the cloud. The truth is we must understand how the cloud works so we adjust, design accordingly and deliver to expectations. As SQL DBAs we have options. We can choose between IaaS or PaaS, between SQL in a VM or SQL DB, NoSQL options, Azure Data Warehouse some more. In this session we will dive into these options and understand some key points on the platform through some demos.
