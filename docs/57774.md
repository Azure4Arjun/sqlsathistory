## Title: Designing a Modern DW + Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Join us for a discussion of strategies and architecture options for implementing a modern data warehousing environment.Â  We will explore advantages of augmenting an existing data warehouse investment with a data lake, and ideas for organizing the data lake for optimal data retrieval. We will also look at situations when federated queries are appropriate for employing data virtualization, and how federated queries work with SQL Server, Azure SQL DW, Azure Data Lake, and/or Azure Blob Storage. This is an intermediate session suitable for attendees who are familiar with data warehousing fundamentals.
