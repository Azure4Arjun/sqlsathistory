## Title: Availablity Groups in SQL 2016 and beyond: Faster, Higher, Stronger
## Abstract:
### Always On Availability Groups have become the preferred HA/DR solution within SQL Server. Starting with SQL Server 2016, a number of enhancements have been made to make AGs faster, have better up time, and be more resilient.    We will cover all the recent changes in Availability Groups (direct seeding, multiple automatic failover replicas, distributed AGs, load balanced secondaries, etc) and look at how they can be leveraged to create more robust HA/DR solutions.
