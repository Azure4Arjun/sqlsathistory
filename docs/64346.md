## Speaker: John Harp
## Title: Crappy Queries: A Beginner's Guide to Hunting in the Field
## Abstract:
### When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. But what if you had two hammers? Or three? Let John add just a couple of native tools to your belt in this session, and you should have a better starting ability to distinguish a criminally crappy query from an innocent one, a perpetrator from a victim. We'll delve into some older technology like SQL tracing, its much newer, hotter sibling Extended Events, and even leverage some native DMVs in a hunt to pin down a few T-SQL malefactors.
