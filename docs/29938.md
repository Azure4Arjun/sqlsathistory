## Title: Ask Why My Query So Slow?
## Abstract:
### I will elaborate on  the following topics in detail by presenting real-world code examples, why they are inefficient and what is the solution.
Configuration:
1.	RAM (Memory)
2.	RAID (IO)
3.	Concurrency – 
•	Dirty Read
•	Phantom Read
•	Non-repeatable Read
•	Blocking
Code:
1.	inline function (and expression)
2.	select * 
3.	compiled to incorrect plan  
4.	recompile plan 
5.	union (union all)
6.	missing  join 
7.	type implicit conversion  
8.	unfiltered delete (truncate)
9.	like operator (and execution plan and index)
10.	missing, unused, redundant indexes 
11.	query hint 
12.	database version compatibility 
13.	locking, blocking (isolation level)
14.	not in, in, exists, not exists 
15.	schema naming convention
