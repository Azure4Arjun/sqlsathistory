## Speaker: Kyle Walker
## Title: SSRS Subscriptions
## Abstract:
### Join Kyle's session on SSRS subscriptions! In this session, you will get a chance to see some real world subscription requests and how to implement them. Some requests, which are common across a lot of businesses, fall outside of the functionality of Reporting Services so this session will also require some knowledge of SSIS.
