## Title: Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!
## Abstract:
### Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.
