## Speaker: Steve Hendricks
## Title: Ace the Interview
## Abstract:
### Job Search: Too often what separates us from the job we want is that we don't do HOW to interview.  Sadly, if you don't know how to do something, you will probably not do it well.  This session is designed to give you the inside track on what employers are looking for and includes an interactive hands-on portion where you can hone your interviewing skills.
