## Title: What, Why, and How of Cloud Migrations
## Abstract:
### IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Storage, Hybrid etc. etc.  are you confused?  If you are, that’s ok.  In this session I explore the different capabilities that are available to migrate on-prem workloads to the cloud.  I discuss what workloads are more conducive to a cloud migration and how you can determine the ‘low hanging fruit’.  I will walk you through a framework I developed to examine all the dependencies that you need to understand and evaluate before migrating to the cloud.  I will also lead you through various migration options and architectures that are being commonly deployed in the cloud.
