## Title: Azure Machine Learning - Building New Value From Old Data
## Abstract:
### We have lots and lots of data. Typically when it comes to data analysis we have to know what our measures of success are before we design our BI. These are typically manifested by competency, or domain driven KPI's but what if those metrics don't actually measure success at all?

In this talk we will be discussing how to leverage azure machine learning to answer questions in your organization about success and how to find the KPI's that really matter and drive results.
