## Title: Is the Job of a DBA, just a DBA?
## Abstract:
### As I enter into the World of Database Administration I found that I was not only concerned about the data within the Database but with other technologies that support the database. Where is the data stored and who is responsible for that device? How will that be accessed and what level of access should they be granted. What host will the Instance be installed and who is responsible for that?
These question lead to other question that we don’t have control so therefore we must find a way too intelligently and effectively communicate.  

Let’s look at some of the ways to enhance the communication between administrative groups outside of the Database realm.
Is the Operating System and Network that supports the database functioning as expected?
Is the storage device providing us with optimal throughput?
Do we have enough space to continue to grow our data and Log files?
How can this be evaluated and effectively communicated to administrators that are not DBA’s?
