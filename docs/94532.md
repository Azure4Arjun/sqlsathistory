## Title: "Why is My Drive Full?" Understanding SQL Backups - Even if you are not responsible for Backups
## Abstract:
### This session will provide an introduction to understanding and configuring  SQL Server backups. It will explain Data files, Transaction Log files, Recover Models, Backup Types as well as show multiple examples of Full, Differential and Transaction Log backups and restores. We will also cover the easiest way to schedule backups and to remove the old backup files.

You will also be shown answers to the following questions?
    What are the different types of Backups?
    What does the Recovery Model setting do?
    Are there conflicting backups happening? 
    Why are the log (ldf) files so big?
    How do I clear space from the log files? 
    How do I shrink the log files?

This is a good introduction, if you need to learn how to backup SQL, want to know more about backups or occasionally need to troubleshoot backup issues.
