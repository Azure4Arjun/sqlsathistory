## Title: High Availability of SQL  in the context of SLA
## Abstract:
### If SQL Server is heart of our environment, his health should be very important, right? If SQL Server is important, his availability for our businesses (internal and external) is important to. For our customers doesn't matter where data are stored, how are stored and what we do with those data. Especially for our managers. The data must be available on demand, on time, at he moment of request. High Availability is our responsibility. How we can prepare our environment for HA? How HA is connected for with SLA? And why Service Level Agreement are important for us? In this session I want to discuss about HA options for SQL Server (2008, 2012), about our different customers, and about Service Level Agreement (formal or not).
