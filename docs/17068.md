## Title: Free Tools for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs don't realize it, but a plethora of free tools are available that make managing SQL Server easier and less time consuming.  This session will take a look at a number of these tools and how they can simplify your life as a DBA.  Whether you want to analyze trace data, query plans, or performance counter, or maybe just reduce the possibility of having one of those dreaded "Oops, that was production" moments as a DBA, this session will show you how, and the best part is it's all free.
