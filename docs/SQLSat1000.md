# SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1000)
Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 19:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Ben Weissman
## Title: SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything
## Abstract:
### In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?

# Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1000)
Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 19:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time. This tool can be used to automate complex processes, facilitate reporting on an unknown number of targets, or perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming to develop.

This is an often misunderstood tool that is underused in areas where it can provide immense value or abused by applications that it was never intended for. Well-written dynamic SQL can solve seemingly impossible problems while being easy to read and understand.

Applications that will be demonstrated include: mapping database relationships, schema searching, generating large volumes of TSQL, and much more. Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it!

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: 10 Cloudy Questions to Ask Before Migrating Your SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Cloud adoption of database-related services continues to accelerate, but the choices for which service to select – IaaS, DBaaS, and PaaS – all impact the features available to your applications. Selecting a service is a critical first step in the migration process, and selecting poorly can lead to cost overruns and significant time spent going down the wrong path. The questions you do not ask or consider prior to a migration can make or break your cloud experience. The most important ten questions to answer, such as your availability requirements, database-level dependencies, migration strategies, and other critical concerns, will all be discussed so that you are ready to move to the cloud with confidence in your platform of choice.

# Execution plans ... where do I start?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1000)
Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 19:00:00 - Track: Tuning and Optimization
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution plans ... where do I start?
## Abstract:
### SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That’s where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it’s slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

# Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1000)
Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 19:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance
## Abstract:
### Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.

## Speaker: Patrick Gallucci
## Title: Build a Complete Azure Data Platform in 1 Hour
## Abstract:
### Migrating Data and Analytic workloads to Azure gives organizations the ability to innovate faster with the Azure Data Platform. To unlock the potential, it typically takes months to architect, engineer, and deploy a Modern Data and Analytics Platform in Azure. Even with a prescriptive approach for cloud adoption, many organizations are not equipped to take on the full scope of responsibility required to leverage the all-up capabilities they have acquired as a result of the project.
Patrick Gallucci will share a service delivery approach that helps organizations move large and small data platforms to Azure. He will show you how to leverage proven cloud adoption methodologies, tools, resources, and best practices to enable your organization to simplify and accelerate their move to the cloud.

## Speaker: Erin Dempster
## Title: Navigating Row Level Security
## Abstract:
### New to SQL Server 2016 (okay, it's a few years old already, but it still feels new) is Row Level Security, which allows database developers and architects to effectively lock down tables, giving users access to a defined subset of data in the table.  It sounds easy enough, but there are a number of design considerations and pitfalls to be aware of.  This session will work through a few demos to implement RLS and dive into those pitfalls that need to be avoided.  For anyone considering implementing Row Level Security or have tried but have run into issues, this should be a session you want to attend.

## Speaker: Michael McKinley
## Title: Basic Data Modeling for BI Reporting
## Abstract:
### We all start using business intelligence tools by using a single dataset, like a flat file.  Then, we hit a plateau in our learning curve, or we add a second flat file into our BI product, and we get incorrect results.  One reason is that we haven't modeled our solution correctly.

In order to move to the next level of our journey along the BI learning curve, we need to understand how a tool like Power BI works.  Only then will we understand why we design our data models the way we do.

In this session, we will review how tools like Power BI work under the covers and how that impacts the way we construct our data models.  This is an introductory level course, so we will not get too technical, just enough to get us to the next level and moving back up that learning curve!

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: From Stutterer to Speaker: Overcoming Your Fears
## Abstract:
### Are you terrified of public speaking? For 37 years of my life, I was too! That paralyzing fear of public communication held me back and kept me taking from taking advantage of career and community opportunities that came my way - and I've heard this story from many. Now, when I speak at community events, I'm often asked how I got into speaking and how I got over my fears of public speaking. In this free-wheeling session I'll tell you the tips and tricks that I took to heart to go from a kid in speech therapy to somebody that volunteers to speak in front of people and actually enjoys it. Most importantly, I'll talk about how improved personal and public communication can give your career a massive boost in this time of rapid growth in the data professional realm. I sincerely hope this session helps encourage people to overcome their fears of public and small group speaking - or that you at least enjoy making fun of pictures of 6-year-old me in speech therapy headphones!

Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 19:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: The ins and outs of securing SQL Server traffic
## Abstract:
### We are frequently hearing of an enterprise-size business being hacked, data being stolen, or data being exploited. Data security has always been important, but it should not be taken for granted. Data is information, and one of the greatest assets to a business, and when it is compromised, things go south quickly.

While there are multiple levels of security (securing data at rest, data in traffic, etc.), this session will focus on securing data that is on the move; ie., securing traffic between a client and server. We'll discuss and look at two solutions: Certificates and IPsec, exploring them in detail, outlining the pros and cons of each, how to set up and configure them, and when to use what.
