## Title: SSIS Deployment and Configuration
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to a new way of deploying SSIS projects and packages and configuring them at run time.  These new features include the project deployment model and the Integration Services Catalog.  
This session will discuss the details of these features including:
•	Configuring package properties using SSIS Parameters
•	Project level connection managers
•	Deployment to the Integration Services Catalog
•	Creating environments and using environment variables
•	Executing packages in different environments
Come and see how easy it is to deploy and configure the same SSIS packages to run in multiple environments.
