## Title: SSIS: Lookup Between the Lines
## Abstract:
### This session covers some interesting ways to work with data iand SQL in ETL, and solve some common problems
1. Using Range Predicates in a Lookup Transform (Using Between and IN type lookups can give you VERY sophisticated matching techniques you may not have known were available in SSIS), 
2. Using stored procs and parameters in a lookup
3. Having a named parameter to match on in an OleDB lookup.
