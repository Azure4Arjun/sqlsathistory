## Title: Working with SSRS Data-Driven Subscriptions 
## Abstract:
### SSRS Subscriptions are one of the great things within SSRS to automate delivery of reports.  However, one of the more powerful methods of further enhancing this automation is by use of data-driven subscriptions.  Data-driven subscriptions allow us to determine at run time what subscribers and other parameters can be used for automating generating these reports.

We'll begin with a quick overview of what the more familiar subscription functionality is and then quickly jump into what data-driven subscriptions provide for us.  We'll then demonstrate from beginning to end how to implement data-driven-subscriptions.  Lastly, we'll wrap up with any tips and tricks to enhance our process.
