## Title: A Practical Starter Guide to SQL Notebooks
## Abstract:
### Have you been hearing about SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio but haven't worked with them yet? Or have you played around with notebooks but not been able to figure out how to make them work for you?

Let's jump into SQL Notebooks together as we figure out how we can use them in our day-to-day work! We will start by looking at the different options that are available to us in SQL Notebooks. Then we will examine real world scenarios and create notebooks for them. Finally, we will learn how we can share the notebooks with our coworkers.

When you leave, you will have the practical knowledge and comfort level to use SQL Notebooks in your day-to-day work.
