## Title: The Elephant in the Room (Hadoop for DBAs)
## Abstract:
### The rapidly evolving worlds of cloud and big data are producing a wide variety of new computing and storage platforms beyond the relational paradigm.  This includes Not-Only SQL (noSQL) data stores, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, to distributed data management and computation ecosystems such as Hadoop.  

This session will explore the key technology gaps and drivers behind this shift, and examine the pros and cons of various tools and approaches.

This will encompass hands-on demonstrations, real world applications and how best to leverage these new platforms in conjunction with SQL Server.
