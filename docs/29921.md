## Title: Data Sharding in OLTP Systems
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest challenges for modern OLTP Systems is the amount of data needed to be collected and processed. Business requirements, industry standards and regulations require systems to retain enormous amount of information. Offline data archiving is not often an option especially with the hosted solutions - customers expect old data to be available on the fly. Keeping all data in the single instance of SQL Server is the most expensive option from hardware cost and management standpoints. 

This session demonstrates several data sharding techniques that can be used to partition the data across multiple database servers focusing on the task of separating production and historical data in OLTP systems
