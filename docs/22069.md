## Title: Extend the Reach of Power BI with Easy Data Integration
## Abstract:
### In this session we will show you how to extend the reach of Power BI using easy to use tools from the Dell Information Management Group to connect to Relational, NoSQL and Cloud Sources.  Using standard Ansi SQL means that you can talk across all of these platforms with one language and one tool to enable data to be provisioned in a secure collaboration environment for your end users.
