How SharePlex Replicates from Oracle to SQL Server and Eight Other Targets

Replicate from Oracle to a more economical and potentially easier-to-manage platform like SQL Server and experience less frustration when support is required. Offloading database activities to a SQL Server replica will leave more processing power and faster response times for your Oracle users. Users on the SQL Server target will enjoy near-real-time data on an instance that is tuned specifically for the purpose of reporting, analytics and other database activities while the Oracle production system remains tuned for online transaction processing (OLTP). In addition, SharePlex can be used to completely migrate an Oracle database to SQL Server without taking users offline during the migration process. A SQL Server target replica could be used to accomplish archiving or serve as a data warehouse
