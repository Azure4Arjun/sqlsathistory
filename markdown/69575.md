## Title: Architecting a Data Lake to Modernize Your Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### This full-day session will focus on principles for designing and implementing a data lake. There will be a mix of concepts, lessons learned, and technical implementation details. During the session we will build a data lake from the ground up, populate it, organize it, secure it, integrate it with a data warehouse via logical constructs, and query the data. You will leave this session with an understanding of the benefits and challenges of a multi-platform analytics/DW/BI environment, as well as recommendations for how to get started.

Target audience:

Technologists who are considering using a data lake. No data lake experience is required. However, familiarity with SQL Server and data warehousing is suggested, as the scenarios discussed will primarily focus on extending functionality and improving agility for an existing data warehouse.

You will learn in this session:

    Scenarios and use cases for expanding an analytics/DW/BI environment into a multi-platform environment
