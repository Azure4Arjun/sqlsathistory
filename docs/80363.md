## Speaker: Jes Schultz
## Title: Busy is a Four-Letter Word
## Abstract:
### If I ask you, "How are you?", is your default answer, "I'm so busy!"? Why do we measure our worth by how much we are doing, rather than by the value of what we do?  Are we busy doing the truly important things that will bring lasting happiness? What does this have to do with a technical conference? Join Jes as she shares with you how she, too, was too busy for too long, but is learning how to do less, more productive, and have bigger impact.
