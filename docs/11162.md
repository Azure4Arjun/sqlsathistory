## Title: Your Free Tools Swiss-Knife for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A lot like fancy gadgets but those do not come for cheap and sometimes we do not even need them and you do not need expensive 3rd party tools to do many tasks with SQL server.

I want to share with you my Swiss-knife of free tools that I use almost daily to work with SQL server. From SQL Nexus , PAL,Qure Analyzer, PSSDiag , and more ;some help with productivity and some cut the time needed to troubleshoot an issue.
