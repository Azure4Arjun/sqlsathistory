## Speaker: Dave Pettengill
## Title: Heart to Heart with Business Users
## Abstract:
### Now days the technician spends more and more of their time conversing with non-technical business users. The problem is, we speak different languages. This results in confusion, frustration and the impression that IT is difficult to work with. This discussion will focus on how to better communicate with business users to provide products and solutions that meet their needs, get them to understand the issues in providing those products and helping the business user to expand their thinking beyond the ordinary.
