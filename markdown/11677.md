## Speaker: Chris Schmidt
## Title: SSAS, MD.: Tuning your cubes for fast processing and faster queries
## Abstract:
### Do you have an Analysis Services Multidimensional cube that isn't working right? Is it slow and non-performing? Does it take a REALLY long time to process? In this session, we'll review some of the best practices that you can put against your SSAS cube to get it running at peak efficiency. We'll discuss how to optimize dimension processing and why attribute relationships are so important, and what makes distinct count measure groups special. We'll also discuss why SSAS has 2 engines under the covers, and how you can use this knowledge to performance tune your cube to address the right bottleneck.
