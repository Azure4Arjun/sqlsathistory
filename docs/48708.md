## Title: Bashboard Delight with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Delivering eye-catching insight has now become almost ludicrously easy. You just fire up Power BI and …
Wait a second. Yes it is has never been easier to add the “wow” factor to presentations based on data. However there are still techniques, tricks and traps that you need to know if you are going to leave your audience impressed with your insights rather than drowning in your data.
This session takes you through the use and limitations of all the visualizations that come out-of-the-box with Power BI, as well as a quick tour of many of the custom visuals that are now available. You will see which type of delivery is best suited to which kind of data. You will also learn how best to structure and adapt the Power BI data model so that it can feed into the different visualizations for maximum effect.
