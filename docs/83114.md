## Speaker: Tobias Koprowski
## Title: SQL Security in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Our data should be secure. And our environment too. What we can do for maximum security in a hybrid environment, where SQL Server exists in two forms: premise and cloud. How to organize our job, how to control our data if we use Windows Azure SQL Database - The Cloud Database. Physical security, policy-based management, auditing, encryption, federation, access and authorization. All of those subjects will be covered in my session.
