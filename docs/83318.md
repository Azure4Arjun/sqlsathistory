## Title: Create a rich no-code model driven app using PowerApps
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has been hard at work converging multiple business application platforms, including PowerApps, XRM/Dynamics CRM/CE, and the Common Data Service, enabling you to create rich, complex, and extensible apps that span devices with little or no code. In this session we will create a model-driven app with no code that includes the data model, user interface, visualizations, and logic. This is an introductory session and is for anyone who has used line of business applications and can work with Excel or Access.
