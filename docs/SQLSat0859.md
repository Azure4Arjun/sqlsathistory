## Speaker: Paul LaGrone
## Title: 2017 SSIS Scale Out for HA/DR ETL
## Abstract:
### 2016 SSIS packages can access data anywhere throughout the network, but normally run on the server they are deployed on. And if something terrible happens to that server, the manual setup of the SSISDB can be time consuming. With 2017, SSIS packages can be deployed once and run on several servers, even simultaneously. This session will teach you how to set up 2017 SSIS Scale Out packages so that your SSIS packages can now be in a Highly Available and Disaster Recovery environment.

# Constraints are the Key (to Data Integrity)

Event Date: 23-03-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andy Warren
## Title: Constraints are the Key (to Data Integrity)
## Abstract:
### This session is designed to introduce you or to re-engage your interest in all the options we have for setting constraints in a database. From datatypes to nulls to checks, defaults, foreign keys, and triggers we have a LOT of options, so it's important to know the options and also have a bit of a professional philosophy on when to use each of them - we will do a brief look at each of them. We'll talk about why getting them right on day 1 is so important, how to add them to existing tables (the syntax is the least interesting part!), and some patterns and anti-patterns you can look for when you get to the office on Monday.  Constraints aren't glamorous, but they matter, and they require an advocate - you! A good session for DBA's, developers, and yes, even managers.

# “Past, Present and Future of the Data Profession"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#859---Tampa-2019)
Event Date: 23-03-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Frank Quintana
## Title: “Past, Present and Future of the Data Profession"
## Abstract:
### In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we forgot that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom. 
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? What is a Data Engineer? What is a Data Analyst? Which skills do we need?

# Storytelling for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#859---Tampa-2019)
Event Date: 23-03-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Jen Underwood
## Title: Storytelling for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
## Abstract:
### Storytelling and depiction of information has existed for hundreds of years in various forms and formats. In today’s era of artificial intelligence and machine-assisted analytics, accurately interpreting and effectively communicating findings is becoming a crucial skill to bridge the growing data literacy gap. To help decision makers get the most value from analytics projects to drive better outcomes, you need to help them make sense of the results. 

Machine learning and advanced analytics can be difficult to understand and explain. Describing the problem, the model, the relationships among variables and the findings are often subtle, surprising and technically complex. Effectively translating quantitative insights and telling a compelling story requires planning, compelling design, and visualization choices. Successful analytical communicators  use the entire process to communicate with stakeholders. Don't miss this fun demo-packed educational session.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

# Accessibility Concerns of Reporting Style with Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#859---Tampa-2019)
Event Date: 23-03-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Accessibility Concerns of Reporting Style with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers. Reports combine tables with charts, KPIs and more. There is a lot to be concerned about when designing reports to provide information to your audience. Today, your company can face lawsuits if your reports are not accessible to all users.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation. Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty. It is about grabbing your audience's attention. It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce accessibility problems that limit who can receive your message, your data. This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of accessibility concerns to insure access to your results by all consumers of your report.  (Note: Accessibility is governed through the guidelines of the American Disabilities Act)
