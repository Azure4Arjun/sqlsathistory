Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is applicable to Excel 2007, 2010 and 2013.
