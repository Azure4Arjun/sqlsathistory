## Title: Data Driven: finding value in the digital maze
## Abstract:
### No one needs to be convinced that data is valuable. But trying to understand where to look for value in your data and what to focus on is challenging. We try to give meaningful context to terminology such as big data, digital disruption, 4th industrial revolution, etc.

This is a non-technical session that will give an overview of how your data landscape is changing and what you need to be aware of  to derive value from data.
