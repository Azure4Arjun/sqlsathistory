## Title: Processing Flat Files with SSIS
## Abstract:
### When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. Youâ€™ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats.
