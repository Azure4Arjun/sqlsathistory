## Title: Temporal Tables in SQL Server 2016 and 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduced the concept of a system-versioned temporal table. Further enhancements were added in SQL 2017. This is a type of user table that is designed to keep a complete history of all data changes to facilitate easy point-in-time analysis. In this session we will cover the basics of the internals of how temporal tables work, how to create them and their wide variety of use cases from auditing, to trend analysis and even recovery from data corruption.
