## Title: X-ray Vision For SQL Server Error Logs
## Abstract:
### In this session we explore the full potential of the SQL Server Error Log.   The error log is painful to sift through at best, so we turn to Business Intelligence to provide us with an insightful 30,000 view of the error log, and will be amazed at what we can see !We will cover how to extract the error log into a SQL Server database, transform this into a dimensional model where we can apply powerful Analytics and Time Intelligence, and provide insightful visualisations of our errors.   The demonstration will use the SQL Server 2012 Sharepoint platform to demonstrate the pillars of Business Intelligence can be used to benefit DBA's specifically.
