## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Failover Clustering with Windows Server 2008
## Abstract:
### Forget a good portion of everything you know about clustering - Windows Server 2008 changes the game. Come see how the changes and improvements affect clustered SQL Server deployments. In addition to Windows, both SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 will also be discussed. The focus will be on SQL Server 2008 and how its changes to the setup, upgrade, and patching processes (among other things) impact the configuration and administration of a clustered SQL Server 2008 instance. Live demos will be shown, and one copy of Allanâ€™s new book, Pro SQL Server 2008 Failover Clustering, will be given away.
