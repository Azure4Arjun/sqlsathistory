## Title: Blue Collar SQL Tricks - Make Standard Edition Work for you.
## Abstract:
### You want Enterprise Edition of SQL Server? Not gonna happen!  When we are limited by having just the Standard version we have to dig into our “Blue Collar” roots, we need to become more creative and squeeze every penny it has to offer out of it.

In this session, we will review some of the limitations that Standard has.  Then review items such as basic normalization and  High Availability options available to Standard.   You will also learn Blue Collar techniques to implement partitioning using techniques like as indexed views and partitioned views.

Let’s dig in and learn to make use of all we have until we beg our bosses enough to get Enterprise Edition!
