## Title: Woodworks on Azure ML Workbench
## Abstract:
### As an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution Azure ML services helps data scientists prepare data, develop experiments, and deploy models at cloud scale. Azure ML Workbench is, as a part of it, a desktop application plus command-line tools offering access to the services. As such you can use it to develop ML-solutions for the cloud on premises. It integrates with many IDEs, Jupyter Notebooks, aso. 

We will go through two experiments to classify raw data and image data using PYTHON and the Azure ML stack.
