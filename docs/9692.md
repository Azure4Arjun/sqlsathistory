## Title: Rapid Data Integration using SharePoint Business Connectivity Services
## Abstract:
### Anthony Obi – Performing CRUD operations against SQL data sources using SharePoint Business Connectivity Services.Many organizations see SharePoint as yet another silo of information that can only access data stored in its Lists and Libraries. In this session, Anthony will review working with external SQL data from within SharePoint using Business Connectivity Services (BCS). He will cover the basic fundamentals required to perform ‘CRUD’ (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations against external SQL Databases, whilst also exploring a variety of SharePoint features available through a series of real time demonstrations. Finally, Anthony will attempt to highlight key points/comparisons to look out for when attempting to use in real world scenarios.
