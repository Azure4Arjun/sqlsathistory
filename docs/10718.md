## Speaker: Brent McCracken
## Title: SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### Since November 2013, Kiwibank has had SQL Server 2014 running live in Production, despite it only going RTM in April 2014. This session will go over the pros and cons of deploying a pre-release version and also cover some of the things that we did do, didn't do and couldn't do. This deployment is fully supported by Microsoft and I'll share some of the background info on that too. This session will be a beginner to intermediate with some advanced aspects as well.
