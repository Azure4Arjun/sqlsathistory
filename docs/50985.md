## Title: Boosting DWH-Performance with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 brings the topic "in-memory" to a new level. Not that previous versions did not hold as much as data as possible inside of memory through caching, but now we enter a new era: in-memory row stores, in-memory column stores and compiled stored procedures are different from what we have seen so far. In this session, you will see how you can leverage those new features and how you can come by existing limitations. Come back to office with the knowledge how to boost the performance of your ETL, queries and reports into the new era.
