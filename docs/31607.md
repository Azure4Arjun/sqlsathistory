## Title: SSIS Performance Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Need a fast data integration solution, but don't have the time or budget for heavy performance tuning? Come learn how to maximize your ROI by applying trusted design patterns to your Integration Services packages. We talk about how to set performance expectations, and how to put together a simple framework to record benchmarks for your ETL process. We go over the basics of smart package design, and then look at a number of design patterns for common data warehousing problems, such as Slowly Changing Dimension processing, Range Lookups, and Change Detection.
