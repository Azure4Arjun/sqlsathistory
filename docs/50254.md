## Title: Azure Data and Storage in a Nutshell
## Abstract:
### Azure Data and Storage are one of the main parts of Microsoft Azure. 
It includes many different services like: 
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse (in preview)
- Azure Data Lake Store (in preview)
- Document DB
- Azure Storage (Blobs, Tables , Queues and File Service)
- Azure Search
- Redis Cache

These storage and data services offer different type of data - relational, noSQL, file service, distributed cache etc.
Often when you work on a design of a cloud solution you need to consider the best option to use some of these services, based on the functionality, throughput, data size and price. 
This talk is comparison between these storage by features and price. We will discuss about the best practices to use some of these services. The presentation also compares Azure Data and Storage services with similar features of other public clouds like AWS.
