## Title: Power BI Dataflows - What do you mean it's about storing data?
## Abstract:
### Power BI Dataflows are an emerging technology from Microsoft in the Power BI space (not to be confused with Azure Data Factory Dataflows, of course). Power BI Dataflows are emerging as some features are still in preview. The part that is not clear in the name is that this is not purely and ETL function. Power BI dataflows allow you to store data in Azure Data Lake. Depending on how you configure your solution, you can use the Common Data Model as well. Let's dig in an create a dataflow using native Power BI functionality then we will look at using an existing ADLS as well.
