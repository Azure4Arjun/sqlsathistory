## Title: An Oracle DBA's Survival Guide to SQL Server Database Administration
## Abstract:
### Often times, an Oracle DBA is given the new responsibility of administering SQL Server Instances.   Or, conversely a SQL Server DBA has been given Oracle database instances to manage.   This session provides a general survival guide to assist with the DBA’s journey to the “other-side”.    An overview will be presented on the differences  similarities between Oracle and SQL server in the areas of:  terminology, object structures, memory, storage architecture, back  recovery, basic administration, data transfers, security and performance analysis.   We’ll discuss steps  strategies to help guide you in learning this new database skill set, and also look at common performance analysis tools which can be used across both Oracle and SQL Server databases.   Whether a DBA, developer or manager, this overview will help gain a basic understanding of the key similarities and differences between SQL Server  Oracle.
