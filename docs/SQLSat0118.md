# Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#118-Madison-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 350
## Speaker: Doug Lane
## Title: Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus
## Abstract:
### Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful? 

Lately it hasn't been the same. There's no spark anymore. You've been stuck doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services won't tell you what's wrong, and you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by reminding you how reports perform best, what RS has been trying to tell you (but you haven't been listening), and show you some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. You'll leave knowing more about troubleshooting using the execution log, understanding how to design reports for high performance, how to deal with blank pages, and more.

# You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#118-Madison-2012)
Event Date: 21-04-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 321
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query. If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.

## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous
## Abstract:
### There are many DBCC statements at the disposal of Database Administrators and Developers. Some are used for the greater good; others can wreak havoc in your system. The majority of these commands are informational, but if you’re not careful you can introduce chaos or at worst, lose data you may never find again. In this session we will explore DBCC commands that are useful for the DBA and developer, and cover when to use them and how. Expect demonstrations that provide a practical application of these commands - both documented and not - that database professionals can utilize quickly and easily.

## Title: Free SQL tools for your toolbox
## Abstract:
###   Every SQL developer or DBA should have a fully stocked toolbox that they can turn to in times of need.  SQL Server enjoys a wide variety of support from 3rd party vendors that provide tools to help us peek under the hood and pinpoint issues.  Sometimes we either don't have the budget for everything we would like, or we need something for a one-off project.  In this session we will examine some of the free tools published by members of the SQL community and 3rd party vendors.

## Title: Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility
## Abstract:
### How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.

## Title: Performance Enhancing Laziness
## Abstract:
### Walk-up work. 
New database requests. 
Users running ad-hoc queries with 18 LEFT OUTER JOINS against heaps.
Suprise SQL instances created by vendors without our knowledge crashing around us!
It's enough to drive a lesser DBA crazy-insane.  That's why it's important to take as many steps as you can to simplify, automate, tweak, and tune the tasks you can manage so you have time to deal with those situations you can't control.  In this session Tim will go over many of performance-enhancing methods he's developed over the last dozen years as a DBA for a major healthcare concern and show you how you can give yourself some breathing room to make the difficult seem easy.
