## Title: Death by UDF
## Abstract:
### Using User Defined Functions in your database code is like playing Russian Roulette with 5.97 bullets in the gun!!  There are SOOOOO many ways they can kill you: staggering performance degredation, tempdb allocation issues and bad data!!  Oh, did I mention performance issues??  Those include row-by-row processing under the covers, bad estimates leading to horrible query plans, voiding parallelization in the engine, etc.  In this jam-packed session we will cover all this and also discuss several ways you can get rid of them.
