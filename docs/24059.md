## Title: Processing XML Files into SQL Server using SSIS
## Abstract:
### This talk will show the steps needed to process an XML file for an order entry system.  We will go through the lifecycle of the XML file and how the data is processed so that it is usable for entry in an order entry system.  We will show the different pieces of the XML process and files and how they work together.  We will also show how to dynamically change information as the need arises.
