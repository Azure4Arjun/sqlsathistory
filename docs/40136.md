## Title: You Can Still Analyze Data with T-SQL ... No Really
## Abstract:
### This session will look at a variety of T-SQL functions and techniques that can be used to analyze data. Including demos of CUBE, ROLLUP and the various "window" functions which use the OVER function. These are not the new functions, but they are often underused. With in-memory OLTP on the horizon, relational queries will perform even better. This is the time to brush up on or learn about analyzing data with T-SQL.
