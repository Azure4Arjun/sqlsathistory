## Title: Understand better Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is an extraordinarily powerful engine of relational databases, which lets you achieve high scalability of data platform. For many years SQL Server gains more and more new features and more efficient mechanisms including InMemory or ColumnStore Indexes. However, there is still many companies not using those features and struggling with performance issues, which the root cause turn out the problems with concurrency. 
Let's back to the basis then in order to better understand transaction isolation levels available in SQL Server. On this session we will learn about a concurrency issue, (not)expected behaviours, lost modifications and consider how to cope with them. I will tell what the optimistic and pessimistic concurrency models are, when use it and what tempdb has in common with them. Also, we will see in practice how dangerous (NOLOCK) might be which has being used so passionately by developers.
