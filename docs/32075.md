## Title: Be safe out there: Ship those logs
## Abstract:
### What happens if your hardware fails or your data center loses power? Do you have a Disaster Recovery (DR) plan in place that you can implement quickly? Log shipping allows you to keep copies of your databases closely synced and ready to come online in an emergency. Log shipping also offers options for read-only warm standby databases to reduce load from your production servers, adding additional value to your investment. In this session we'll Log Shipping, how it works, and how it differs from its cousin, Mirroring. We'll discuss practical uses for Log Shipping and work through a demonstration to show you how you can get it up and running in your environment.
