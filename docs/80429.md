## Speaker: Beverly Prohaska
## Title: Innovation or Extinction: Reimagining the Role of IT
## Abstract:
### While nearly every organization believes that they want to capture “innovation” as the silver bullet to survivability and growth, very few have learned the best practices to create an “innovative culture”, and even fewer execute those plans well.  Beverly Prohaska, Consultant and former CIO, presents a model for understanding and initiating a culture that can actually innovate at differing levels.  This discussion will include key definitions, do’s and don’ts, as well as best practices, examples, and observations on Innovation across several large companies.
