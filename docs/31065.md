## Title: XML in SQL Server.  Why bother? 
## Abstract:
### Many of the Developers and DBAs have the XML syndrome.  We can’t blame them because XML document are not simple.  But what most Developers and DBA don’t know is how SQL Server can help you overcome the XML syndrome.  XML is here to say, we will need to save some XML in the database more often than ever.  This session will cover usable scenarios when using Xpath, Xquery the XML type in SQL server and the XSD. We will look at the different tools available in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Visual Studio (VS).  This is the chance to bring the DBA and Developer to the same level in using XML in SQL Server.
