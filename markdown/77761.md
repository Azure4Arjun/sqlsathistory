## Speaker: Michael French
## Title: Consumption Based Architecture
## Abstract:
### Is this a replacement for architectures out there today like Kimball, Inmon, Federated, etc? 
NO! It’s more about creating patterns and designs that focus on putting the data in the hands of the users by leveraging existing architectures.

All data assets, we really want to give our users a single source of the truth. We want them to go to one place to get all their data, that’s the common goal in enterprise data solutions. The problem is not all the data resides in one place, especially with big data, more tech savvy users, the vast amount of data resources available… you can really get data from anywhere. 

Promotes self-service by 
leveraging data assets you already have
increasing your business’ consumable data based on both need and data readiness. 

This is not a data dump but more about getting good data to the right business people at the right time.
