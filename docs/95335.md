## Title: Microsoft/Azure Data Integrations: Factories, Pipelines, and Flows Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Data Integration possibilities have proliferated recently. Some of you may feel dizzy with all the new options and announcements. Its not made easier by similar sounding names sometimes. In this session we'll try and demystify these options by going over the Microsoft (Azure/SQL Server/Power BI) data movement options. That will include Azure Data Factory (Copy/Transform, Mapping Data Flow, Wrangling Data Flow), Azure Databricks, Power BI (Query Editor/M/Power Query, dataflows), and SSIS. We'll dive into the what, when, where, why, and how of each of the options. We'll also demo some of the options.
