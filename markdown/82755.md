## Speaker: Greg Low
## Title: Database on a diet (taming a large database)
## Abstract:
### Greg regularly works with tier-one financial organisations and they all struggle with the size of their databases. It's easy for the size to get out of control. In this session, Greg will describe the techniques he used to reduce an operating 3.6TB database to just over 500GB, while increasing its performance. The session will include a deep dive into compression techniques within SQL Server.
