## Title: Blogging â€“ How to Build and Sustain Top Ranking Blog
## Abstract:
### Expressing yourself is the most common behavior of humans, and blogging has made it easy to express yourself. Just like a letter or book has a structure and formula, blogging also has structure and formula. In this introductory course on blogging, we will go over a few of the basics of blogging and show how to get started with blogging immediately. If you already have a blog, this course will be even more relevant, as it will discuss many of the common questions and issues you face in your blogging routine.
Everybody can write, and everybody can build a blog. But not everyone can make their blog a popular point of reference for their subject matter. Content is king - but a king also has ministers to help, and good content needs help from various aspects of the real world. In this course, we discuss the essential elements to bringing quality content to the masses, making it popular, and monetizing your effort.
