## Title: Google BigQuery ML: Machine Learning with SQL
## Abstract:
### BigQuery is the data warehouse offering from Google Cloud Platform. It also has a powerful and increasingly growing machine learning integration. Using BQML, you can create, train, or import linear regression and classifier models directly into your dataset. You can then make predictions directly using SQL and integrate them into your reporting and dashboards. This session will cover BigQuery ML and a few example applications.
