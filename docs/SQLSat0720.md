## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: Faster SSIS
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

# Querying Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-720)
Event Date: 05-05-2018 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Ron Beatty
## Title: Querying Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### System-versioned temporal tables, first introduced with SQL Server 2016, make it possible to not only query current data, but to also query the data as it was at a particular point in time. First, a temporal table is a type of table where the current version of the data is stored in the temporal table while previous versions of the data are stored in an associated “history” table. Together, the temporal table and its related history table store a full history of the data as it changes over time. Second, the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause is available in SELECT … FROM constructs for querying temporal tables at either a precise moment in time or during a specific period of time with one of four sub-clauses: AS OF, FROM TO, BETWEEN AND, and CONTAINED IN (,). In this presentation, the schema of a temporal table and its corresponding history table will be explored to gain an understanding of how SQL Server stores temporal data. This will be followed with queries demonstrating how and when to us

# Dynamic Data Driven Subscriptions in SSRS Without Enterprise Edition
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-720)
Event Date: 05-05-2018 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Dave Justice
## Title: Dynamic Data Driven Subscriptions in SSRS Without Enterprise Edition
## Abstract:
### Data Driven reports are a powerful Reporting Services feature, but they are only available in the Enterprise Edition.  In this session we're going to dig into the ReportServer database and look at some tables that will allow us to dynamically interact with subscription records and use them to control report output.
  
We will also leverage an SSRS interface to set and update parameters to the subscription tables.  
By using these techniques we can simulate the power of Data Driven Subscriptions without having to have Enterprise Edition.  These techniques can also be used to dynamically configure actual Data Driven Subscriptions and kick them off without access to the SQL Agent engine.  Anyone wanting to extend their SSRS capabilities in creating report automation should attend this session.

# Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-720)
Event Date: 05-05-2018 - Session time: 11:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why is my DBA So Grumpy ... When I Use NOLOCK and Other Query Hints.
## Abstract:
### Most of us have heard that using the NOLOCK hint is not recommended. But why is this? What is it about NOLOCK that sends most DBAs into a tizzy? And how about other hints such as ROWLOCK and RECOMPILE - are they OK to use? Come hear a discussion on why exactly query hints cause problems when used excessively, and watch some demos of NOLOCK craziness in action.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
## Abstract:
### Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: The Anatomy of Select
## Abstract:
### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.

## Title: Source Control and Database Projects - Just Do It
## Abstract:
### If you aren't using database projects you should be and if you aren't using any source control well..... NOW IS THE TIME.  We'll review basic functionality and purpose of both and walk through how they work together.   Let's talk about the type of foundation pieces you need to pay attention to and how to organize this into team and agile work.  Lots of tips and tricks to remove the often experienced headaches that developers have experienced with implementing both of these items.

## Title: Introduction to T-SQL Windowing Functions
## Abstract:
### T-SQL windowing functions can simplify many complex queries. They are the best thing that has happened to the T-SQL language in years, but many database professionals and developers haven’t heard about them. 
They were initially introduced with SQL Server 2005. In 2012, Microsoft added several new functions that let you do things like pull values from different rows without a performance penalty. 
Attend this session to learn how T-SQL windowing functions apply to many real world examples.

## Title: The Ultimate Maintenance Plan
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.

## Title: Python in SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!
