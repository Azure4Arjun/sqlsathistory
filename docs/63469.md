## Title: Data Driven Subscription Reports with SSRS Standard Edition
## Abstract:
### Why not create a report that only sends information if there is data?  Oh, don't have the Enterprise Edition?  I'll show you how with SQL Server Standard Edition.  This demo will walk you through the steps to create these data driven subscriptions.  We'll be using Reporting Services, Integration Services and SQL Agent Jobs to setup and schedule data driven subscriptions.
