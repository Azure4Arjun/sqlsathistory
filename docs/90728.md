## Speaker: Mike Diehl
## Title: Building measures in Power BI (and SQL Server Analysis Services tabular models)
## Abstract:
### In this sessions, we will create measures using the DAX language to support more sophisticated data analytics. 
We'll look at measures for Time Intelligence, such as Year To Date, Previous Year, Year over Year, Moving Annual Total, Rolling Averages. 
We'll also look at measures that handle different dimensional granularities, like Forecast/Budget measures.
The DAX language is designed to look like Excel functions, so if you don't have any Power BI experience, but you are an Excel wizard, you should be able to follow.
