## Title: Building Tabular Analysis Models in Excel 2013
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Excel is the most popular data analysis tool in use. But most users tend to extract data for their analysis and end up with large volume spreadsheets that only they can understand and use. Data Analysts outside the official IT Department need a tool that will allow them to build and browse data models without extensive time lag to stand up traditional SSAS cubes.

Learn how to build SSAS Tabular Models in Excel and Visual Studio. Skirt around Tabular's Parent/Child limitation using DAX Expressions. Use Excel 2013 and SharePoint to build PowerView reports to visualize data trends. Browse a Tabular Model with the DAX Query language.
