## Title: Build your own metadata repository with Powershell
## Abstract:
### Love to run Brent's sp_Blitz and use Ola's MaintenanceSolution, but you have dozens or even hundreds of servers?

Let's build a Powershell script together that will use Remoting to run whatever script you like in parallel on any number of servers. We'll talk about remoting, remoting across domains or even without, how to run scripts in the background and in parallel. I'll show you how to store the results and report on it across all your servers in one go.
