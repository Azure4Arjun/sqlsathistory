## Title: Learn how to build a real-time analytics solution
## Abstract:
### Real time is fundamental for the life of an organization and to the decision making process, therefore, building a real-time analytical model becomes a business need.

In this session we will learn which processes are required to build a real-time analytical model and how to achieve our goal by either using the Lambda or Databricks Delta architecture.

At the end of the session, you will have learned how to ingest, store, prepare and serve the data with Apache Kafka for HDInsight, Azure Data Lake Store Gen 2, Azure Databricks, SQL Data Warehouse and Power BI.
