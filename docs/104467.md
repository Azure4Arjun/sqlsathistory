## Title: Becoming Ever More Intimate with your Indexes
## Abstract:
### Among the many critical and basic concepts to understand within SQL Server comes the concept of indexes. Indexes can be a significant asset or a scary detriment to your environment. During this session we will work through the basics of indexing within SQL Server and then explore some of the more interesting misconceptions I have encountered. 

Do you know how useful your indexes are? Do you know if your indexes might be a bit piggy? Do you know the impact of the indexes on your execution plans? These are just a few of the many questions that I will cover throughout the session as we move quickly through this important topic.
