## Title: For Love or Money, Your I.T. Career
## Abstract:
### • Contracting at the cutting edge of technology is exciting and produces great rates. But what happens when the contract ends and the mortgage payments must continue?
• Maintaining a steady job with a direct deposit salary is comforting. But do you ever feel technologically “stuck” at your job when so many other I.T. professionals are using the latest, most marketable technologies?
