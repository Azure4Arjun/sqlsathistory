## Title: Putting the Development back in SharePoint Develop
## Abstract:
### The goal of this session is to discuss how to structure and plan a Visual Studio solution for a SharePoint development project.  I will discuss some of the coding patterns and practices that we at Envoc have found lead to a high quality product for our clients.  We'll talk about how these patterns and practices allow us to bring a diverse skill set to our project teams due to the minimization of touch points with SharePoint and how automated integration tests help us troubleshoot deployment issues.
