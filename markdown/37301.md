## Title: R For The .NET Developer
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will look at R.  Besides being a pirateâ€™s favorite language (ARRRRRR), R is the most popular language in the world for analytics and data science.  Recently Microsoft purchases Revolution Analytics and has announced that R will be supported in Sql Server 2016.
This session will assume no prior experience with R.  We will look at its syntax and how it compares to Tsql/C#/VB.NET, we will do some basic data science with R, and we talk about some of the hard-learned lessons about using R in your production environment.
