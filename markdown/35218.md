## Title: Securing Sensitive Data with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Databases often contain sensitive data. Without protection this data can fall into the hands of those who have less than honorable intentions. This can be disastrous for not only the business but also the client. 
In this session the encryption and hashing features of SQL Server will be explored as well as some guidance in determining what data should be considered sensitive.
