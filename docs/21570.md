## Title: Under Construction - Power BI Development
## Abstract:
### Power BI is the Self-Service BI offering of Microsoft to all Information Workers out there, but hey: Is there anything for the macro geeks and development folks? This session will have a look on anything you can do or should not do with the Power BI offering in the cloud and on your desktop. What's in it if you want to go beyond the self-service experience? Is there more than create your own cool "M" functions? Let's see in this session, including PowerShell or the new REST-API.
