## Title: Secure SSAS Data Without Tying Yourself in Knots
## Abstract:
### Are you looking for the best way to secure the data in your cube? There are several approaches to applying data security, each with its own pros and cons. Learn about the basic built-in security, and then see approaches for extending this through dynamic security, using security dimensions, and SSAS stored procedures. You'll see examples of each as well as a discussion of when to use which approach.
