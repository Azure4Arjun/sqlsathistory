## Speaker: David Sumlin
## Title: Discover SQL# (SQL CLR library) 
## Abstract:
### Quick overview of the SQL# CLR library where we'll examine a few implementations of some of the functions that I've found useful. Some examples will include string manipulation, file handling, as well as some RegEx usage. There are over 225 procedures and functions, user defined aggregates, and user defined types ... and counting. Come explore some of the interesting problems that SQL# can solve. If you'd like to download and view the CLR library ahead of the presentation, you can get most of the CLR features for free at www.sqlsharp.com.
