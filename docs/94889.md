## Title: Doing Much More With Much Less: The Case for Data Warehouse Automation
## Abstract:
### One of the most pervasive problems in BI today is that data warehouses take too long to build and they are too hard to change. According to TDWI, building a data warehouse is among the most labor-intensive and time-consuming activities of BI development. There are so many moving parts—requirements, source data analysis, data quality, source-target mapping, data acquisition, data transformation logic, ETL design, scheduling, error handling—and getting it right the first time isn’t easy. And when you finally do get it right, something changes...

Join data warehouse automation pioneer WhereScape for this presentation to learn how companies like Nike, Costco, Cornell University, WSU, Daimler, Blue Cross, F5 accelerate warehouse development and change cycles while simultaneously assuring quality and consistency. A key aspect of doing automation right is that it should not get in the way of your developers – it should leverage existing skills, add best practices and generate documentation.
