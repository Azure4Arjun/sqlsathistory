## Title: SQL Server Internals for the Database Developer
## Abstract:
### Understanding the architecture and "internals" of SQL Server can help the developer develop optimal database solutions and troubleshoot performance problems.

In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will cover the practical internals of tables, indexes, transaction logs, query optimization and query execution. Importantly, he will translate how this knowledge can be used in database solution optimization and troubleshooting. This should prove to be a very practical session that all developers, team-leaders and managers should benefit from.
