# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 200
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

# Characteristics of a Great Relational Database

Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 200
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
## Abstract:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness
## Abstract:
### SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL Diagramming techniques.

# Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 200
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks or packages that adhere to a pattern, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.

# Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 500
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
## Abstract:
### So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy. But now you have new requirements that require more advanced data warehouse approaches, like late arriving dimensions, bridge tables, parent child dimensions, and Type 3 or Type 6 slowly changing dimensions (SCD). How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them. (But they deserved it!) Learn how to: create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!

# Olap Security using AS Stored Procedures
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 500
## Speaker: Rob Schoenborn
## Title: Olap Security using AS Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### The demand is increasing for analytical data on the web for dashboards and ad-hoc analysis.  Companies are using this data to provide immediate insight into their business.  Data as a service model requires that users can only access the data they have permission to use.  This session discusses a method of using an Analysis Services Stored Procedure to secure both dimensions and measures in SQL Analysis Services based on Security Authentication from either Performance Point, Share Point or via Excel Web Services (MSMDPUMP) layer.  This mechanism can also be extended to provide custom application security to a SSAS cubes.

## Abstract:
### Originally released with Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework v4, Entity Framework v4 has seen a remarkable evolution in the past year or so. In April, Microsoft released version 4.1. Most notably, there is now great support for Code First development. This talk will delve into the use of Code First in Entity Framework v4.1 and will be very code focused. Developers will learn how they can use the Entity Framework APIs to create applications that use Entity Framework features to access relational databases without the need to use designers to create the model. It is in essence a "code only" approach, which has many benefits, including for testability and long-term evolution of your code.

## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It's TEMPDB Why Should You Care
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right?  It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right?  WRONG.  This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

# Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 400
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

# Getting Started with MDX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#81---Birmingham-2011)
Event Date: 30-07-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Level 100
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
