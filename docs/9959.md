## Speaker: Audrey Hammonds
## Title: Shiny New T-SQL for SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### There has been a lot of fanfare for some of the new features of SQL Server 2012. (AlwaysOn and T-SQL Windowing, I’m looking at you.) But there are a few other shiny little gems hidden between the replicas and frame clauses. The good folks at Microsoft have given T-SQL a few new features and functions, and it’s time to dig in and take a look at what presents they’ve brought us. T-SQL enhancements for 2012, including Result Sets, paging support, metadata discovery, new scalar functions, and the THROW clause for error handling are demonstrated in this session. Shiny!
