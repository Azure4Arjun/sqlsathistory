## Title: Scaling DNA Data Processing with HBase and Hadoop
## Abstract:
### The problem with most academic algorithms is they work well at 5, 10, or even 1000 samples, but when scaling that algorithm to handle tens of thousands of samples they simply fall apart. Ancestry.com faced this challenge after the launch of the Company’s new AncestryDNA test in 2012, which measures 700,000 markers of a users’ DNA to predict ethnicity and provide living cousin matches. To match 700,000 markers in a users’ DNA to every new 700,000 marker sample that enters the database on a weekly basis quickly creates an N-squared problem.   Ancestry.com’s scientists and engineers, ran up against the limitations of the academic algorithm GERMLINE which finds hidden family relationships within a reservoir of DNA.  Because the reference implementation of GERMLINE didn't scale, the teams worked closely together to re-conceptualize the algorithm to make it scale for hundreds of thousands of samples using Hadoop and HBase.
