## Speaker: Tim Hidalgo
## Title: Setting the stage...
## Abstract:
### Making successful deployments consistently is something your executive team wishes could happen.  Sometimes they wish it so hard, that you end up becoming that cowboy that tests everything in production (you know who you are).  Procuring equipment and configuring an environment so that you can have some confidence in your solutions, while not destroying customer data, can be a challenge...especially if you have no plan of attack to hand the people that sign the checks.

In this session we will discuss the need for, the design of, and the way to get a staging environment that can boost your deployment success rate, allow developers to fearlessly code creative solutions, and allow you the DBA to get some sleep knowing they aren't testing in production.
