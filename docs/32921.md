## Speaker: Sid Atkinson
## Title: Analysis Services Performance Monitoring Deepdive
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services performance troubleshooting can appear more art than science - there are no query plans to view for optimization, server configuration documentation can be sparse and getting consistent results with specific query tests does not always yield the results you desire.  How can you know you can meet the SLAs for the user experience?  What is the performance elbow on the number of concurrent users?  Did my new aggregation or partition actually make a difference?

This session will go into details on how to configure a performance monitoring environment, how to gather data and then interpret results into actionable steps, allowing attendees to answer these questions.  Assumes some experience with Analysis Services and MDX
