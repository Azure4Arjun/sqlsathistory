## Title: Machine Learning for Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Machine learning is the science of building predictive models from available data, in order to predict the behavior of new data. It is the practice of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. 

ML is widely used in web search (Google, Bing), recommendation engines (Netflix and Amazon), computational vision (self-driving cars), and natural language processing (Google Translate, auto-grading essays).

This will be a gentle introduction into the world of machine learning. We will cover common techniques such as clustering, supervised vs unsupervised learning, and learning at scale. Finally, we'll explore some examples of machine learning in the real world.
