## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of users constantly coming to you for data?  Would like to be able to quickly and easily enable your uses to go get the data themselves?  Do you simply not have the budget/executive buy in to buy a solution?  In this session you will see how easy this often overlooked and underutilized feature of SQL Server is to use.  This session will start with a quick overview of some reporting examples and will then cover the basics of developing, publishing and using an SSRS report.  It will cover all aspects from connecting to the data source through putting the data on the page to publishing to the report server.  You will learn how you can return to the office and present meaningful data to your end users with minimal time and effort with this very powerful and easy to use tool that can relieve you from data delivery tasks and thrill your end users all at the same time.
