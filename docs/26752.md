## Title: Transaction Log Internals
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is the most important aspect of a SQL Server database.

Join Microsoft Premier Field Engineer Tim Chapman as he discusses data modification internals, write-ahead logging and the inner workings of the SQL Server transaction log.
