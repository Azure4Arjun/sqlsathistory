## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It's TEMPDB Why Should You Care?
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated each time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG TEMPDB is a critical part of your SQL Server instance and needs special attention. In this session Tim Radney will give you insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are the best practices for configuring TEMPDB, what makes TEMPDB so unique, and how to determine if your TEMPDB has a contention issue. Tim will demo creating contention in TEMPDB and explain how to solve this dreadful issue. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.
