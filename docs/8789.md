## Title:  Tracing with Extended Events. - Adios Profiler
## Abstract:
### “Hasta la vista, Profiler.”  – Introduction into Tracing with Extended Events. Focus: historical deadlock analysis 

Extended Events, although in the product since SQL Server 2008 have been known to Insiders as an extremely well performing and flexible Tracing-Framework. Since SQL Server 2012 this important feature, which will replace SQL Trace, is available in SSMS.
In this introductory to advanced session we will also especially have a look at the System Health Session and how it can be used for historical deadlock-analysis right out of the box. („Hasta la vista, Profiler. Hasta la vista Traceflags 1204, 1222“)
