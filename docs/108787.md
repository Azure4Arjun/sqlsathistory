## Title: Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time. This tool can be used to automate complex processes, facilitate reporting on an unknown number of targets, or perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming to develop.

This is an often misunderstood tool that is underused in areas where it can provide immense value or abused by applications that it was never intended for. Well-written dynamic SQL can solve seemingly impossible problems while being easy to read and understand.

Applications that will be demonstrated include: mapping database relationships, schema searching, generating large volumes of TSQL, and much more. Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it!
