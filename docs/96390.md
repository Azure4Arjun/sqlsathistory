## Title: Connecting IoT data with artificial intelligence at scale
## Abstract:
### This talk is about intersection of IoT and artificial intelligence.
IoT solutions to generate more data than traditional systems and users can analyse.
Nowadays, AI enabled software solutions that optimize equipment and process performance for large industrial customers. These solutions use large volumes of real-time, batch data from equipment and processes in real time, and apply AI/ML algorithms to predict failures and anomalies as well as optimize performance.
The concept is explained in the context of Azure IoT and Azure AI platforms.
