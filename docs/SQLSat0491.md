## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: SS2014 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed?
## Abstract:
### Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

## Title: End to End Protection with Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Protecting our data from unauthorized access becomes more and more important all the time, however it has been difficult to ensure sensitive data is encrypted in SQL Server. The new Always Encrypted feature in SQL Server 2016 makes this much simpler for developers and DBAs with a framework for protecting data from the client, across networks, and inside of the database. This new feature allows for limiting access to the data, even from the DBAs and sysadmins that may control the database instance itself. Learn how to implement and use Always Encrypted in your applications.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ Power BI to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

# PowerShell Desired State Configuration from the Trenches
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-491)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: PowerShell Desired State Configuration from the Trenches
## Abstract:
### There are lots of things to consider when configuring systems in your on-premises datacenters with Desired State Configuration depending on what the state of your current environment is, whether or not DSC will be configured to apply and monitor or apply and autocorrect configuration drift, and whether or not you’ll be using push or pull configuration mode. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will share his lessons learned while configuring both physical and virtual production systems in multiple datacenters with DSC during a recent hardware and software refresh cycle. We’ll briefly discuss writing configurations, applying configurations via push and pull mode, and we’ll have a quick discussion about DSC resources. You’ll leave this session with the basic concepts of the end-to-end process. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.

# A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-491)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Shabnam Watson
## Title: A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
## Abstract:
### You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SQL Server Management Studio, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

# Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-491)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
## Abstract:
### Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

# Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-491)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.

## Title: Tone Analysis with HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### People’s sentiments and opinions are written in social networks. There are tweets, Facebook posts, book reviews, forum discussions, and more. These attitudes and feelings are communicated using text, with format depending on the social network. Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters and use hash-tags,; Facebook messages can be longer. This session reviews the different Natural Language Processing, text mining, and data mining techniques you can use for sentiment and tone analysis. Organizations can use the extracted knowledge for brand reputation, market predictions, and automatic learning. We’ll look at, Hadoop, data mining, Microsoft Big Data Hadoop distribution HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning

# Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-491)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.
