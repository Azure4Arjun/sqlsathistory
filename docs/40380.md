## Speaker: Susan Rickman
## Title: DataTypes - What's the Big Deal?
## Abstract:
### Developers and DBAs:  How do you determine what DataType will be required for your database?  Far too often, Database Development teams are pressured into making quick decisions for their database models, usually full of NVarChars and GUIDs, typically based on a suggestion that these datatypes were the only useful datatypes for Web development.  In this session, we will discuss the pro's and con's of the differing datatypes, and arm the Database Developers and DBAs with the analysis necessary to create databases that are easily maintained.
