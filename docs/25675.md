## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Master the Date Dimension Like a Time Lord
## Abstract:
### All data warehouses need a Date dimension to enable analysis by date. Most DW designers will just use a default one provided by the tools, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any Date dimension you want by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary to update the dimension. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll be a Time Lord in your own company!
