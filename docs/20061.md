## Speaker: Merrill Aldrich
## Title: Shoveling Frogs into a Wheelbarrow
## Abstract:
### If you face managing over a hundred, or perhaps thousands, of databases, automation, standards and a "policy-based" mindset are critical. In this session we'll do a walk-through of a rules-based backup and index maintenance solution suitable for zillions of smaller databases, and talk at a high level about features and techniques for multi-server management including monitoring, performance data collection, jobs automation, PowerShell and PBM.
