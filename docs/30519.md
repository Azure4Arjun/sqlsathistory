## Title: Are You Following Your Own Best Practices?
## Abstract:
### Everyone has their own best practices that they try to follow.  But often times we aren’t sure how well we are following our own or industry best practices.  In this session we’ll go into monitoring and managing best practices throughout your environment.  The session will look at how to create a solution using policy based management and other tools to report on your compliance to best practices.
