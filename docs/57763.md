Event Date: 18-02-2017 - Session time: 11:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Greg Low
## Title: What on earth are all the Azure* and Power* services and why would I want them?
## Abstract:
### Don't know your Power Apps from your Power BI, Flow, etc.? In this session Greg will do his best to explain what on earth all the various services are, or at least the ones that he thinks are relevant to data people. Can't promise the final list until nearer the day but the aim at present would be a rapid fire discussion on each of: Power BI, Power Apps, Flow, Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, Azure ML, Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure AD, SQL DB, SQL Data Warehouse, Elastic Database Pools, DocumentDB, Search, Storage, and more. (With demos on some but time wouldn't permit demos on all)
