## Title: Tuning SQL Code using Logical Equivalencies
## Abstract:
### Sometimes even the right indexes won’t get your queries done in decent time.  In this presentation, we will talk about how to help the query processor out by using different logical transformations on queries, so that they can do the same thing faster.   Examples will be used to create “SARGability”, work with “or” logic and use CTEs or temp tables to reduce work.  The goal is to add new techniques to your toolbox to tune code more effectively.
