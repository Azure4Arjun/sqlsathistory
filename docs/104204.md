## Title: Use parameters to add extra flexibility to your Power BI content
## Abstract:
### You're probably applying a lot of steps over and over again every time you create your Power BI report. A waste of time! Apply parameters on the back-end in Power Query, but also in the front-end in your report to make your solutions much more flexible. 

This session will give you examples on where you can use parameters in Power BI and which advantages this will have for you.
