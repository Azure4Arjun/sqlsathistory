## Title: Power up SSRS 2017 with Power BI and other new enhancements
## Abstract:
### Power BI Report Server is a superset of 2 exciting products: Power BI and SSRS 2017. PBIRS provides us a modern, on-premises solution for enterprise reporting and mobile business intelligence. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to develop and publish Power BI reports (.PBIX) in Power BI Report Server, including custom visuals.

Then show you how to work with Mobile Reports, KPIs and Paginated reports. The new Mobile Report publisher produces stunning dashboards that can be viewed on any device (iOS, Android and Windows). Other enhancements include, show/hide download menu, report comments, custom placement of parameters, custom branding your SSRS portal's with your choice of colors and logo.
