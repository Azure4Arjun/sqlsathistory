## Title: Practical PoSh – Design and build larger scripts
## Abstract:
### "Practical Powershell – How to design and build larger scripts"The best Powershell scripts, in my humble opinion, will think like you would and will solve a problem or do a task for you in such a way that you can call the script nine out of ten times with minimal parameters and let it figure out what smart defaults to use.In this session we’ll build a (1) Powershell script to automate one of our many (dba/dev) tasks in order to save us a lot of time.I’ll show you how I design, build, test and debug the bigger scripts and we’ll put in all the bells and whistles that those scripts commonly have. (Like support for  –WhatIf and get-help etc.)
