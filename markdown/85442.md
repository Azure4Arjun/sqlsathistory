## Title: Advanced Indexing for Beginners
## Abstract:
### Indexing is critical to the success of your database, and it’s vital that you understand indexes thoroughly. You should know how they work in different situations, what kind of choices can work for or against you, and how to get the most out of them. This session will dive into index internals and demonstrate what’s going on behind the scenes as queries run. Using practical examples to explain the theory, we will take a journey from the basics through to advanced concepts that become simple when viewed correctly.
