## Title: Database code is application code, so test it!
## Abstract:
### Database code is application code, and deserves to be treated as such.  There, I've said it, now it's time to start living it.  A longtime staple in application development is unit testing, but this practice has made little headway in SQL Server development.  Some better tools will hopefully help change that.  In this session we'll cover some of the basics of unit tests, write a simple unit testing procedure which can be used in nearly any SQL-compliant database, and learn about tSQLt, an open-source unit testing framework for SQL Server.
