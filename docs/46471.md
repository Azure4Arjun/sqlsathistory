## Title: Incremental Load using CDC and Integration Service
## Abstract:
### Incremental Load is one of the main challenges in loading data warehouse. SQL Server Integration Services 2012 comes with Change Data Capture (CDC) components that helps to improve incremental load. CDC can be used with Oracle or SQL Server database.
In this session a brief architecture design for solving incremental load will be discussed and then a real world sample of Incremental will be implemented through a demo with CDC components of SSIS 2012.
