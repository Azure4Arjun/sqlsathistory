## Title: Node.js for Microsoft SQLServer Nerds
## Abstract:
### This session is to all SQL Server and Windows Azure developers, who want to build sclabble applications using Node.js and MS SQLServer / Windows Azure SQL Database.
Node.js came onto the scene four years ago, offering yet another tool for creating server-side software systems that support scalable Internet applications. 
With the continued support from Microsoft for Nodejs on both Windows and Windows Azure, it is bound to reach great levels. Don't worry if you don't know Node.js - this will not be necessary to understand the session.
