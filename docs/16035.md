## Title: ASP.Net MVC and Workflow Foundation
## Abstract:
### Workflow Foundation is a very powerful part of the .Net Framework that has been mostly ignored by the .Net development community.  The main reason developers don't learn it is because they just have no idea how to apply it to their current architectures.

This presentation focuses on using Workflow Foundation inside of an ASP.Net MVC application with a n-tiered architecture.  We will step through creating a workflow with Workflow Services and then we will see how to use the workflow from an ASP.Net MVC application.
