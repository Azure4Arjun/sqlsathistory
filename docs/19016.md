## Title: Introducing SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, the new SQL Server Data Tools serves as your primary development environment for building applications on top of SQL Server. SSDT plugs in to Visual Studio with tooling designed specifically for the application developer. With SSDT, developers no long need to constantly switch between VS and SSMS. In this session, Lenni demonstrates how SSDT is used to develop for (and deploy to) on-premise and SQL Azure databases. You will learn how to use code navigation, IntelliSense, and refactoring with your database model, and how to design databases offline and under source control right from VS. Donâ€™t miss out on this demo-centric information-packed session on the next generation of database tools for developers!
