## Title: Building Your Way to Better Database Testing
## Abstract:
### Test Data Builders. Ever heard of them? That's ok. Neither did I before I went looking for a convenient way to set up test data in SQL Server. I will show you what they are and how they work. More importantly, you will learn an easy way to get started and what you can do with them that could make your professional value grow and earn more money. I will also cover some of the design decisions you need to make so that they'll fit your needs.
