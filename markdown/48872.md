## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer
## Abstract:
### This is not your regular Agile BIML session. By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets. If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. We will see how to build a reusable C# framework that can be obfuscated and deployed to customers without worrying about Intellectual property. I promise you no more than a few slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration with Team Foundation Server.
