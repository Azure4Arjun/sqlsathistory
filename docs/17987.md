## Title: Database Design from User Requirements
## Abstract:
### Designing databases from User requirements is an art form even when you focus on implementing a strict ANSI compliant system. There is more to the database design then table structures and T-SQL statements.  In this session you will learn how to translate user requirements into a database design which utilizes the new and existing features to create an efficient and manageable system.
