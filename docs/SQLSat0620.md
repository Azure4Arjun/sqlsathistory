Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

# The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#620---Dublin-2017)
Event Date: 17-06-2017 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. 

This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change the methods you use to tune and troubleshoot query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts, as well as your Azure SQL Databases.

# Responding to Extended Events in near real-time
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#620---Dublin-2017)
Event Date: 17-06-2017 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Gianluca Sartori
## Title: Responding to Extended Events in near real-time
## Abstract:
### Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, a way to react to the events as soon as they happen seems to be lacking.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions.

## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: Taming the Open Source Beast with Azure for Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Today, CIOs and other business decision-makers are increasingly recognizing the value of open source software and Azure cloud computing for the enterprise, as a way of driving down costs whilst delivering enterprise capabilities.

For the Business Intelligence professional, how can you introduce Open Source into the Enterprise in a robust way, whilst also creating an architecture that accommodates cloud, on-premise and hybrid architectures?

We will examine strategies for using open source technologies to improve existing common Business Intelligence issues, using Azure as our backdrop. These include:

- incorporating Apache projects, such as Apache Tika, for your BI solution
- using Redis Cache in Azure in as a engine as part of your SSIS toolkit

Join this session to learn more about open source in Azure for Business Intelligence. Open Source does not mean on premise.
Demos will provide practical takeaways in your Business Intelligence Enterprise architecture.

# Plan Cache Pollution: Dealing with Ad Hoc Madness
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#620---Dublin-2017)
Event Date: 17-06-2017 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: Kimberly Tripp
## Title: Plan Cache Pollution: Dealing with Ad Hoc Madness
## Abstract:
### How you execute your data requests can have a profound effect on performance and plan reuse. Did you ever wonder where that estimate (in the showplan) comes from? Is it correct or, is it way off? Why? You’ve probably heard that many of your problems are related to statistics. Potentially, you’ve even rebuilt statistics only to find that it fixes the problem. However, what you might be seeing is a false positive. And, it doesn’t always work. Come to this session to find out how you should be executing your statements for the best performance, caching, and reuse! We'll look at ad hoc statements, dynamically constructed statements, and sp_executesql (e.g. forced statement caching) and I’ll debunk the mysteries around estimates so that you can solve performance problems the RIGHT way! If you want to demystify SQL Server's decisions used for statement execution, query plans, and plan caching – this is the place to be!

# Performance tips for faster SQL queries – DEV2DEV
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#620---Dublin-2017)
Event Date: 17-06-2017 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: Emanuele Zanchettin
## Title: Performance tips for faster SQL queries – DEV2DEV
## Abstract:
### When you need to extract data from the database you are writing, more or less complex, T-SQL code. Often simplistic and procedural approach reflects what you have in your mind, however this could have a negatively impact about performance because the database engine might think otherwise. Fortunately T-SQL, as a declarative language, allows us to ask the "what" and delegate to the engine the "how". Everything works best as long as you respect a few simple rules and you may use special constructs. In this session, with few slides and a lot of real-case scenarios, you can see the advantages of writing the query for high performance, even when they are written by that "someone else" called ORM.
