## Title: SQL 101: A Very Good Place to Start
## Abstract:
### We’ll use Azure Data Studio to dive into the basics of T-SQL queries. In this interactive, all-demo session I’ll take you on a tour of basic queries and filter operators as we build out some single table queries and multi-table joins. We’ll also cover some basic data aggregations and talk a little bit about what the SQL query optimizer is doing under the covers to return your results as quickly as possible.
