## Speaker: Andr√© Kamman
## Title: Private Cloud for DBAs
## Abstract:
### It's probably rare that you have to install a SQL Server instance manually. You most likely have some unattended install scripts ready and perhaps even a script, using powershell, which configures the newly installed SQL Server according to your (corporate) standards.

But "at home" developers can click a few buttons in Windows Azure and have a SQL Server available within minutes. They are starting to be less impressed with your one-day process. In this session I'll walk you through the steps that you can take to create your own private cloud. Including rolling out sysprepped SQL Server vm's, giving your internal customers self-service capabilities but without losing control over your (corporate) standards. Did you know that you can even get a user interface for your internal customers which looks exacly like the Windows Azure interface?
