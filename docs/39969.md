## Speaker: George Bryant
## Title: Cortana Analytics with Power BI
## Abstract:
### The content is purposefully casual and based around EPL Fantasy Football and sports metrics (for the English premier League). We will explore the use of great new tools such as Power Query, Power Pivot, and subsequently Power BI in order to create the perfect fantasy football team. 

Power BI does not just have to be for the Corporate world. John and Jane should be loving this too.
