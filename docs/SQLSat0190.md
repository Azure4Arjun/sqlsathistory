# Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-190)
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: More DBA
## Speaker: Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware
## Abstract:
### The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

## Speaker: Matt Henderson
## Title: How flash storage modernizes databases and tips for tuning databases for all flash arrays
## Abstract:
### For decades the characteristics of spinning hard drives have acted as a tail wagging the dog requiring the processes and behaviors of software, architecture and administrators to bend to its requirements.  With the advent of a new technology, flash storage, comes the unleashing of a new round of performance potential as well as a shedding of long encumbering patterns.  Modernizing databases is about both vastly boosting performance and also significantly reducing the complexity and effort to maintain them.  Come see a deep dive into how ultra-fast and random-optimized storage is modernizing database performance, architecture and maintenance.

# SQL Server encryption 3 ways - in transit, at rest and in the database
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-190)

## Speaker: Dan Hess
## Title: SQL Server encryption 3 ways - in transit, at rest and in the database
## Abstract:
### Dude, where's my keys??!?!

Confused about the various ways SQL Server handles encryption? Tasked with securing your environment or trying to pass an audit? There's a lot of information that can be difficult to wade through. In this session, I'll go over three ways to encrypt SQL Server, showing practical examples of the various techniques. We'll look at encrypting the information at the network level (in transit), encrypting the data and backup files (at rest using Transparent Data Encryption) and encryption of sensitive information in the database (columns and stored procedures). 

This will be a high level, hands-on discussion that will enable any administrator to put the techniques discussed into practice immediately.  You'll see how encryption will fit into your overall security scheme.

## Abstract:
### So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.

## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: Periodic Table of DMVs: Part Two - The SQL
## Abstract:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In the first version of this presentation we discussed organization of the DMOs - this time around we're going to get our hands dirty and see how we can use them to diagnose, tune, and get deep insight into your SQL Servers.

## Title: Documentation – you know you love it
## Abstract:
### We will discuss some of the most important things that you as a Data Professional can document to make your job much easier, ensure information consistency between groups, and better prepare your organizations for raising the bar on your day to day business.  Think of this as a sort of Database Library that allows you to finally detail the processes you follow currently to perform repetitive tasks.  This Library will also allow you to simply document your systems for your and others knowledge.

## Speaker: Wendy Pastrick
## Title: Navigating the Options for Data Redundancy
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has so many options for data redundancy, how do you know when you should use replication, or log shipping or AlwaysOn, etc? We will use real world examples where data redundancy is needed and discuss which is the appropriate technology and why. This is more than just a high availability vs disaster recovery discussion. If you have ever been confused or overwhelmed by all of the options, they will be broken down and made clear in this session.
