## Abstract:
### Hopefully you are monitoring your SQL Servers using DIY scripts or a 3rd party tool. Active monitoring is invaluable to enable the operational DBA to identify and address issues quickly. But did you know that SentryOne offers capabilities beyond just monitoring? Join me and I'll show you how SentryOne provides environment wide visibility and aids in managing cross-server activities. I'll showcase how alerting can be tuned to be effective and not noise. And you'll discover how SentryOne can give you both operational and business value to address your application challenges.
