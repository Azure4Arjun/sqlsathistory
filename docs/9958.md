## Title: The Performance Impact of Database Design
## Abstract:
### Time-travel stories all have one common plot element - some action done in the past has big impact on the future. Sometimes you get lucky… Hoverboards! Sometimes, not so much... Morlocks! The same holds true in your database. Design decisions have a huge impact on how you’re going to get data into and out of your database. This session illustrates the performance impact of common database design issues and proposes design alternatives that will help your database avoid an H.G. Wellsian future.
