## Title: Big Data and Hadoop: A primer for the weary DBA
## Abstract:
### Big Data has become a corporate and household buzzword. But is it just that? You really need to start learning about it as soon as possible. Come learn about what happens to the tons of your personal data that you leave behind knowingly or unknowingly, like bread crumbs for various entities for the devil and the angel alike.
We'll also discuss various real life examples like detection and spread of Ebola virus, the 2016 elections, the traffic patterns in a third world country; all of this using Big Data.
You will also learn how Big Data is produced, processed(with cheap hardware using Hadoop like environments), reported and acted upon by producing meaningful and actionable reports/predictions.
Over and above, we'll also take a quick peek at some of the huge and successful installations of Hadoop ecosystems around the world; installations that affect our lives.
