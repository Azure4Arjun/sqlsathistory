## Title: "Big Data" - Utah's Strong Position for Building a Big Data Cluster
## Abstract:
### Utah has one of the most advanced high tech sectors of any state in the United States that has grown for the last thirty years with key strengths in enterprise software, networking software, cloud technologies, and data centers.  All of these are key components to developing a strong "big data" cluster and with the right positioning and collaboration, Utah can build on its core cluster strengths to become a place with deep competencies and strong differentiation in the "big data" world.
