## Title: Windows Clustering for the DBA Part 2
## Abstract:
### In part 1 you learned how to plan your network, DNS, Active Directory, and storage.  You know what you need to plan a successful implementation and now it's time to put the plan into action.  I'll demonstrate setting up a multi-subnet cluster so you know exactly how to do it when you get back to the office.  I'll also show you things like Node Draining, Priority Startup, Cluster Aware Updating, and Dynamic Quorum that ensure your database is always available.
