## Speaker: Bill Graziano
## Title: Designing for Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing
## Abstract:
### In modern applications supporting hundreds or thousands of users (or devices), concurrency or code that doesnâ€™t block is more important than raw, blazing speed.  This presentation will start with approaches to write more concurrent  transactions.  It will cover strategies to process data asynchronously and methods to maintain read-only reporting databases.  Technologies covered will include T-SQL, isolation levels, Change Tracking and Change Data Capture, Service Broker, replication, database mirroring and Availability Groups.
