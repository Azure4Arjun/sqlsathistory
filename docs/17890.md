## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database Design: Silver Lining and Dark Side
## Abstract:
### Data modelers and designers need to understand the logical, physical, and technical differences in designing for Windows Azure SQL Databases (WASDs) and traditional on-premise SQL Server databases. In this session, we'll review the concepts that still work in both and the features that need to be tailored to each target environment.

You’ll see demonstrations of the database design processes and gain best practices for model-driven development for each environment, including tool support. The session will feature a demonstration of a complete life cycle roundtrip – data model to database and back to data model – and tips and tricks for creating and maintaining WASD database designs. We’ll finish up with 10 tips for designing databases for both WASD and SQL Server.
