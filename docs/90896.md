## Title: Containers: Crash course for SQL Server DBAs
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about these “Container” things? You may have questions like “What is a Container?”, Who is this “Docker?”, “Aren’t containers a Linux Thing?” and “As a DBA why do I care?” Sit back and listen as we cover these questions and many more. We will then take a closer look at leveraging Containers in a SQL world. We will review the published Microsoft SQL Server container images, what you can do with them and why you would want to use them. We will then show some examples of running MS SQL Server in a container on both a Windows host and a Linux host. This is a great introduction to Containers as well as what is possible with SQL Server in a container.
