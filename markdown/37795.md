## Title: A journey through the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### The traditional data warehouse has been the key of our business analytics architecture for many years. In a world ruled by the data culture concept, new challenges are emerging: data growth; unstructured data; hidden patterns and cloud-born data.
Which is the best architecture in order to get over these new challenges? 
Join this session and learn how to enable the Modern Data Warehouse in your organization using Cubes, HDInsight, AzureML, Stream Analytics and DocumentDB. All through a continuous example using a retail shop scenario.
