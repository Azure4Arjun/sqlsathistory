## Title: What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### If you haven't been pro-active and set up some sort of tracing, does that mean there is nothing you can do to find out what problematic queries might be running? The answer is no. 

In this session, we'll explore SQL Server's plan cache, from the way it is managed in memory, to the tools and techniques for discovering what plans are in cache, how long they've been there, how often they've been run, and whether they contain any suspected sub-optimal operators, such as table scans and hash joins. Knowing what's happened is the first step in knowing what needs to be fixed.
