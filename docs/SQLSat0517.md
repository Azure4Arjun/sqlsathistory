# 3 Ways for Getting Data from SharePoint : SSIS, Excel and Access
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: David Patrick
## Title: 3 Ways for Getting Data from SharePoint : SSIS, Excel and Access
## Abstract:
### Need to report on some data from SharePoint? We'll look at three different techniques to pull data from a SharePoint Server. We'll start with SSIS and the SharePoint List Source and Destinations. Next, we'll use Excel to connect to various SharePoint lists (both online and on premise), and finally we'll use Microsoft Access to do the same thing (and throw in the capability to do updates as well). At the end of the talk, we'll have three different ways to get data from SharePoint.

## Speaker: Greg Moore
## Title: Tips that have saved my bacon
## Abstract:
### In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others

## Speaker: James Serra
## Title: Big data architectures and the data lake
## Abstract:
### With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!

# Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

## Speaker: Niran Even-Chen
## Title: Architecting virtual SQL server for performance 
## Abstract:
### Today, many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the author of the official SQL server on VMware best practices guide.

## Speaker: Vince Napoli
## Title: Row Level Security in the BI Environment
## Abstract:
### Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server, and also even Cell level security in SSAS, to mask data from other users is a common request and a component in your security and data access model for a data warehouse and BI environment.   Information is valuable, but will be a double edge sword if not protected, and should only made visible to only those that should receive it.   In this session, we describe the design considerations, highlight multiple scenarios for querying and reporting, and demonstrate how to apply Row Level Security in both pre-SQL 2016, and implementing it using the new Row Level Security feature in SQL 2016.    We will also touch on briefly cell level security in SSAS.

Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Andy Mallon
## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
## Abstract:
### High-end storage is expensive, and SQL Server data compression can make your database smaller. So compress all the tables! No--unfortunately, it's not that easy. We'll talk about how data compression actually works, and the differences between ROW and PAGE compression. As part of this, we'll look at the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

# Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load
## Abstract:
### Loading data via SSIS is great! It’s fast too! Until you hit a bad record. Then things aren’t so great. Now you probably have to waste time dumping and reloading all the data, or worst figure out where the bad record is and try a partial load.

In this session you will learn a simple method to load data via SSIS and identify, remove, and record those bad records allowing you to maximize the amount of data loaded while ensuring data integrity.

# DevOps Is Coming to an Enterprise near You
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Denis McDowell
## Title: DevOps Is Coming to an Enterprise near You
## Abstract:
### Companies are creating more and more technology service offerings, but they are often throttled by IT. To address this, many IT departments are adapting a new concept called DevOps. DevOps is a concept that has risen quickly from niche to mainstream within the IT enterprise. At its core, DevOps represents a way to leverage people, processes, and tools to remove barriers and improve service delivery. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server professionals. This session discusses how technologies such as virtualization, the cloud, and software-defined datacenters have blurred the lines between developers and sysdmins. We also talk about the competencies and tools required to succeed in an increasingly data-driven workplace.

# Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Ray Kim
## Title: Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery
## Abstract:
### I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.

# Getting Started with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

# 10 Things Administrators of BI Systems Should Know
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#517---Philadelphia-2016)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: 10 Things Administrators of BI Systems Should Know
## Abstract:
### Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator?

Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
