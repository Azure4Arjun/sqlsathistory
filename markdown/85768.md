## Speaker: Jessica Jolly
## Title: Data here, there and everywhere
## Abstract:
### Geography often plays a big role in our data analysis. Power BI offers several standard map options to help us understand where our data happens. This session will explore the three standard maps, including ESRI. We will compare the type of data that best fits each map. We will also look at the ESRI Plus subscription and it's benefits. If you have data with a geographical component, this session will get you started mapping it.
