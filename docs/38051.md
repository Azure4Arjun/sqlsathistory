## Title: SSAS: Zero to Cube in Sixty Minutes
## Abstract:
### For data sets ranging from a few gigabytes to tens of terabytes, Microsoftâ€™s SSAS can be the tool of choice. In this session, we start off by covering basic terminologies and the usage of the SSAS tool to build cubes, analyze datasets and build up to the usage of SSAS on terabyte sized datasets. We further focus on some of the surprisingly straightforward techniques while dealing with such large datasets. Finally, we cover the ease of use of the SSAS tool and its inherent advantages while interoperating with reporting tools.
