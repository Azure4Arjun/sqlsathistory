## Title: Scaling Out Microsoft Azure SQL Databases
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure SQL offers a variety of service tiers and performance levels to fit the diverse needs of database applications in the cloud. For each tire, the maximum database size is limited (up to 500GB), so when additional resources are required scaling out becomes necessary. This requires sharding, which horizontally partitions data across multiple databases.  Each database in this model is referred to as a shard.
Azure SQL Database supports three methods to implement sharding: Elastic Scale, Custom Sharding and Federations
This talk is a comparison and overview of these approaches, to be possible to choose the best one in your practice.
