## Title: Transactional Replication: Architecture, Setup, and Monitoring
## Abstract:
### At some point in every DBA's career they'll be probably be asked to work with transactional replication. While it may seem scary at first, it's not that complicated once you understand how all the parts and pieces work together. In this session we'll cover the fundamentals of how transactional replication works, walk through setting up a working replication topology, and learn how to keep an eye on things to make sure everything is working properly. You'll return to work with the confidence and know-how that you need to set up and manage a transactional replication topology.
