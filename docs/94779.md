## Speaker: Alexander Lemkin
## Title: Goodbye Classes: Writing React the Functional Way
## Abstract:
### Whether you are new to React, or a veteran, there is plenty to gain from this talk.

In this session you will learn techniques using higher order functions to keep your React and JavaScript code functional and maintainable. The recompose library is going to be used to accomplish this in React.

We will be referencing a full front end stack utilizing the most up to date modern web stack for Single Page Application (SPA) development: Webpack 4, React 16, Redux, Bootstrap 4, ESLint with StandardJS, Sagas, and Jest. 

A reasonable familiarity with JavaScript is expected, as well as Node and npm are prerequisites to running this locally.
