## Title: Discover the Hidden Mysteries of Common Table Expressions
## Abstract:
### Although they have been around since SQL Server 2005, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) have been a complete mystery to many.  As a result, there are many misunderstood myths and assumptions surrounding them. This session will explore deep into CTEs, what they are, what they are not, and how they work.  We'll look at situations where they can really help improve not only code clarity but also performance especially when compared side-by-side to usual methods.  We'll also identify situations where CTEs can be used incorrectly causing hidden performance problems.
