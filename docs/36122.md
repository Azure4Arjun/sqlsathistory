## Title: JS Approaches for the .NET Developer
## Abstract:
### From SPA's to sites requiring a minimal front-end, we'll explore a few different approaches for setting up, bundling, and writing JavaScript in a way that fits the demands of your specific project.  The session will be delivered through examples using Visual Studio, MVC, and AngularJS, but the overall analysis of pros/cons in front-end heavy sites and project organization can be applied in ways that are framework agnostic.
