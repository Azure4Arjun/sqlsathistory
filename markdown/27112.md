## Title: Smooth Data Moves
## Abstract:
### An exploration into a way to move database data from a source to one or more destinations. This session will show you how to use dynamic bindings at runtime to avoid having to rebuild SSIS packages when schemas change. We will look at sending data to both SQL Server and Oracle databases without even knowing the column names. This metadata-driven solution will help you to develop faster and move data quickly with bcp capabilities.  Attend this session to see how ODP .Net can help you look like a rock star.
