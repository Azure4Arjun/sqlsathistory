## Title: How to build a T-SQL Framework
## Abstract:
### What is a T-SQL framework and how will it help you as a developer.

In this session we will create a framework that we can leverage through a template that will take care of the tedious tasks that come with development.  These tasks or features include audit logging, designing a dynamic data driven error handling process, and control level batching in order to document, troubleshoot, and base line your code base.  Once these features are developed you can spend more time in doing what really needs to happen like developing logic to perform processes while allowing the framework to control the necessary error handling tasks for you so you can continue to produce rapid development code.
