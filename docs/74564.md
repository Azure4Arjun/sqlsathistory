## Title: Rub DevOps on all the things!
## Abstract:
### What is DevOps and why should you rub it on anything?
In this session we'll explore, through demo's, how a DevOps mindset changed my personal way of working and development of database and BI solutions.
We'll shortly discuss what this actually means and in the demo's you'll see how to automate the deployment of your own databases, SSIS, SSRS and SSAS projects. On top of that, you'll experience the simple patterns and how to overcome blockers so you too can finally start to automate the deployment of just about anything.
