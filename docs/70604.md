## Title: ARMed for Azure
## Abstract:
### The Azure Resource Model (ARM) enables Azure infrastructure automation for both IaaS and PaaS deployments.  Using Visual Studio as a management tool enables repeatable, automated, source controlled deployments for test and development environments, enabling true DevOps practices for all aspects of pre-production systems.  In this session, I will demonstrate, explain, and deploy a IaaS/PaaS hybrid environment (SQL and BI stack elements) using ARM templates, Visual Studio, source control integration, and PowerShell scripts.
