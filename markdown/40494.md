## Title: The What, Why and How of Unit Testing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### We all write SQL scripts but how do we know that what we write is returning the correct results?  In this session I will explain the importance of unit testing your code, what to test for and most importantly what free tools you can use to make this easy.  By the end of this session you will be equipped with the information you need to go and implement unit testing on your code so that you can confidently carry out stress-free system releases.
