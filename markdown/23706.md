## Title: Introduction to Excel pivot tables
## Abstract:
### When people have a pile of data on which they need to do some basic analysis, most still turn to Excel as an easy-to-use data analysis tool. While there are many advanced BI tools you can use to help data tell the story, one of the easiest to use is built-in functionality, the Excel pivot table. In this session, we’ll review what a pivot table is, how to put your data together to leverage the power behind it, and do some demonstrations. We’ll also, time permitting, get into some of the more advanced features of pivot tables and show how they can be used to do some pretty advanced data analysis and aggregation.
