## Speaker: Sebastian Meine
## Title: Performance Troubleshooting for the Accidental DBA
## Abstract:
### Were you roped into “taking care” of SQL Server, gaining the “coveted” title DBA? (Had you only known…)

Do you have to deal with frequent performance problems like the app throwing timeouts at the users or the daily reports closing in on 24 hours runtime?

Does it seem, constant blocking or frequent deadlocks are now a common part of your daily agenda?
So, how do you even know where to start? Do you “add more indexes”, “increase memory”, “buy a new SAN”, “update statistics”, “move to the cloud”, or something else entirely?

The good news: SQL Server provides the tools you need to clear the fog and identify exactly what the problem is.

In this session, we’ll take a look at the query store, wait stats, live execution plans and more. After attending you’ll have the tools you need to be able to quickly identify the exact culprit in any low-performance situation.

And, next time your boss breathes down your neck, you might even be able to point out that SQL Server is not the problem.
