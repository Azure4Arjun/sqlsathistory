## Title: Even I Can Power BI!
## Abstract:
### Power BI Desktop is so intuitive when it comes to creating reports that even a 13 year old can do it.  In fact I'm 13 and I can do it! Don't believe me?  Come to my session as I demonstrate how to import data, create dashboards, and publish them to the Power BI service.
