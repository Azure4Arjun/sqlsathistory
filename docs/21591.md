## Title: Big Data! What's the Big Deal?
## Abstract:
### For decades humans have been collecting data in ever increasing formats and exponentially increasing volumes. Data collection tools have historically outnumbered data analytics tools, hence leading to a huge backlog of raw data waiting to be analyzed. This backlog has increased dramatically in recent years with the explosion of social media and the advent of a plethora of Internet connected devices. The challenge in clearing the backlog was exacerbated by requirements imposed by various analytics technologies to get data into common formats that would then be pumped into standardized data models.  The big data revolution challenges this approach by tapping into various, high velocity and large volume sources to identify correlations and patterns that we could only dream of identifying using traditional analytic technologies. In this presentation I will discuss the history of big data tools and will briefly discuss Microsoft HDInsight,an Apache Hadoop compatible Big Data implementation.
