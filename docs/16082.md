## Title: Pervasive business information through Mobile BI
## Abstract:
### There’s no arguing the proliferation of mobile devices in our society.  Mobile devices offer BI teams a very exciting new product offering, Mobile BI.  Early studies indicate Mobile BI can dramatically increase user adoption.  It also allows BI teams to market to new customer segments.  While the possibilities are great, Mobile BI also introduces a number of challenges that can push a BI team out of their comfort zone.

In this session we’ll discuss the pros and cons of Mobile BI.  We’ll discuss common use cases and look at best practices for developing mobile visualizations in the Microsoft BI stack on both Windows 8 and iOS platforms.
