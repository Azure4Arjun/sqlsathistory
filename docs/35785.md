## Title: Data Career Paths and Decision Making Strategies
## Abstract:
### In recent years Data Careers have expanded beyond the conventional role of a DBA.  This is due to the ever expanding amount of data, a larger variety of tools and the need for business to use data to drive their own performance goals. This session will provide an overview of Data Careers, a discussion of personal traits and life stages that may align with different Data Careers.  The new Career areas such as Data Science, Analytics and Data Journalism will be reviewed.  In addition, the attendees will be provided with a template that will enable them to make more strategic career-related decisions.
