## Title: Schizophrenic High Availability with SQL and Windows 2016
## Abstract:
### As SQL Server, Windows and Cloud availability solutions have reached maturity, their capabilities and interoperability has grown to such an extent that it is no longer clear what technologies to use, when to use them, what they deliver and when things can go wrong.

In this session we will take a look at some of the new features provided by SQL Server and Windows 2016, how existing high availability solutions can benefit from their adoption and when schizophrenic HADR can be bad idea!
