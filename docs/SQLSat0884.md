## Speaker: Mike Burek
## Title: Understanding Deadlock Printouts in the Error Log
## Abstract:
### You know to look out for deadlocks on your system. You know how to capture deadlocks to your error log. You know some techniques to apply to problem code to reduce deadlocks. But…

Going through the error log is a pain. There are many extraneous values. The details you want are buried in there somewhere, and don't always make sense. Why isn't it easier to find exactly where the deadlock is occurring?

Come walk with me through the error log to find all the details we need. There are many helpful details in the log you didn't know existed because they were hard to read. We can find out where in the code a deadlock happened, which objects deadlocked,  and why they deadlocked. We'll go through the extra values to help put meaning to them. After doing this a few times, it gets easier to find the main details you want, and have supporting evidence when you need it.

Event Date: 29-06-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Paul LaGrone
## Title: Do I need to know about BIML? Of course you do!
## Abstract:
### This topic will be about creating dynamic SSIS packages using BIML. Dynamic SSIS packages will help eliminate the hassle of having to manually change items in a Data Flow task when an underlying table change occurs. This talk will start from the ground up, showing a basic SSIS package, what it would take to create it dynamically in C#, and then the same package using BIML. While we will show some examples of BIML and C#, no experience in either of these is required, as the talk will be more concepts to get ideals flowing.

If you have data to move, BIML could be your new friend!

## Title: Look, over there, your permissions are showing!
## Abstract:
### You just walked into that fancy new gig, and you're getting your first cup of coffee.  Your boss walks up and asks, "Who has access to that prod server?", do you know how to get the answers in the next hour?  More importantly, do you know what these permissions mean, what an attacker could do with these permissions?  In this session we'll start from scratch assuming that you have no experience with an audit with this question in mind.  We'll work back from here to develop a strategy of how to harden your server.

# Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#884---Pensacola-2019)

## Speaker: Bill Anton
## Title: Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar
## Abstract:
### In the world of Power BI, data modeling is what separates the Rockstars from the Rookies. Join me to learn how dimensional modeling - a concept developed 20+ years ago - continues to be the best approach for delivering self-service BI to the masses.

Not only will good data modeling result in better Power BI solutions that support a wider range of reporting requirements, but they will also be easier for the business users to understand and work with. 

In this session, you'll learn how to create flexible data models that can be expanded upon over time, unlock the power of the date table, and a variety of DAX patterns supporting common but complex business logic.
 
If your Power BI solutions typically contain a single table, if you're frequently banging your head against the wall trying to figure out how to write a DAX calculation, or if you've never heard the term "dimensional model" this session is for you.

## Title: How to perform a health check
## Abstract:
### Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, we’ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.
