## Title: Processing Large Tabular models with Analysis Services Partition Manager
## Abstract:
### Processing of Tabular model is very common situation, there are many of solution for this problem: starting from  SSIS packages and ends on Azure Logic App. But what, when there is very large data model and time for processing limited to 5 minutes? The full processing takes too long, what's more there is no necessary to reload all the data, only data from last month can be changed and needs to be reloaded. In this case Partition manager is good solution which can limit the processing time to necessary minimum. During the session I will show how to easy implement solution, also I will tell about processing types and performance tips for large tabular models.
