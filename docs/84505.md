This talk will show some of the most useful, yet overlooked, features of SSMS and some of the best (and free) extensions to make life easier for you and your teams.  I'll also include some of my most useful code snippets that I've found or written over the years and a quick look at the new SQL Operations Studio.  Save yourself some time and headaches!
