## Title: Goin' Fishin' on the Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Get yer queries ready we're goin' fishin' on the Azure Data Lake. Azure Data Lake is hyper-scale storage service that serves as the foundation for a Modern Data Warehouse. We'll explore what makes this service unique, the pricing structure, and how to start storing data. Then we'll open our tackle boxes to learn how to use tools such as HDInsight, Azure SQL DW, and Data Lake Analytics (U-SQL) to access data for processing, analytics, and machine learning.
