## Title: Become a SQL Server Performance Detective
## Abstract:
### When your database is having performance issues, you need to quickly and accurately diagnose and resolve performance issues.  Like any good detective, you need to look for clues to find “The Smoking Gun.”  We will cover various tools at our disposal which can help us pinpoint and resolve issues quickly, using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs), SQL Profiler and other queries.   We will discuss emergent performance issues as well as chronic issues and find ways to piece together the clues to figure out the root cause of our problems.
