## Title: Dashboards for Everyone with Microsoft Power BI and Excel
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Excel – and their next generation cloud toolset Power BI - are the best kept secrets in business intelligence and analytics software.  Most of what executives and business analysts want from pricey analytics platforms can be accomplished immediately using Microsoft tools already installed on their desktops – including drag and drop visualization, mapping, business modeling, connecting to cloud data sources, and single-pane-of-glass dashboards.  Join Rusty Frioux, Sparkhound’s Analytics Strategist, as he creates a working dashboard in less than one hour from real live data sources using Microsoft’s current self-service business intelligence tools including Excel, Power Pivot, Power Query, Power View, and Power BI.
