## Title: Pretty Output: T-SQL for Presentation
## Abstract:
### So you've got your data in the database? That's great!  Now... how about getting it back out?  Sometimes complex reports call for complex queries, and this session is all about that.  Want to pivot your rows into columns?  Sure.  Want to format that self-referencing hierarchy?  Got it.  Ranking? Windowing? No problem.  In this session we'll cover some common data formatting issues and the T-SQL solutions that make them a little less scary.
