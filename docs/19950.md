## Title: A Practical Approach to Table Partitioning
## Abstract:
### There are many white papers and articles about table partitioning, but when it comes down to implementing partitioning there is little "real world" documentation.  This presentation will cover definitions (so you will know what I am talking about), tips on what tables to partition and how to pick a partition key, and finally a real world example with scripts on implementation and ongoing maintenance of the partitioned tables.
