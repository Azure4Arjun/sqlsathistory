## Title: Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs
## Abstract:
### Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? I know I am, so I'm doing something about it...I'm automating my installs!  From base SQL Server installs to Service Packs, Cumulative Updates and even Client Tools for DBA's and Developers, I'll show you ways to automate your installs using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project).  We'll cover many of the scenarios you may encounter and you'll walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.
