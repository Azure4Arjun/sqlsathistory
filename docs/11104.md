## Speaker: Dan Bulos
## Title: Getting your message across?  A practical guide to using charts  graphs!
## Abstract:
### There are many books and articles on how to design a dashboard or create a pretty chart. But how do you know which graphical representation is the right one for your data?  What kind of chart will answer the right business question?  Should you use a line, bar, or pie chart? (Yes, even a pie chart.  Stephen Few is not always correct in a business context.)  When should you use multiple series on a chart versus using small multiples?  What is the best way to show contribution to the whole?  Why would you mix a line and bar chart?  

This session will take a practical approach not theoretical one.  How to give your users and management what they are looking for in a way that balances information content vs. visual impact.  A visualization that not only answers the business questions but draws the eye to the most important aspects of the data.
