## Title: Who, What, When. Monitoring usage of your MS BI stack
## Abstract:
### You have created great cubes, Power BI reports and Reporting Services reports but how do you know if it is being used? Learn how to set up the collection of the usage data and how you can use this data in your decision making. 

We will talk about how to collect the data, how to build something meaningful from the data and how you can report on top of the data. We will do this for SSAS cubes (tabular and multidimensional), for Power BI reports and for Reporting Services Reports and we will explore ways you can further develop this for your own organization. 

At the end of the session all participants will leave with all the code as well as the know how to get started with the collection of usage statistics for their Microsoft BI Solutions.
