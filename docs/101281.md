## Title: Need to Monitor Any Azure Resource? Must Learn Kusto Query Language
## Abstract:
### Kusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data, easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to the cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of ‘Azure Monitor.’ Whether you are ‘detecting and diagnose issues across applications,’ ‘correlate infrastructure issues for VMs,’ ‘drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics,’ you will be using ‘Azure Monitor.’ Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, KQL must be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.

In this 95% demo session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. Come and learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.
