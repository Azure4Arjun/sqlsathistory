## Title: Self Service Business Intelligence: Model for High Efficiency
## Abstract:
### The goal of business intelligence is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Historically, the long-standing model for this process was completely IT owned. Business users had issues with the speed of delivery with this approach, along with the lack of flexibility. The self-service business intelligence model is a methodology that addresses these problems, and gives the end users more freedom with their data.

In this discussion, Zack Fanelle will be covering the intricacies of why the self-service business model drives high levels of efficiency and productivity. This requires a new approach to collaboration with the business and IT. In addition, he will be covering technical examples of what the model would look like in 2018 and how to take advantage of it using modern products.
