## Title: Rapid Data Warehouse Design and ETL
## Abstract:
### Simply loading a data warehouse is only part of an ETL developers role. In this example driven session, Brian and Sherri will show you how to create and load a small data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services. They will also show you how to make packages dynamic using variables and package configurations along with a few other "nice to have tricks" to include in your ETL arsenal. At the end of this session, you will be ready to take on the world. Well, maybe not the world, but you will know how to load a data warehouse.
