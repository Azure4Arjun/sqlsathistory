# Continuous Integration for the BI Developer
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1018)
Event Date: 05-12-2020 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Wolfgang Strasser
## Title: Continuous Integration for the BI Developer
## Abstract:
### In many cases and BI projects, the manual process of development and especially deployment of artefacts led to sleepless nights, emergency hotfixes, grey hair and many hours of stress.
Especially in BI development, the usage of database projects, unit testing, version control, continuous integration and deployment is an underrepresented area.
Join me in this demo-heavy session where I will guide you through the not-so-frightful jungle of continuous integration using SQL Server database projects, SSIS, T-SQLt and Azure DevOps etc.
After this 60 minutes you'll have the guidelines and some ideas how easy it is to change your manual BI development and deployment into a powerful and automated no-brainer that - just works!

# Different Types of Many-to-Many Relationships in Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1018)
Event Date: 05-12-2020 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: Different Types of Many-to-Many Relationships in Power BI
## Abstract:
### The new composite models in Power BI introduced a new type of relationship cardinality, called many-to-many. Nevertheless, despite their name, they are not many-to-many relationships, they are relationships between tables generated at a different granularity.

In this session, we clarify the purpose of the relationships with many-to-many cardinality, highlighting the significant difference with canonical many-to-many relationships. In the meantime, we show how and when to use the different kinds of many-to-many relationships with several practical examples.

Event Date: 05-12-2020 - Session time: 14:20:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Getting Started with Apache Spark
## Abstract:
### As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data. Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes. As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk. Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data. In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark. We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues when analyzing large data sets.

# Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-1018)
Event Date: 05-12-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Edward Pollack
## Title: Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Administrators and analysts often struggle with the storage and maintenance of reporting and analytics data.  Traditional rowstore tables do not scale well when data is measured in billions of rows.

Columnstore indexes provide a speedy and convenient way to store OLAP data within SQL Server.  Compression allows the data to be much smaller than other storage methods, allowing for faster reads.  Column metadata provides the tools needed for SQL Server to be able to service queries over massive data sets quickly and efficiently.

The basics of columnstore indexes allow an administrator to improve the performance of analytics, but there is much more to learn!  Understanding the internals of columnstore indexes allows querying to be even more efficient.

Columnstore indexes have evolved greatly since their introduction in SQL Server 2012.  This presentation explores this feature in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 and how its newest features can turbo-charge your analytics workloads!

Event Date: 05-12-2020 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Michael McKinley
## Title: Basic Data Modeling for BI Reporting
## Abstract:
### We all start using business intelligence tools by using a single dataset, like a flat file.  Then, we hit a plateau in our learning curve, or we add a second flat file into our BI product, and we get incorrect results.  One reason is that we haven't modeled our solution correctly.

In order to move to the next level of our journey along the BI learning curve, we need to understand how a tool like Power BI works.  Only then will we understand why we design our data models the way we do.

In this session, we will review how tools like Power BI work under the covers and how that impacts the way we construct our data models.  This is an introductory level course, so we will not get too technical, just enough to get us to the next level and moving back up that learning curve!
