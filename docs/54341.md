## Title: MMM: Making the Most of the M Language - Real World Power Query for Excel and Power BI
## Abstract:
### Learn how to leverage the diverse abilities of Power Query to acquire and transform data in this example driven session. Our journey will begin with CSV and we will work our way through HTML tables, JSON data, stop to examine REST and OData endpoints, and end with the spectacular view of connecting to SQL Server 2016. Each of these data types can present a unique opportunity to combine elements of the M language in Power Query to transform and massage the data before finally presenting to the visualization engine for display. Come learn to use the tricks of expanding records and nested tables to flatten out your data model and be better prepared to tackle any size or shape of data that comes your way.
