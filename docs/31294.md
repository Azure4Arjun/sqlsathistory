## Title: Statistics, how to prove everything but the truth.
## Abstract:
### “Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has a private jargon deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from non-practitioners.”  Ashley-Perry Statistical Axioms
Statistics are the life blood of a cost based optimizers such as SQL Server and are a key component of performance tuning. This session will attempt to demystify statistics in regards to SQL Server the query optimizer.  The internals of statistics will be examined and explained so that you will understand what statistics are available, how the optimizer uses those statistics, what causes statistics to be recomputed and when it happens.
