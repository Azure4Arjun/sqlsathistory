## Title: Detect Plan Regression with Query Store
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced Query Store in SQL Server 2016 and promised that it now becomes easy to analyze the entire query workload and detect plan regressions on a database level.
In this session, you will learn how Query Store works internally and to interpret the available reports to detect plan regression caused by parameter sniffing and by the new cardinality estimator.
