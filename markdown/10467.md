## Title: Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The fastest way to process large amounts of data in SQL Server is using set-based operations. That is if you can stand the blocking. This session walks through different ways to think about applications when transaction blocking becomes your biggest problem. It covers specific T-SQL suggestions to minimize the rows locked, application architectures to maximize concurrency and reporting solutions to reduce impact on the production database. And always lots of demos and spirited discussion.
