## Title: Seamlessly Scaling Azure SQL DB with Elastic Database Tools
## Abstract:
### Elastic Database Tools for Azure SQL DB offers a set of features that make it easier to build and manage a scaled-out data tier for cloud applications. With elastic database tools, applications can easily access data spanning multiple DBs, coordinate management tasks and manage how data is distributed among them. As part of the session, we explore workloads that are a natural fit for Azure SQL DB's elastic database tools. Patterns discussed in depth include multi-tenant applications created by cloud ISVs and SaaS vendors, and applications relying on temporal data distribution. The session will illustrate how easy it is now to build, scale and manage cloud applications in SQL DB when using elastic tools capabilities such as the elastic database client library for .NET.
