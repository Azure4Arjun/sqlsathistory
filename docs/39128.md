## Title: Data Partitioning - Doing the splitsâ€¦in the name of performance, scalability and sanity!
## Abstract:
### Does only a small portion of your data change on a routine basis? Is index maintenance taking forever? Do users mostly focus only on a subset of data such as the current year, month or day? Do you want to delete or insert massive amount s of data with almost no blocking? Well, step right up because data partitioning can do all this and more! We will take a look at the different option for partitioning, the pros and cons and how to implement them in SQL.
