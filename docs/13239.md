## Title: Parsing T-SQL using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library (C#)
## Abstract:
### T-SQL is a very complicated language to parse, so it can be intimidating to get started. We'll go over basic concepts of what a lexer/parser is and what to expect from it. Then, using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library in the SQL Server SDK, we'll do some examples to get our feet wet.
