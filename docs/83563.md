## Title: What's new in SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 was the surprise software hit of the year. Here is a list of the features I am going to focus on in this session:
Linux Version:
I will cover the things you need to know before you decide to move SQL Server into Linux.
Graph Tables:
I will cover why you may need to add Graph Tables into your database. You will learn the differences between Relational Database Tables and Graph Database Tables. 
Query Optimization:
We will look at the new Intelligent Query Processing options in Query Plans with demos.
Resumable Online Index Rebuild:
I will show you how to pause/resume ongoing index rebuild with demos.
Machine Learning Services:
I will demo how to run R Script in SQL Server 2017. We will look at the ways to monitor Machine Learning Services.
In-Memory Tables:
SQL Server 2017 became a great resource for caching with the new In-Memory features. We will create a NoSql Environment in SQL Server 2017 by using In-Memory tables and JSON functions
