## Title: Exploring The JSON Features In SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduced built-in JSON support, with new features that allow you do things like store JSON text in database tables, read and modify JSON, format the results of regular SQL queries into JSON, and transform JSON objects into table format. In this demo heavy session we’ll explore the new JSON functions and T-SQL enhancements that are now available, and find out just what SQL Server can (and can’t) do with JSON.
