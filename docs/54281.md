## Title: Real world In-Memory OLTP
## Abstract:
### What is the optimal way to migrate existing data to In-Memory? 
How does Garbage Collection work, what types of memory-optimized objects does it work with, and how can I make sure it's operational? 
What are the pros/cons of different ways of handling hot/cold data with In-Memory OLTP? 
What causes ALTER TABLE to be fully logged and serially executed?
All of these questions and more are answered as we discuss real-world usage of In-Memory OLTP.
