## Speaker: Tamera Clark
## Title: The Community Speaks: WIT, LGBTQ, diversity and inclusion.
## Abstract:
### Join us as we (yes, including attendees) discuss incidents and look for ways as victims, as by-standers and as event host to react.  Let’s enable each other to do what is right, speak up and support one another. It’s time for the community to come together, make their voice be heard and share ways and tools to deal with these difficult situations. Although some stores are inspired in part by a true incident, they are fictional and do not depict any actual person or event.
