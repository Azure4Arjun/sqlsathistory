## Title: Predicting the future with Machine Learning  
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning is Microsoftâ€™s big entry in to the predictive analytics arena. .  In this introductory session we will discuss the growing new field of predictive analytics and how Machine Learning is used to predict future results. Instead of staring into crystal balls, Machine Learning provides the ability to experiment to determine which algorithm or R code best analyzes the data to determine if past performance is indicative of the future or use scoring to find a more appropriate model.
