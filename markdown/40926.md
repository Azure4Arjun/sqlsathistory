In this pre-conference session we'll go over what every developer dealing with SQL Server and .Net has to know to be as effective and productive as possible. Because speed is important too, we'll also focus on areas where you as a developer can contribute most.

We'll cover:
- Basic normal forms, data structures and data types.
- The query optimizer, workers and threads.
- Isolation levels and locking.
- Tips and tricks will teach you to write better queries. Diving into the .Net SqlClient will teach you some interesting database access features to make your programming easier
