## Title: Learn How to Master DATETIME Functions Like a Boss in 59.5 Minutes or Less
## Abstract:
### Do you know the dates of the 1st Monday, 2nd Tuesday, 3rd Wednesday, and 4th Thursday of any month between the 22 weeks and 47 weeks of any given year? 
Do you know the date that Daylight Savings starts in Nashville 4 years from now?

Yup, those were silly questions. However, there is nothing trivial about working within the complexity of dates and times. Trains, Planes, and sometimes at automobile races depend on precise and accurate date-time recordings. 

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will answer the following questions and more:
When to use DATETIME and DATETIME2 and why.
How do you filter date ranges that will make SQL Server run faster?
How language and date formatting affect EVERYTHING.
What's the best way to work with functions relating to the current date and time.
What's the best way to properly use SWITCHOFFSET, TODATETIMEOFFSET and AT TIME ZONE Functions. 

So stop wasting time and get on board because it's about time for the plane to depart.
