## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: DevOps 101 for Data Folks
## Abstract:
### DevOps has fundamentally changed the way we manage IT. Those practicing DevOps well aren't just outpacing their competitors, they are annihilating them. DevOps brings a whole host of new practices, tools and buzzwords. It has made some roles and  tasks redundant, while new opportunities have been created.

We all need to learn to survive in this new reality.

In this session we'll cut through the hype and look at the key concepts and findings from the Puppet State of DevOps Reports,  The DevOps Handbook and Microsoft's work in this space.

We will finish with an overview of an Azure DevOps Services project that automatically tests and deploys the code from a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project in a public GitHub repo.
