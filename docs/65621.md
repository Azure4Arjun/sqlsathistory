## Title: Automate your SSIS deployment process
## Abstract:
### Deploying SSIS projects is a daunting manual task we do every time in SQL Server Data Tools. Rebuild/Deploy/Validate/Execute. Add version control to it, branch, merge, add packages to projects, switch between DEV/TEST/PROD environments - it's getting even more boring.

On this session I will show you how to put all that tasks to the server side. You'll see how to use Powershell and API available in .NET. Or MSBuild. I will add a bit of TFS to it to automate all things and you'll see that testing and deployment of subsequent project versions doesn't have to be so bothersome.

You will see what to look at when designing your own solution, what resources to use, what limitations await and how to overcome them.
