## Title: Managing Excel Power Query With VBA
## Abstract:
### In this demo-rich session, we will show how VBA can be utilised to create and manage Power Query queries within Excel, using Excel functionality and external files, all without using Power Query directly. The Power Query UI is used to validate that queries and functions are bona-fide.
We start by building a query from within Excel VBA to demonstrate the capability and functionality available to the developer. Then we will show how to manage a library of Power Query functions using this VBA technique, demonstrating the usage of one of these functions. Time permitting, we will go on to show how we can extend this technique, taking a multi-company dataset and splitting it into multiple queries, building a template query that can be used to create the multiple queries. All of this will be done without using the Power Query UI, nor even opening Power Query.
It is assumed that delegates will be familiar with VBA and Power Query, using the Power Query UI, basic M, and Power Query functions.
