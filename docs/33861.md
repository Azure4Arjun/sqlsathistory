## Speaker: Wayne Snyder
## Title: Information: Are You Blinded by the Light ?
## Abstract:
### This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. You will be surprised. Join me - this session is going to be hoot!
