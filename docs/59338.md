## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: A Key to Keys
## Abstract:
### So many of us have learned data modeling and database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one design tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product-specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK? Do you know if your surrogate keys have their companion alternate keys?  Do you know about weak versus strong keys?

In this session we’ll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the data modeling and database design process.  We’ll also look at implementation options in SQL Server 2016 -- what works, what really doesn't work, and what mistakes are commonly made in implementing keys.
