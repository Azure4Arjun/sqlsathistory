# A Map To Success:  Functional Programming For Database Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: .NET Dev
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: A Map To Success:  Functional Programming For Database Developers
## Abstract:
### Over the past several years, we have seen a resurgence of interest in functional programming languages, particularly with the success of Scala and R in the marketplace.  Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java.  This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding  functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.

In this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#.  We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language.  We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries.

# Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: SQL Server Development
## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

# Catching up with Angular 7
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: .NET Dev
## Speaker: Ryan Richard
## Title: Catching up with Angular 7
## Abstract:
### If you are new to Angular, or still working on an older version, then it's time to catch up with Angular 7.  In this session, we will review a simple Single Page Application (SPA) built with the Angular 7 framework, TypeScript and Bootstrap.

# PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: PowerShell
## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server professional, are you able to make a rhyme or reason to this thing called PowerShell? Need to accomplish something? Do you use Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core? How will you interface with PowerShell? With the PowerShell console, ISE, VSCode, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, or something else? Will you use Cmdlets from one of the various SQL related PowerShell modules? If so, which one? SQLPS, SQLServer, DBATools, etc. Or maybe you should use the SQL PS provider? What about SMO? Or write your own custom .NET code that can be executed with PowerShell? With it being so difficult to determine how to go about running something in PowerShell, it’s no wonder that most people resort to searching the Internet to figure it out. The sad thing is that most of the PowerShell code you’ll find on the Internet is less than optimal to say the least. I'll demonstrate how and when to use different approaches along with adhering to the community’s best practices for writing PowerShell code.

# Why There are No Code Problems, Only Organizational Culture Problems
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Agile
## Speaker: Andrew Barefield
## Title: Why There are No Code Problems, Only Organizational Culture Problems
## Abstract:
### Everyone is fascinated by startups.  We watch in awe at the market disruption that some technology companies can create.  The most successful of these plucky, fast-moving startups may grow into large companies.  

The quickest and most disruptive companies may soon struggle under the weight of the increasing scale, expectations, and a shifting organizational culture.   Solving code problems is suddenly no longer the most difficult issue.
 
Have you ever been frustrated at how long it takes to be able to change something in your job, product or organization?  Have you ever measured how long it takes to get a change that's only a few lines of code into production?  Have you ever wondered why the chat service Slack doesn't have a "dark mode"?

Join to discuss
•	how organizations (some real, some apocryphal) deal with product and technology changes
•	how you fit in as a developer, DBA, manager or other consultant, and 
•	what we can all do about it when we get back to work on Monday

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments
## Abstract:
### Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.

## Abstract:
### The ideal way to become a SQL Server professional is to get a degree, get a junior position, and then work your way up. But, the vast majority of data professionals don’t follow this path! Instead, most of us start out as “accidental DBAs” and fumble our way into a full time data career.
This is not ideal, and we could all use some help navigating through resumes, job hunting, interviews, and negotiating.
You’ll learn about all that in this session. We will also talk about how to get around a big obstacle for both women and men: how to get back to work after a long period of not working.
How can I get a database job with no experience? What’s the best way to learn the newest technology? What resources are out there? Bring your questions, and we’ll explore the answers.

# Managing ETL Change using BIMLScript
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Managing ETL Change using BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata?  Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data.  I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

# A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#867-Baton-Rouge-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: SQL Server Administration
## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Have you ever created an index and wondered what to specify for fill factor?  Usually I’ve never ever given it a worry and just left it at the default value = 0 (actually this is a synonym for 100).  But recently I’ve stumbled on a technique that will determine a “near” optimum fill factor value for every index in a database.  I say “near” because it won’t always derive the perfect fill factor, but will get you close.  We will look closely at the TSQL for this technique to see how the proof of concept was developed for a very active OLTP database.  I’ve observed a decrease in overall database wait times of 30% after the tuning.  The tuning is continuous and allows for changes in data skew as well as evolving application interactions with the database.  IMHO this is a real break-through for making your indexes perform even better.  All code will be available for download.

## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree
## Abstract:
### You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially
when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
 keep clustered index width small
 unique indexes perform better
 keep non-clustered index width small
 compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
 add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about
performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.

### The dust settles from the massive blow dealt by Erin's quick and, in your opinion, very creative thinking. A monster has been looming over your crew for weeks and it’s now on its last legs. All eyes make their way across the table and over to Jim, who is eager to roll the dice and deal the final blow. A final few clicks from the conference room mouse and the beast is felled. The room erupts in celebration as Jim logs into the new environment, spun up entirely by their efforts and investments in “Infrastructure as Code”.

As much as some might want to draw a line between work and play, there is much that they can have in common. In this session we'll take a look at what we, as people managers, can learn from role playing games and the relationship that evolves between a game master and their players. We'll talk about identifying what motivates our team members and tools and strategies we can employ to create an environment that keeps them challenged, interested, and engaged.

## Speaker: oscar garcia
## Title: Improve Dist`d System  Web App Performance Using In-Memory Cache
## Abstract:
### Applications often integrate with APIs for the purpose of retrieving data from a disk-based storage system like SQL Server. This poses challenges due slow queries and amount of data sent down the wire. In this presentation, we discuss the performance concerns with this type of architecture especially for big data scenarios.  Oscar Garcia shows how to address those concerns by following a series of steps in which an application is refactored with minimum changes to support an in-memory data store and data streaming.  We start by discussing the challenges when using data queries. We structure the data for in in-memory storage. We replace the API requests with real-time data streaming.

Learning Objectives:

SQL Server Query Challenges

Redis Cache Basic Operations and Structure

Angular App with Socket.io integration

Node.js Backend with Socket.io and Redis support

Real-time data integration
