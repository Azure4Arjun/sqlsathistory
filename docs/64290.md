## Title: Handling Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables can be slow, or require a lot of extra code to be effective. Fortunately, SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, also known as Temporal Tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to create temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples.
