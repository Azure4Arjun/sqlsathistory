## Title: How to Use Analytics (and Data Science) to Get a Promotion
## Abstract:
### Who has difficulty communicating the value of databases across their organization? Who wants to make more of a difference using database systems? Who is dissatisfied with their job and feels under-appreciated?

Welcome to my world. I've worked for years as a consultant, and I started in this situation, but I began making a living helping folks crawl their way out. Along the way, I got my Microsoft MVP, and I've helped many organizations make millions of more dollars through my consulting efforts. I'd like to help you, too.
