## Title: What Every DBA Should Know About NoSQL
## Abstract:
### NoSQL is one of the hot "new" things in the developer world. As DBAs inevitably someone will come to us for help or advice on (or possibly choosing) a NoSQL solution. This session aims to give you a basic understanding in order to best answer those questions for your organization.

In this presentation I will cover: What exactly NoSQL is (and is not), ACID compliance of some popular NoSQL solutions, main differences between traditional RDBMS and NoSQL, why NoSQL popular with developers, and when you might (or might not) want to leverage it for a solution.
