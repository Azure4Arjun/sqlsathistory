## Title: Periodic Table of DMVs: Collecting Baselines 
## Abstract:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In the first version of this presentation we discussed organization of the DMOs - this time around we're going to get our hands dirty and see how we can use them to collect baselines and plan for consolidations or migrations.
