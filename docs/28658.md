## Title: Build Your First SSIS Package 
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll take a top-down look at SQL Server Integration Services.  We'll start with an overview of SSIS and how it fits in with the rest of the SQL Server BI stack, followed by a quick tour of the components and tasks available in SSIS. Finally, we'll wrap up by demonstrating how to build and deploy a simple SSIS package from scratch.  This session is intended for those with little to no experience with SQL Server Integration Services.
