## Title: Natively Compiled T-SQL: The Fastest T-SQL Ever
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s In-Memory tables are accompanied by Natively Compiled Stored Procedures and Functions that run at amazing speed.  We'll:

•	Review in-memory tables
•	Look at the T-SQL language that can be used in Natively Compiled code
•	Discuss how transaction handling is different due to the use of optimistic concurrency
•	Recompile query plans as needed
•	Take a look at DMVs and extended events
•	Compare natively compiled functions to the alternatives forms

How the speed improvements are achieved is a fascinating topic.  We’ll take a look at the C code that SQL produces and uses as an intermediate step.  Somewhere in the C is the query plan and we will hunt for them.

If you want your application to be more than just fast, consider using Natively Compiled T-SQL.  It can make your database code run really, really fast.
