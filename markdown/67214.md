## Title: Best friends: SQL Server 2017, Python and Bitcoin!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 adds support for running in-database Python code. This is of course mainly meant for data science tasks, but in this session we'll concentrate on something far more interesting interesting and nerdy, that is Bitcoin!
