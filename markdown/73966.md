## Title: What SQL Server DBAs Need To Know About Distributed Availability
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of Distributed Availability Groups in SQL Server 2016, it is becoming even more confusing to decide on the appropriate high availability and disaster recovery architecture to implement. In this session, we will cover how Distributed Availability Groups work, how you need to think about them in a possible deployment scenario and how you can combine them with the other high availability and disaster recovery features to meet your database recovery objectives and service level agreements.
