## Title: Columnstore Clustered vs Nonclustered, when to choose what
## Abstract:
### The incredible Columnstore Indexes can increase your analytical query processing speed multiple times, they are updatable (Clustered from SQL Server 2014 and Nonclustered from SQL Server 2016 respectively), but they keep on supporting different sets of the functionalities â€“ such as CDC (Nonclustered Columnstore) and LOBs (Clustered Columnstore), and this brings a great confusion. 
This session will light up your path on when to use what functionality to use and when, even though sometimes one of the type of the Columnstore Indexes does not seems to appear as a default choice for your scenario.
