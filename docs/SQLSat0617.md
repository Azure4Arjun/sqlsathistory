# Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#617-Pensacola-2017)
Event Date: 03-06-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

# Testing SSIS Packages
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#617-Pensacola-2017)
Event Date: 03-06-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

## Title: Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI
## Abstract:
### For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.

## Title: A Rocket Scientist View on Indexes
## Abstract:
### Indexes can be a boon or decrement for query performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will concentrate with a deep dive into clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail and the scenarios they should be applied.  There will be many query demos illustrating index utilization using statistics and query plans.  Attendee should have some TSQL and Management Studio experience.

# Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#617-Pensacola-2017)
Event Date: 03-06-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 

Here you’ll learn:
• the most useful regular expression commands
• the appropriate times to use regular expressions
• how to use regular expressions to write code for you 
• how to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: Lighten Up: Soft Skills for Hardcore Techies
## Abstract:
### Your ideas are only as good as your ability to describe them to others.
 
As technology professionals, our tech skills need to be at their peak. However, we often lack the communication skills to describe technical concepts to others, including business users, executives, or even other technology professionals. In this session, veteran IT professional Mike Hillwig, will show you a handful of skills that are essential in communicating with people outside of the database world.
 
You will learn Mike's keys to good storytelling, making analogies, listening, writing, and putting technology concepts into things that give you a common language with business users. You'll leave this session with the ability to influence technology decisions based on your skills explaining why the DBA is usually right.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Autonomous Transaction Logging in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Autonomous/nested transactions are available in other database products, but are not natively supported in SQL Server. Fortunately there are several methods available to provide this functionality. 

We'll cover the standard table variable techniques to preserve data outside of transaction scope, and how the new in-memory table type can improve their performance.  Other techniques like user-defined events, CLR procedures, linked servers will also be demonstrated, and how they can enhance functionality.

We'll review minimal techniques like RAISERROR and the new SESSION_CONTEXT() feature in SQL Server 2016, to provide different levels of logging and transaction management.

# I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#617-Pensacola-2017)
Event Date: 03-06-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Christopher Sims
## Title: I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search
## Abstract:
### In this talk, we will explore two powerful technologies from the Microsoft Azure Stack: DocumentDB and Azure Search. DocumentDB is Microsoft's NoSQL service for building globally scalable schema-free applications. Azure Search allows you to integrate the power of Microsoft's search and natural language processing abilities to explore your complex data stores. During this talk we will cover the benefits of implementing a schema-free database, we will learn how to replicate your data at a global scale with the ease of a simple configuration and we will cover various techniques of querying that data using SQL and the DocumentDB API. Once we have a large datastore in place (we will use 200k+ Jeopardy questions), we will apply the powerful natural language querying capabilities and faceted search features of Azure Search to quickly create an searchable data repository. All of this will be built and exposed using a cross-platform application built in Angular on the Electron framework.
