## Title: SQL Server and Big Data Projects in the Real World
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will skip past the Big Data 101 introductions and talk to you about specific Big Data projects that I have been involved with and how we've used Big Data technologies including Hadoop, MongoDB, Cassandra and Aster Data with SQL Server to create complex Big Data Analytics solutions. I've implemented solutions for Microsoft, Razorfish and Pentaho in this space and we're going to talk about solution architectures.
