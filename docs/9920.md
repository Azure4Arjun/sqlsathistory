## Title: Using Apache Solr with SQL for Text Searching
## Abstract:
### Big Data is quickly becoming THE thing to do.  Even Microsoft is getting in on the game with HDInsight and Azure.  In this session we will cover how to use Apache Solr, a Lucene based Open Source search engine, to provide text indexing and search capabilities and how to integrate it with SQL Server.  Not only can Solr provide a full range of indexing and search features, but it can also be used to help improve performance of some queries commonly used in SQL Server by offloading them to Solr (the ubiquitous field search procedures as one example).

The session will cover some basics about how Solr works, starting and customizing Solr, indexing documents, search features, and how to integrate with SQL Server.
