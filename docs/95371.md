## Title: Docker for DBAs
## Abstract:
### In the past five years there has been an explosive increase in Docker adoption.  However, uptake has been slow among data professionals.  DBAs are naturally wary of Docker's stateless and transient paradigm.  In this session we'll discuss what Docker is, how SQL Server uses it, Docker deployment strategies in Azure, and when using Docker does and doesn't make sense.
