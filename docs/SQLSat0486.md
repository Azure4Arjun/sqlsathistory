# Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Design and Architecture
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

# Solving the Data Integration Problem for Non-Developers with Power Query
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Solving the Data Integration Problem for Non-Developers with Power Query
## Abstract:
### Self-service business intelligence (BI) technologies have gained popularity in the past few years. They often highlight how easy data exploration and fancy data visualizations are, but leave out the most expensive and time-consuming part of the process: preparing and integrating the data. Why? Perhaps because most self-service technologies fall short when pulling together information that is drawn from multiple systems.

In this session, learn how  businesses and IT can use Power Query--a free data integration tool and part of Power BI--to transform, combine, and share data from heterogeneous data sources, reducing the time and cost to prepare the data that is used to produce analysis and reports. We also discuss how Power Query fits in the larger BI landscape and the considerations and concerns that IT stakeholders have when adopting this type of self-service technology.

## Speaker: Carlos L Chacon
## Title: If You Build It, They Will Come--Creating Your Own Opportunities!
## Abstract:
### Often times we might feel like we are simply spinning our wheels and can't seem to move ahead.  Perhaps we see others getting opportunities and can't quite place why more doesn't come our way.  This session will discuss how we can put ourselves in the drivers seat when it comes to making opportunities so we can make some decisions about what we want to do rather than choosing from what is left.

## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances, yet still don't get all the objects. Even using SSDT, not all objects are exported and live at the server level, above the database. 
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and/or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance or for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Creds, SSIS Packages, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports with a Visual Schedule, a Server Security Checkup , a Hardware Inventory, Linked Servers, Server Triggers and DBMail settings.

## Speaker: Slava Murygin
## Title: New SQL Server 2016 Feature: "Query Store"
## Abstract:
### Do you have  any SQL Server monitoring tool in your production environment?
If so, what would you do when you find a trouble-making query?
Do you write a request to software developers to tune it?

In SQL Server 2016 you have an option not only monitor worst performing queries, but also decide how they have to be executed in your system. You can look at different query plans and force SQL Server to use the quickest one or one which uses less memory or IO.

During that session we will go through major new features of SQL Server 2016 and nail down the "Query Store".

You will learn about that new SQL Server feature and maybe you find how it would  help you in your current production environment.

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Azure / Cloud / Big Data
## Speaker: Azhagappan Arunachalam
## Title: Getting to know U-SQL
## Abstract:
### With so many languages around to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize data, Microsoft introduced yet another language : U-SQL.  In this session, we'll take a look at what U-SQL is, what it brings to the table, and how it differs from (or overlaps with) the existing constructs (T-SQL, SQL CLR, DAX/MDX, PowerQuery/M, R etc.,).  We'll go over step-by-step in getting started with U-SQL, and review some use case scenarios.

# Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration, Deployment, Monitoring
## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

# Optimizing Protected Indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Performance
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Optimizing Protected Indexes
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

# Introduction to Partitioning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Design and Architecture
## Speaker: Tom Staab
## Title: Introduction to Partitioning
## Abstract:
### We all know that a smaller table is generally faster to retrieve data from than a larger one. What if you could split your very large table into a set of smaller tables but still query and manage them as if they were 1 table? Would that improve your query performance? In this session, we'll examine table partitioning and how it works under the covers to do just that. I'll demonstrate how to configure and manage partitioning (including the magic of SWITCH and sliding windows) and give some examples showing the performance benefits.  Finally, we'll take a look at partitioned views and compare/contrast those with partitioned tables.

# Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#486---Richmond-2016)
Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Virtualization
## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!

## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: TempDB 101 Plus
## Abstract:
### TempDB is not your ordinary user database and should definitely not be treated like one.  The usage patterns dictate that the configuration, monitoring and usage be done in a different way to get the best performance. We will see why aspects such as configuration and file placement play such a key role and why you need to plan ahead for TempDB.  See how to detect the memory and space usage associated with the various users in TempDB along with some of the most common performance related scenarios that you will encounter with a well-used TempDB database.  In addition we will explain the differences between temp tables and table variables and when to use one over another.
