## Title: Policy Based Management â€“manage consistency
## Abstract:
### Have you found yourself tasked with managing settings and environment definitions across a large pool of SQL Server 2008 servers and felt overwhelmed with where to start? Do changes in your environment go unnoticed and have a ripple effect within your application stack? Do you find developers and others not following standards time and time again even with the best process definitions and promises in place? Then you will benefit from understanding a powerful feature tucked neatly within SQL Server 2008; Policy Based Management. I will provide a clean overview of this management tool along with some demonstrations that help explain its usage in action.
