## Title: The Things You Don't Think About...
## Abstract:
### As developers of data driven applications, we spend a lot of time thinking about performance. We read articles on how to best index, or how to how to write a better query. We make trial runs and analyze them using Show Plan. We read still other articles on using views, versus functions, versus stored procs. We learn patterns to write the most maintainable code. The list goes on…. But what about the things we don’t think about?From DMV’s to lesser talked about new features, The building blocks we code on haveall sorts of things going on that we all too often either don’t know or don’t think about. In this session, we’ll take a somewhat random stroll around data development and topics that you may not know about, or may simply have not thought about in a while, and examine what they mean to your code maintainability or performance.
