## Title: Making reports in SSRS: beyond standard tools
## Abstract:
### Reporting Services is used by years as the main tool to create and delivery reports for SQL Server data platform users.
But although we are accostumed to use it, there are many tips and tricks that can help us to significantly improve the output we produce. For example:
- writing custom function to perform non-standard actions or to create personalized charts
- export multiple sheets in Excel
- dealing with merge cells when exporting in Excel
- using interactive and dynamics filters inside a report
- creating alternate rows backgrounds in tables or matrix
The release of SQL Server 2016 introduced support for R, the most common and powerful analytical and statistical language.
With R inside SQL Server itâ€™s possible to embed R charts straight into Reporting Services, exploiting countless opportunities offered by the powerful graphic libraries shipped into the language.
