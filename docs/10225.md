## Title: SMO Internals for High Performance Automation
## Abstract:
### Ever wanted to know what happens behind the scenes in SQL Server when automating your maintenance work?  How fast can your automation really go? I will take you through a few common objects in SMO and the internals of what happens when you use those objects. We will examine the TSQL that is generated, and learn techniques that lead to high efficiency.  Combining the flexibility of PowerShell and SMO Internals is a recipe for awesome sauce. Come to learn about the knobs available to tune your SMO automations.  PowerShell will be used as the vehicle that leverages SMO. Come see this demo-heavy session, you'll be glad you did.
