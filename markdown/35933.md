## Title: Rock Your Technical Interview (Part 2)
## Abstract:
### Have you ever not gotten a job due to not being prepared for the technical interview? Do you want a big raise? I've interviewed 100's of software developers and will share my knowledge on how to survive, what we look for and even divulge some of the secrets we use during the process. This session will include advice from hiring managers, recruiters and engineers that were recently hired at a new company! Maybe some crazy interview stories for fun.
