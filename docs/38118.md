## Title: PowerShell - Jump from simple scripts to advanced functions
## Abstract:
### Have you ever thought to take your PowerShell scripts to the next level? And if by doing so they become more robust and reusable?
In this session we will convert a simple PowerShell script in an advanced function and we will explore what we gain with this transformation.

Among others we will see how: 
 - Create / import modules from functions; 
 - Take advantage of: 
    - Input by pipeline; 
    - Common parameters to cmdlets as "Verbose", "-ErrorAction" and "-WarningAction"; 
    - Risk mitigation parameters as "-WhatIf" and "-Confirm"; 
    - Help

We will also see in action a set of functions that are designed to automate and save time on real cases of everyday life of a DBA.
