## Title: Intro to C# for the SSIS Script Component
## Abstract:
### The Script Component is an extremely powerful element in SSIS because it brings in the full capability of the .NET Framework.  With first-class development tools and languages like C# you can solve problems that previously required very complex SQL or Expressions.  If you'd like to learn enough C# to more effectively use the Script Component for Transformations, then this session is for you.
