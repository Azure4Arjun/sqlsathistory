## Title: Who needs numbers? Enhance your data models and dashboards with Non-Numeric measures
## Abstract:
### We don't really think of putting text, date or boolean values in the measures of our pivot tables or on our dashboards, but after this session, hopefully you will. 

Enhance the functionality of your SSAS Tabular and PowerBI output, by understanding HOW-, WHY- and WHEN to leverage the power of DAX to create non-numeric measures, and see how you can quickly help business answer a number of different questions, by thinking differently about where measures start and end.
