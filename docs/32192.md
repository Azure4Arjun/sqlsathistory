## Title: SQL Query Optimization - It's Not Rocket Science!
## Abstract:
### Writing a query optimizer that produces a great execution plan for every SQL query, on every database, with every hardware configuration, is a hard problem. A really hard problem. Luckily, few of us will be called upon to write an optimizer. On the other hand, most of us have to make use of the SQL Server query optimizer in our everyday work. To write queries that will optimize well, it helps to have a good understanding of how the optimizer translates T-SQL code into an executable plan and how to read those plans. Come to this session and learn how to take full advantage of the optimizer's powerful features, how to avoid some of its limitations, and how to leverage the wealth of information contained in SQL Server's execution plans.
