## Title: Practical SQL query monitoring and optimization
## Abstract:
### Today the project owners demand results as soon as possible and most often - for yesterday. Time to market is crucial and it is practical to deliver bit-by-bit, get feedback and grow with the number of your customers. But as the project grows, the team does too and not all have the same expertise. As well rarely in the beginning the requirements clear enough to allow performance-wise SQL interaction.
In most cases there does not exist an ORM that can solve this task for you and you will need to have hard T-SQL writer in the team. If you already know this story or are going this way then in this practical session we will share how to monitor, measure and optimize your SQL code and DB layer interaction.
