## Title: The Guts of Data Manipulation
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Query Processor does a great job hiding all the dirty work necessary to display, store, modify, and delete data. When designing, coding, or tuning, however, knowing what’s happening under the hood can be the difference between fast and fail. In this demo-heavy deep-dive session, we’ll follow the query processor as it rips through a database and discover the steps it takes to deliver the results of your queries.
