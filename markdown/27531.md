## Title: Inside of Indexes
## Abstract:
### We will navigate through the internal differences between Clustered and non-Clustered indexes. Will take a look how indexes are built, what page splits are and how SQL Server uses indexes to retrieve a data. In that session we will use DBCC IND and DBCC PAGE and dig into pages' binary code. That is Intermediate session for everybody who already knows about indexes, but doesn't really know how they work.
