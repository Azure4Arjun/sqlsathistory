## Title: An Entity Framework Crash Course for the Busy DBA.
## Abstract:
### The Entity Framework enables developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects and properties, without having to concern themselves with the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With such great power comes great frustration; Namely our Database Administrators' as they trace through and attempt to optimize the Entity Framework auto-generated SQL statements hitting our databases.

This talk aims to empower the DBA with an understanding of the architecture behind the Entity Framework and the most common pitfalls programmers fall for when attempting to rapidly write data access layer code using the Entity Framework and what can be done to overcome them.
