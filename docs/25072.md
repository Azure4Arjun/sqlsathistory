Event Date: 22-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Richard  Munn
## Title: Policy-based what ? (Or how I learned to stop worrying and love PBM)
## Abstract:
### Beginning with SQL Server 2008, Policy-based Management was added to the DBAs toolkit to ease administration, but it only goes so far. This session will cover the principles of PBM, and we'll take a look at how we can make it *work* for us, as opposed to just telling us something is not right. We'll cover PBM and it's insides, Alerts, Operators, Scheduled Jobs, and demo a real-world use when setting up databases.
