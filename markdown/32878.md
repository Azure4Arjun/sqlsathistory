## Title: Join operations - Explaining Merge,Hash and Loop 
## Abstract:
### In this session weâ€™ll  look in depth at the three main types of join operations (Nested Loops, Hash and Merge)  in order to understand how query plans are computed. We will look at the performance of Hash and Merge joins in different scenarios and explain why they are sometimes associated with poor performing queries.
