## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Real-Time Reporting through the medium of Dance
## Abstract:
### The modern data warehouse proposition has to deliver data at much greater velocities than we were previously able to. This is known as the speed layer in lambda architecture parlance.

But how do you start putting a real-time streaming dashboard together? For the first time, it's actually straightforward to achieve. This session will run through an example streaming application, taking live statistics from a dance-mat game through to a live dashboard. We'll go from scanning log files, pushing messages to an Event Hub, through Streaming Analytics into a live PowerBI Streaming Dashboard.

This demo-heavy, practical session will tell you all you need to know to get started with real-time reporting with Microsoft Azure.
