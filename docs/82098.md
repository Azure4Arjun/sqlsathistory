Event Date: 28-07-2018 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: QA/Automation
## Speaker: Stephen Mokszycki
## Title: DevOps Database administration.
## Abstract:
### How outsource administrative tasks to your end user groups in a safe, secure, and repeatable pattern.   Now you no longer have to pause and stop what you are doing to create that new login, and replicate it to your Disaster Recovery.   You do not have to stop and perform a backup/restore to refresh the development environment.  Empower your end users, let them do this on their own without compromising your security.

There will be a demo!
