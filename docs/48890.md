## Title: Optimizing your data warehouse for OLAP Processing
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services have become a major part of upper management daily decision making activities.  However, with our DW sizes reaching multiple terabytes minimizing time required to process our data has become our top priority. In this session, we will cover the options we have as DBAâ€™s to improve the performance of our DW processing time. We will look at features and general best practices available to us within SSAS and the database engine to ensure optimal performance, as well as enterprise level features within the database engine and SSAS available to us and how aligning those to work side by side would yield us significant improvement in our processing time.
