## Title: Loading a Partitioned Fact Table using SSIS 2012.
## Abstract:
### Get in-depth knowledge and architectural guidance on modeling, governing and managing large data sets through the use of Partitioned Tables and how to load and manage them. Learn an effective ETL architecture, strategy and tactics to support:

24x7 business intelligence availability with no data warehouse "down-time" for data loading
Supporting complex, multi-column partition schemes with given the current single-column limitation on partitioning functions
Partition loading and switching with minimal impact on user activity (queries)
High-performance business intelligence solutions by leveraging ColumnStore indexes on partitioned tables
Updating partitioned table with ColumnStore Indexes given the current read-only limitation on tables with ColumnStore indexes
Use SQL Server Integration Services as purely a orchestration tool for these processes
Leverage SQL Server Management Objects to deliver a set of robust methods for a more flexible ETL architecture
