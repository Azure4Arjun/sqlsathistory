## Title: Tapping into the Power of Data Flows in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI has changed the landscape when it comes to Analytics and Reporting.  With the introduction of Power BI Data Flows, we've opened up the capabilities of doing light weight ETL work, internal to Power BI allowing for your Report writers and analysts to reuse the work done by others to make your development process more productive.  In this session, we will cover the internals of Data Flows and work through demos on how to setup your first Data Flow to generate a usable model for your reporting needs.
