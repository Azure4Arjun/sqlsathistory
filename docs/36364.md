## Title: Azure Machine Learning - drag, drop, predict
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (AML) changes the way we work with data and what knowledge and skills are required in order to predict outcome of future events.  AML is a comprehensive “drag, drop, predict” technology with all the benefits of the cloud.  The transfer of machine learning to the new platform with ability to use R programming language makes common machine learning tasks very simple for the different customers and academic community.
