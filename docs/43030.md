## Speaker: Seth Washeck
## Title: VLT Shootout
## Abstract:
### You have large tables. I have large tables.  What can we do with them? How can we architect them in a way that allows for best performance? In this session we'll discuss the thought/theory behind some common suggestions, address some common misconceptions (I'm looking at you, incremental statistics, and partitioning), and see if we can validate the theories that underpin the suggestions at the individual query level, and at a proposed workload level.  Suggestions covered include: Partitioned Views, Partitioning, Incremental Statistics, Filtered Indexes, Filtered Statistics, and Columnstore indexes.
