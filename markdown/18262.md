## Speaker: Kevan Riley
## Title: Tempdb - a database developer's perspective
## Abstract:
### Ask the internet for help when you have a performance issue with tempdb and you will find a slew of articles on how to configure and setup tempdb on your server, how many files to use, where to place them on the disk subsystem, even what hardware to use.  But what if you are a developer, with no access or control over the configuration of the server. In this session Kevan explains what tempdb is and what it is used for and leading on from that how you can, through development approaches, control how you use it.  The usage of tempdb will go hand-in-hand with the overall performance of your queries, so do not be surprised if you learn how to make your queries fly at the same time.
