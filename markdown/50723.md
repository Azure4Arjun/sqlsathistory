## Title: Cluster@#$%!  SQL Server Failover Clusters. What Could Go Wrong?
## Abstract:
### The more clustered they are, the harder they fall. Sometimes. And sometimes, nobody notices anything happened at all. 

Whether you're having to design your first SQL Server failover cluster implementation, or have inherited a cluster built in the long, long ago before there was a historic record (or server manifest), join John Harp on an adventure through some of the most noteworthy failures a SQL cluster can encounter.
