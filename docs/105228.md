## Title: Case Study: How I used SharePoint, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Forms to build a Speaker Database
## Abstract:
### In this case study, I detail how I went about designing and implementing a Speaker Database for the Project Management Institute using SharePoint, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Microsoft Forms. We will do a brief intro of what each technology is and it's pros and cons, and then dive into what I learned about each, each strengths and weaknesses, and how I was able to build a functional Speaker Database.
