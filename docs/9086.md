## Title: 45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about SSAS Tabular, maybe even know a couple things about it, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure out how to develop one together yourself? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying.
