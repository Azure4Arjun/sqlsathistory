## Title: Demo of Red Gate SQL Backup (MINI)
## Abstract:
### Thought about trying a third party backup tool but haven't found the time? Looking for some insight from someone that has used it to see if it works as well as the advertising says it does? In this mini presentation Kendal Van Dyke will discuss installing and using SQL Backup by Red Gate. Great session to get a better look at what this product has to offer.
