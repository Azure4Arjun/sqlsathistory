## Speaker: Anthony Sammartino
## Title: Self-Service Visualization with Power View
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give a brief history of Self-Service Visualization and some tools out there today that facilitate it. I will then introduce Power View and the two ways it can be used; SharePoint 2010 (or 2013) and now Excel 2013. I will then cover what sources can be used to create a Power View report then jump into a demo and create a few visualizations from a blank canvas to demonstrate how easy, yet powerful this visualization tool really is. I will also show the SSAS Tabular model that houses the data for the Power View reports and will enhance it as part of the session to make Power View shine.
