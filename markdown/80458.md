## Title: Policies are not just for HR
## Abstract:
### The use of SQL Server Policies can make a DBAs life much easier.  Nearly anything you need to track can be monitored with policies.  When something changes you will be notified.  Save hours and hours of looking at configurations or building your own monitoring database.  Set a policy and apply it all SQL Servers.
