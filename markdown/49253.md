## Speaker: Robert Biddle
## Title: .NET for Data Professionals
## Abstract:
### Are you a DBA who knows nothing or very little about .NET? It's a more common than you might think, but most DBA's cringe at the thought of seeing C# code. Still, there are a lot of gems in this tried and tested toolbox. In this session, we'll cover the portions of .NET that are useful for any data professional. If you're into database development, administration, or ETL - .NET has some useful implementations that you can leverage easily.

No .NET experience is needed for this session. Basic understanding of programming concepts such as if/then logic and loops is suggested.
