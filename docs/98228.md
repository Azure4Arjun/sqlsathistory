## Speaker: Michael Curry
## Title: Theory Driven Data Science: Cyber-security Improvement using SQL, R and machine learning [Video]
## Abstract:
### Data science seeks to uncover actionable data relationships  to solve pressing organizational needs e.g. improved cyber security behavior, and this talk presents three steps for doing just that. The aim  is an exemplary theory driven approach to data evidence of better preparedness against cybersecurity threats. We will present a theory of cybersecurity behavior and how data was collected from training participants then stored in SQL server for analysis in R with a ML classifier. The ML random forest classifier implemented in R is used to analyze survey responses to theoretically-inspired questions. It creates a preferred multi-model integration that can be reused on future data to identify the individuals less likely to participate in the security training who may also be a higher security risk. The talk concludes by summarizing the three tips for actionable data science projects covered here. A short video will preview for SQL Saturday attendees.
