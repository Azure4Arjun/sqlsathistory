## Title: Performance Optimization with Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### The cloud is just using someone else's compute. You still need to care about and optimize for performance.  Just as a dropped call frustrates cellular customers, an app with data issues, high latency, connection timeouts will create the same frustration for users.  Do you want to catch the performance issues before your customers?  Do you want to automatically identify database issues and quickly drill down into details? Azure provides built in tools just to do that. 
In this session I will show you 4 of those tools.  You will learn how these tools can provide Performance overview of a database and recommendations that can improve workload performance.  Find top resource consuming queries, deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption and learn when to let Azure  automatically optimize your database. 
 
At the end of this session you will walk out knowing how to identify and tune Azure SQL database performance  issues with built in tools in Azure Portal.
