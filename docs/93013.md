## Title: ElasticSearch - A look at the ELK stack and visualizing data with Canvas
## Abstract:
### My company uses a NoSQL style database engine. As such we have no access to standard database functions like relational queries. To get around this we built an ElasticSearch caching layer on top of our database to make complex queries, but we got so much more than just a caching layer by choosing ElasticSearch.

In this talk we will cover a variety of out of the box features you get with ElasticSearch, why ElasticSearch is so popular, and what it can do for your company, even if you don't have the type of database handicaps a noSQL install might create.
