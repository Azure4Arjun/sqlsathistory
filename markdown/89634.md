## Title: Stretch DB – Moving your SQL Server Database to the Cloud One Record at a Time
## Abstract:
### Ok… so maybe it is 9,999 records at a time. New with SQL Server 2016, this technology allows a hybrid way to separate their cold and hot data with minimal code changes. 

Clark will share his real world experience with trying to implement Stretch DB as well as a demonstration of the setup using both the wizard and T-SQL scripts.
