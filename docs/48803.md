## Title: Smart Rats Leave First
## Abstract:
### Rats leave a sinking ship.  Smart rats leave first.  Changing jobs is always going to be stressful, but it can be a great opportunity for career growth.  Recognizing when it is time to make a change can be the difference between taking a step up on the career ladder or having to find a "lifeboat" job.  We will discuss how to recognize when it is time to move on, how to manage your job search and your current job, and finally how to exit a job professionally.
