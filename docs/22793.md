## Title: Dynamically Increase your Data Awareness
## Abstract:
### Data Profiling is a vital step that is often overlooked in the development process. Integration Services (SSIS) built-in support for data profiling is limited and takes manual user intervention. Learn a new approach to automate data profiling and increase your data awareness. 
In this session we will walk through a framework that dynamically develops a group of packages that can profile data based on the existing metadata within your current environment. By dynamically tracking the metadata within your environment, you can easily maintain your data monitoring solution. This will enable a more thorough view of your ETL environment that will allow you to spot issues faster and create a more scaled infrastructure based on your current performance needs.
