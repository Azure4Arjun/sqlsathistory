## Title: When GEO meets SQL: Hotwiring Data to Locations
## Abstract:
### Spatial fields, operators, and functions were introduced in SQL 2008. I will detail how these can be integrated with location-based information in existing data warehouses and marts - and on the cheap. We will briefly discuss the basics (geometry versus geography, geocoding), then move on to the common problems with this task and the remedies.
