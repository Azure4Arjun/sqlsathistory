## Title: Data is all around - so how do you control it? â€‹
## Abstract:
### Data is all around. And as the value of data has become clear for most businesses, they are eager to start using it to get better insights. Still, as the sources, users and need for data increases, the job to ensure that your data is used the way it was intended throughout the company becomes challenging. How do you enable your business to take full advantage of your data?

In this session, I will present how data governance and particularly the augmented data catalog can tackle this issue. In addition, we will have a look at how such a data catalog can act as a tool for the developers. How it can help bridge the gap between the business and the developer. And also why Gartner believes that an augmented data catalog is a key component for data lake projects to deliver value.
