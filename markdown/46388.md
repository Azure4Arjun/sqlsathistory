## Title: Hadoop for the SQL Server Developer/DBA
## Abstract:
### Are you new to Hadoop?  In this beginner-friendly (but technical) session you'll learn about  the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and Microsoft HDInsight from the ground up with a focus on what SQL Server professionals like yourself need to know.  

We will go into technical detail about what HDFS, MapReduce and YARN/Tez actually are  how they work. Then you'll discover the Hadoop ecosystem and the myriad of projects within. We'll see demos of how Hive complements the traditional relational database world, and discuss real-world data tasks/use cases that Hadoop can accomplish.
