## Title: SQL Server 2012 in Virtualization World
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is one of the most commonly virtualized application.  In order for SQL Server to run well in a virtual environment, the virtualized host must be properly configured and managed.  We will discuss some of the benefits of virtualization that particularly apply to virtualized SQL Server environments which include: easier failover, hardware abstraction and simpler capacity planning.  This session will demonstrate how to setup SQL Server storage in a virtual environment as well as best practices, caveats, and performance of SQL Server database.
