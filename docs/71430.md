## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Analysis Services for the Absolute Beginner
## Abstract:
### Publications across the globe have called “data the new oil.”  However, the value of oil is what the oil can be turned into.  Similarly, the value in data is in what you derive from it, not the data itself.

Regardless of the title you carry, DBA, developer, report writer, ETL developer, manager etc., now is the time to make an acquaintance of Analysis Services.  Come, join in as we define basic terms, investigate a few uses cases and see some simple examples.  You will soon see that if data is the new oil, Analysis Services, on-premises or in the cloud, is a key component in the new refinery.
