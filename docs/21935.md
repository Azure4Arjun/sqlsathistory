## Speaker: Peter Avenant
## Title: VARIGENCE AUSTRALIA - Build an Integrated Metadata Framework
## Abstract:
### Using a live-typing approach, Peter will briefly show the overall structure of a Biml file and the core syntax patterns. Then he will demonstrate how the power of BimlScript is amplified by the availability of rich metadata sources to drive the automatic creation of your solution. 

Peter will demonstrate a flexible and reusable framework for storing and managing the metadata that you will use as an input to your BimlScripts. We will bring it together with a walking through a fully featured production framework and the code it generates.

Please refer to the technical walkthrough for more information.
