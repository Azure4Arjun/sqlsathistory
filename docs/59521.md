## Title: Surviving parsing XML with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Oft times we as developers are required to create queries to extract data from our tables that is fortunately or unfortunately in XML format and deeply layered at that.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking at varied techniques to materialize our data (from XML format) in an efficient and effective manner. We shall begin by tackling the subject within Management Studio and then progress to SQL Server Integration Services and SQL Server Reporting Services. The presentation is based upon true case scenarios and will show many of the pitfalls or gotchaâ€™s of which to be wary.
