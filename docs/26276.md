## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Fundamentals of Join Operations
## Abstract:
### This is a wonderful session for those that don't yet grok the three types of joins available to the SQL Server engine or the scenarios for which each join type is optimal. All will be explained here with some very slick visual demonstrations of internal data flow as well as TSQL code samples.  We will also show how bad performance can get when suboptimal joins are used.
