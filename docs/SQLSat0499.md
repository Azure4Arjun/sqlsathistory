# XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#499-Madison-2016)
Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Adam Belebczuk
## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

# The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server vNext
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#499-Madison-2016)
Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server vNext
## Abstract:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change how you tune and troubleshoot performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need to apply it to your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts as well as your Azure SQL Databases.

# Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#499-Madison-2016)
Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. For example, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed.
 
This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use both some undocumented and more commonly known commands to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Rob Long
## Title: Getting More from Analysis Services – Writing Data Back
## Abstract:
### Excel power users have become accustomed to pivot tables displaying data from an Analysis Services Cube.  What happens when they want to “tweek” things in what-if-analysis or make future projections?  SSAS writeback measure groups allow for these scenarios.

In this demo-centric session we’ll see what it takes to setup and use a writeback enabled measure group.  We will work through a specific but simple business use-case to help reinforce the overall process.

## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: SQL Server Hybrid Cloud Strategy: Best Of Both Worlds With On-Prem + Cloud
## Abstract:
### For years it seemed that the only message SQL Server professionals were hearing was "to the Cloud.... you must get to the Cloud!". However, if you work in a highly regulated industry, or one simply averse to change, this likely was not an option for you. The good news is, Microsoft heard your feedback and has been busy incorporating Cloud connectivity, compatibility, and functionality into the box product.

Come spend the hour with me and you’ll learn how to leverage the power of the Cloud with your on-premises SQL Server install. We’ll cover backup and restore options with Windows Azure Storage, using Windows Azure VMs for high availability, how to store your data files in Windows Azure Storage, and more.  We’ll start with SQL Server 2012 and work our way up to the most recently released bits for SQL Server 2016.  You can have the best of both worlds with a SQL Server Hybrid Cloud strategy!

## Speaker: Ben Miller
## Title: Be Friendly to SQL Server with TSQL Best Practices
## Abstract:
### TSQL is a necessity when interacting with SQL Server so knowing can be half the battle. Performance is always good as the database starts to grow, but building in resilience when you begin is a greater advantage than refactoring. I will go over 5 key things to know when you write TSQL, use DataTypes and/or variables in comparisons and you will also learn about the procedure cache and how to avoid pitfalls there. This is a beginners session but the concepts in this session are a great foundation to begin with. If you are looking for a solid foundation to build on and need the basics to start, this session is definitely for you.

# Data Migration Using BIML
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#499-Madison-2016)
Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Data Migration Using BIML
## Abstract:
### Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.

## Speaker: Colleen Morrow
## Title: Enterprise Auditing with SQL Server Audit
## Abstract:
### Audit. The very word strikes fear in the bravest of hearts. But as a DBA, the need to know who is doing what in your production databases is critical.  In SQL Server 2008, Microsoft finally gave us a true auditing tool. But how does it work, what exactly can it track, and how can you handle its output? 

In this session, we cover SQL Server Audit from the ground up. We go from the basics of which events can be audited to a look at how SQL Server Audit works "under the covers", and what that means for performance. While implementing server and database audits, we discuss audit granularity and filtering, as well as the pros and cons of Audit's output options.

Whether it's through the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) interface, via T-SQL, or using PowerShell and Server Management Objects (SMO), at the end of this session you'll be able to deploy SQL Server Audit across your enterprise and manage its output, fearlessly.

# Objective SQL Server Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#499-Madison-2016)
Event Date: 09-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Objective SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### “It’s slow! FIX IT!” is not a fun way to walk into the office on a Monday morning. However, putting objective metrics to the subjectivity of ‘slow’ is as much a science as it is art. Performance engineering takes effort well before an issue arises. Collecting the right metrics, trending and comparing against an established baseline, and identifying bottlenecks are all part of the performance process. This interactive session will help the DBA fine-tune their performance tuning approach so that the foundation for long-term proactive performance review is in place. The DBA can then shift the job responsibilities from a reactive response to a more predictive and proactive role.
