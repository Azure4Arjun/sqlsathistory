## Title: Dynamic code for efficient searching 
## Abstract:
### Illustrate how multipurpose queries can lead to issues with scalability and performance. Show a few alternatives that will work for smaller and simpler queries while highlighting their limitations for more complex queries. Then work through building a dynamic search query to resolve the identified performance issues. Touching on: • Testing. • Tuning each part of the query in isolation. • Plan cache re-use • Security – SQL injection attacks and authorisation / code signing. • Possibly, mentioning greater re-use and extendibility.
