## Title: Finding more space for your tight environment.
## Abstract:
### If you do not have enough disk space and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I am going use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defrag the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.
