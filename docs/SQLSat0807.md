# Everlasting Issues with Temporary Tables and tempdb
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#807-Redmond-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: Everlasting Issues with Temporary Tables and tempdb
## Abstract:
### Tempdb has been a source of configuration confusion since the very first version of SQL Server. Each SQL Server instance only has one tempdb database used by all users in all databases. In this session, we’ll look at all the different uses of tempdb and how to configure your tempdb to support them. We’ll look at all the different kinds of temporary tables and see when you should use each type. We’ll talk about the difference between global and local temp tables, table variables and work tables. We’ll explore the various tools available that let you monitor the use (and abuse) of your tempdb database and we look at some best practice guidelines for how to keep your tempdb as healthy as possible.

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Swagatika Sarangi
## Title: Why Solidity is Solid – Basics of Ethereum, Smart Contracts, and Blockchain.
## Abstract:
### If you are into Ethereum or any latest Blockchain platform you may know the availability of “smart contract language (SCL)” comes easily. In this foundational quick talk, I will be introducing my audiences to a newer coding platform in Blockchain. We know that any RELATIONAL language/platform is legacy and solid when it comes to prevalence. But if you are open to experiment and broaden your understanding to a Blockchain world with the new-cutting-age-y languages, feel free to join my session. 
Topics that I will cover in this session – 
1.	What is Ethereum Blockchain (A, B, Cs of it.)
2.	Overview of NEO platform  Solidity language
3.	What are ‘Smart Contracts’
4.	Python, C++ Vs Solidity, Language of Smart Contract
5.	Last but not least, if you attend my session and do NOT understand ‘a thing’ I am speaking; you will still get a ton of ‘reference materials’ that I have been gaining from many over-priced Blockchain courses conducted by multi-millionaires, geeks.

# Better Query Performance from Proper Statistics Management
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#807-Redmond-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: Better Query Performance from Proper Statistics Management
## Abstract:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

# A Beginner's Guide To Plan Guides
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#807-Redmond-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brian Carrig
## Title: A Beginner's Guide To Plan Guides
## Abstract:
### Even with the increased simplicity of plan forcing using Query Data Store in SQL Server 2016 and above, plan guides remain a very powerful but often overlooked feature of SQL server. There is a misconception in the community that plan guides are really only useful for situations where the DBA "cannot change the code" but actually plan guides have much broader applicability than simply fixing problems with poorly designed ISV code. However, for the DBA, working with plan guides can often be a confusing and frustrating experience. 

In this session we will cover what plan guides are, how they work and demonstrate scenarios where they can be successfully used to solve a number of problems DBAs experience on a day to day basis.

# T-SQL Habits and Practices That Can Kill Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#807-Redmond-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: T-SQL Habits and Practices That Can Kill Performance
## Abstract:
### All too often we are on a project or given a task where the time or financial constraints require us to develop T-SQL “quick-and-dirty”. Or maybe we have been tasked with quickly improving the performance of some existing T-SQL. These situations often lead to code that later needs to be tuned for better performance. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could satisfy those tight time constraints while also avoiding many of the pitfalls that later plague performance?
In this session we will see ten common T-SQL writing habits that contribute to poor performance. We’ll see WHY each of these patterns can have such negative impact on performance, including examples, and we’ll see one or more alternatives for each that don’t have the same negative impact.
Armed with this knowledge, you will definitely impress your boss with your ability to create fast T-SQL within tight time constraints, and also quickly fix existing T-SQL code. Enjoy the merit raise you’ll get due to your new tuning talents.

## Speaker: Reid Havens
## Title: Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Failing to deliver a well-designed Power BI Report can be a common reporting pitfall.  What good is quality data if it is not presented in a way that is meaningful or easily understood? Someone without any prior knowledge should be able to quickly understand a report without explanation and be quickly drawn to the key elements you want them to view.  This talk will walk through many elements of bad report design. Learn about visual cues and how certain chart types can convey data more accurately than others. Also, learn about the basic dos and don’ts of report design and layout, using easy-to-learn techniques that bring data to life.

# Protect Your SQL Server Data with Static Data Masking
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#807-Redmond-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Greg Larsen
## Title: Protect Your SQL Server Data with Static Data Masking
## Abstract:
### Are you providing adequate protection to your sensitive and confidential data? I’m sure we all do our best to protect our confidential data in a production environment by allowing only approved methods to access production data. But how are you protecting your development and testing environments when they contain copies of production databases?
In order to protect data and comply with regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA, databases used by development and testing must not contain private and sensitive data from production databases. In this presentation, Greg will demonstrate using a new feature of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) called Static Data Masking to protect your sensitive/confidential data when copying production databases to your development and testing environments.

## Speaker: Konstantin Kosinsky
## Title: Using Columnstore indexes in Azure DevOps Services. Lessons learned
## Abstract:
### The Analytics service in Azure DevOps Services provides all-over insights to your DevOps data: work item tracking, CI/CD pipelines, testing process etc. 
	 
Built on top of columnstore indexes, the Analytics service has to deal with 100s of millions records and daily growth in 10s of millions, only a few minutes delay from operation store, sub second query performance for in-product experiences as well as 3rd party extensions, Power BI integration and ad-hoc queries.
	 
Working on it, I've learned a lot of DOs and DON'Ts about columnstore indexes. Session covers how to:
* partition columnstore indexes in a multitenant environment
* maintain columnstore indexes in case of updates and/or purge to keep segment elimination possible
* evolve database schema without downtimes and maintenance windows
* design to benefit from predicate and aggregation pushdown
* deal with edge case like ad-hoc queries for raw data and paging
* choose between CCI and NCCI based on usage patterns

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Ron Talmage
## Title: Managing Table Partitions at the Extremes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s table partitioning gets interesting at the extremes: namely the initial (often “before”) partition, as well as the last (often “future”) partition. In this session you’ll learn how to manage partitioned tables at these extremes based on choices concerning the partition key, files and filegroups, archiving, and adding future partitions.

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Managing ETL Change using BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### You develop an SSIS package to load a flat file.  You meticulously identify each of the columns and map the columns to the target table.  Your package runs fine for months.  Then the file format changes.  It is back to the drawing board, selecting each column, setting the data types (type, length, etc.).  In many cases, you actually have the file structure in an electronic form.  Wouldn't it be nice to simply regenerate your SSIS package using that metadata? 

In this session I will demonstrate how to automate the generation of SSIS packages using the open source BIML and BIMLScript. 

I will then demonstrate how to use this technique to handle changes in file structure.  I will generate an SSIS package  from a simple Excel workbook I will represent the structure of a flat file and its relationship to a staging table.

Finally, I will use BIMLScript to handle changes from one version of SSIS to the next and from SSIS to Azure data factory.

## Speaker: Michael Wall
## Title: Becoming a Master by Giving It All Away
## Abstract:
### It has been said that “novices absorb knowledge like a sponge, intermediates hoard it for themselves, and masters just simply give it away.” 
The community spirit of PASS is for like-minded professionals to interact and share knowledge. But how do you do this in your own workplace? IT people are notorious about being siloed and not sharing their knowledge. That may be, but you have to move past all of that in order to truly move forward in your career and your life. There are many barriers in place to giving away your knowledge, but we will help you be ready to do so. 
The only way to truly become a master at your craft is to share your precious knowledge with your peers and workmates. We will discuss past and new trends in learning and knowledge transfer, the reasons why you should pass on knowledge, and methods for making this happen in your workplace and in your life.
By passing on your knowledge, you are leaving behind a legacy that extends beyond your tenure at an organization

## Speaker: Arvind Shyamsundar
## Title: Large-scale graph querying and analytics with SQL Graph
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL DB introduced capabilities to store and query directed graphs in the database, with further improvements in SQL Server 2019 and recent Azure SQL DB releases. As with any new feature, scalability is a top question. In this session, we will demonstrate the features and scalability of SQL Graph by using a publicly available graph dataset: the Open Academic Graph - OAG - (https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/). The OAG graph includes over 166 million academic publications and over 1 billion citations. We show you how to efficiently import such large-scale graphs into SQL and then fully leverage the SQL Graph features to accomplish common graph query tasks (finding citations) and advanced analytics (PageRank, Shortest Paths etc.) on this large-scale graph. After this session, you will be amazed by the functionality, performance and scalability of SQL Graph!

## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
## Abstract:
### Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

## Speaker: Arnie Rowland
## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI -It's So Confusing. Which Should You Use?
## Abstract:
### I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brian Carrig
## Title: Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.
