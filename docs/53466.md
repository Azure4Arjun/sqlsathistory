## Title: SQL Server Tips and Tricks from a lazy DBA
## Abstract:
### Good managers believe lazy people don#39;t work hard.  Great managers realize that a lot of lazy people get their work done, just more efficiently.  The right lazy person will find YOU a quicker, easier way to accomplish the same amount.
In this session, I will show you several of the tips and tricks I have picked up and use to make my life easier.  From keyboard shortcuts to some lesser-known SSMS built-in tools, I hope to make your life easier, and make you a lazy DBA, too!
