## Title: Leveraging SQL Spatial Analytics for Making Business Decisions
## Abstract:
### Imagine the possibilities if you were able to gather real-time insight into the traffic flow, patterns and behaviors of people while within your premises. Wi-Fi Location Analytics solutions leverage WiFi infrastructure to make this possible by capturing high volume real-time spatial positioning data from mobile devices. The spatial data is extracted, transformed and analysed in SQL Server to provide location based mobility services (such as tracking, mapping and way-finding)This session discusses how these Big Data solutions work and demonstrates data consumption via SQL 2012 spatial (direction, distance, speed, proximity), SSRS 2012 custom maps, and Excel Power View.
