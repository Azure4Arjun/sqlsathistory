## Speaker: Ed Elliott
## Title: Automated Database Developmer Testing
## Abstract:
### Oscar Wilde once said "We are all in the gutter, but some of us have unit tests" and it is as true then as it is now - databases hold code and if you want to:

- Make changes faster
- Improve the quality of your code
- Provide guaranteed examples that are proven to work

Then you should look at database testing but what is database testing? What are unit tests? Integration tests? Acceptance tests? How do you get started and keep going with automated testing?

In this session we will answer these questions and give examples of how to test database code and some of the challenges you will face along the way.

Whether you are completly new to developer testing or have been been "a mocking and asserting" in c# or java for years this session will get you started writing tests for your database code.
