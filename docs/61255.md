## Speaker: Mike Diehl
## Title: Agile Analytics: Automated builds and deployments
## Abstract:
### Your team must be able to compile and deploy their code at any time so that it can be tested for quality, or rolled out for production use with confidence. Using the build system in Visual Studio Online (or Team Foundation Server), we will look at what is necessary to automatically compile and deploy BI code assets, including SQL databases, SSIS projects, SSAS databases, and SSRS projects.
