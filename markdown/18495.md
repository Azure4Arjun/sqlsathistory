## Title: UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs as Primary Keys in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs as Primary Keys in SQL Server - a good or bad best practice? They have a lot of pros for DEVs, but DBAs just cry when they see them enforced by default as unique Clustered Indexes. In this session we will cover the basics about UNIQUEIDENTIFIERs, why they bad and sometimes even good, and how you can find out if they affect the performance of your performance critical database. If they are affecting your database negatively, you will also learn some best practices how you can resolve those performance limitations without changing your underlying application.
