## Abstract:
### In a real data mining or machine learning project, you spend more than half of the time on data preparation and data understanding. The R language is extremely powerful in this area. The Python language is a match. Of course, you do work with data by using T-SQL. You will learn in this session how to get data understanding with really quickly prepared basic graphs and descriptive statistics analysis. You can do advanced data preparation with many data manipulation methods available out of the box and in additional packages from R and Python. After this session, you will understand what tasks data preparation involves, and what tools you have in SQL Server suite for these tasks.
