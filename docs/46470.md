## Title: Managing Hierarchial Data in a Relational Database
## Abstract:
### Managing hierarchical data (such as Budgets, Bills of Material, or Organization Charts) can be a real challenge in a relational  database. This session will feature a design pattern that makes it seem almost simple. We'll see a database schema that is flexible and efficient. We'll also take some time to discuss common design mistakes. Finally we review a recursive CTE that will allow you to traverse large hierarchies with surprising speed!
