## Title: Performance troubleshooting in the Analysis Services Tabular and PowerBI world
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what sits behind the powerful tabular engine (the same, used in PowerBI)? How it achieves that blazing performance over billion and even trillion records? What are the compression algorithms? Or have you ever wondered what happens in the background when you visualize your reports? Well, I have, and I've gathered number of topics I want to share with you - from the engine internals, through tracing expensive queries (including PowerBI Gateway) and querying metadata, to optimizing your model for the best performance, model size and scalability.
