# SQLSaturday #517 - Philadelphia 2016
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Common Coding Mistakes and How to Mitigate them
## Abstract:
### Let the Big Bad Wolf huff, puff and blow your bad queries away.

There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code that do not scale well inside of SQL Server.

In this session we will focus some of these patterns and show you how to make them scale in the database engine. We will touch on Scalar-Value functions, Union, CTE, RBAR and more.

After this session, you can go back to your office Monday morning and be the code tuning rock star!
