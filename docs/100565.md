## Title: Azure databricks: brick by brick for the data engineer
## Abstract:
### Still developing your ETL with SSIS but you're willing to take a look to the new Azure databricks platform? This session is the first step to start developing with Azure Databricks! We'll start by the use-cases or if you prefer "when is it smarter to switch your good old SSIS for the new tools". Then we'll take a look to a data preparation and a data move with Databricks and we can automate its execution. Finally, we'll go for a few tips with the tooling.
