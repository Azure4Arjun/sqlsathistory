## Title: Machine Learning with R Presented with R/Shiny
## Abstract:
### You've seen demos on Azure Machine Learning Studio but did you know the real magic is done by calls to R code. In fact, R has been used to do predictive analytics for years which is why Microsoft integrated it into SQL Server 2016. In this presentation, we'll see how easy it is to select, train, and use models in R. We'll also discuss assessing the model's fit and comparing different models. All this will be done using Shiny, R's version of ASP .Net, i.e. essentially R Server Pages but amazingly easy to use which serves to demonstrate R's extensibility.
