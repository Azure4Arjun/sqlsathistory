# Who Has What to Which? (The Permissions Superset)
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-446)
Event Date: 24-10-2015 - Session time: 09:15:00 - Track: Admin
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: Who Has What to Which? (The Permissions Superset)
## Abstract:
### Do you know who has access to your database and what permissions they have? If you answered yes, you're most likely wrong. Permissions in SQL Server don't work the way almost everyone think they do. We'll look at different scenarios you are likely to see day-to-day and explore what permissions the users are actually getting (likely not what you expect).

This exercise will demonstrate why it is important to be strict about granting permissions and cleaning up old security accounts. You will learn how to think of permissions as a superset.

Event Date: 24-10-2015 - Session time: 09:15:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: How I survived supporting a Java team
## Abstract:
### After spending the last decade or so completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I spent the last year supporting the SQL Server instance for a team of Java developers. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. I did find, however, that there were cultural differences which made my biggest challenges different from what I was used to dealing with in the .Net world. Come hear about my misadventures with JBoss, server side cursors, and NOCOUNT settings.

## Speaker: Wolfgang Strasser
## Title: A Programmatic Journey Through SSISDB
## Abstract:
### With the advent of SQL Server Integration Services Catalog (SSISDB) a new place of storing, executing and monitoring SSIS packages came into existence. In this session, Wolfgang will show you different aspects of programmability in the context of SSISDB. Beginning with a short overview of the underlying database objects, a deeper look at SSISDB's stored procedures will follow. A side-step from TSQL to C# and the available Integration Services SDK illustrates a different view accessing SSISDB. 
Concluding, the analysing and reporting aspect of SSISB programmability is shown with some exemplified SQL Server Reporting services reports.

## Abstract:
### Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking. We'll discuss methods that take the stress out of the process by ensuring that you practice your deployments using continuous integration before you ever get near production. Automating the deployment and testing processes through various pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.

## Title: Power BI is Awesome!
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has changed its Business Intelligence strategy in the last few years from an IT centric approach with SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services to an end-user ad-hoc approach with Power BI. Initially the Power BI tools were all separate add-ons to Excel 2010+ that you had to know where to get them and install/activate them individually. Now with new Power BI product announcements and Power BI Designer, the full vision of these once separate tools is becoming more clear and cohesive as an end-user ad-hoc analysis and reporting tool. In this demo heavy session you will see how Power BI is now a much more complete solution and how it can change how you deliver analysis and reporting to anyone in your company. Demos will include using Power BI Designer to pull in data from multiple sources and repeatable transformations to clean usable data and build interactive reports and dashboards.

## Title: Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics
## Abstract:
### Do you find you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!
Partitioning allows us to break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks.  Partitioning can enable us to perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. We can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. 
In this 75 minute session we’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll look at how partitioning effects things under the hood to solidify our understanding of how it works. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of partitioning and be armed with the knowledge needed to make decisions on how and when to implement partitioning.

## Title: What you're missing out on if you're not using Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### Even if you don’t have a full-fledged Master Data project, there are use cases where SQL Server Master Data Services brings helpful tools to the table. For example, if you have data in Excel that your business wants to manage for compliance and/or wants to integrate, or have a requirement to augment data in a data warehouse dimension (such as adding and maintaining an attribute or grouping that isn’t present in the upstream system), MDS has functionality that can help you solve the problem.

This presentation will outline some of the core MDS functionality and will provide detailed walk-throughs of functionality used to solve business problems using MDS.
