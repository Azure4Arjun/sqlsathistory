## Title: SSIS Sucks!
## Abstract:
### If you are involved in data warehouse development using the Microsoft technology stack, then you have been introduced SSIS.  The question you will have asked yourself many times as you develop is: "What the #%@ were they thinking?".  This session is dedicated to providing an overview to some of the items that just drive you nutz using this tool in an enterprise environment, and having a laugh while we learn.

From tiny windows designed for a 640x480 monitor, to clicky-clicky-clicky madness, to the tool being anti-agile.  Developing and maintaining code with SSIS is enough to turn your hair gray early.  But it sure looked "snazzy" when your boss got a demo of it, so now it is your problem.

So if you are a seasoned developer come on out and commiserate with the community, and if you haven't used to tool yet you can find out what your boss is asking you to get involved with.

Either way this will be a fun presentation that I am hoping you won't soon forget.
