## Speaker: Kaloyan Kosev
## Title: Life of a query
## Abstract:
### Database queries have their own life. Sometimes it is not so long but for sure it is a fascinating one.
Come join me in a session where we will be chasing a wild query thru the SQL Server engine. Or at least put a DB Administrator on the interrogation table.
