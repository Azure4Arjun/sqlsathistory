## Title: The Data Warehouse of the Future
## Abstract:
### So you think you have the ultimate Data Warehouse...well think again.   The landscape or should I say the data lake is changing constantly.   We are getting data from all over the place.   How do we make it available and relevant for the consumers of a data warehouse.   Is Kimbell obsolete now, what about unstructured data, how about the gazillioin rows of click data, etc.   So the data and BI architects are all on suicide watch.    Well its not really that bad.   Microsoft has woken up and seen all that is going and has brought functionality to SQL Server to solve some of these issues.   This presentation provides an overview of technologies such as Polybase, Temoporal Tables, Columnstore Index, In memory tables, JSON support, etc.   that can be utilized to build the data warehouse of the future.
