## Title: Creating a Solid Data Model for PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### A solid BI Analysis starts with the model it is based on.

Using PowerPivot takes a change in mindset from the traditional pivot table connected to an excel sheet or SSAS cube. You will walk away with a better understanding of how to build your models and how to approach your data analysis when using PowerPivot.
