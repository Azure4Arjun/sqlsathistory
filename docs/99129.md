## Title: Secrets of the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### You have heard of a query plan, right?  Perhaps even looked at one somewhere along the way.  Have you ever wondered what information might be buried in the plan cache, the courses of action having that additional information might lead you to?  Perhaps you have wondered what plans in the cache would benefit from those missing indexes or contemplated your cost threshold of parallelism, among other questions.  This session is designed to answer just that.  We will look at query plans without the pretty node icons and from there we will interrogate the plan cache thus putting its secrets to work for us.
