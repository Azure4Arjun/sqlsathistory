## Title: A beginner's guide to Power BI Custom Visuals
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to Power BI custom visuals.
Power BI custom visuals are a great addition to the existing visuals in Power BI. With simple tools and a good dose of creativity you'll soon be able to create and develop your own.
Join me to learn: how to build them, what are the tools used, where to find visuals, where to publish your own both inside and outside your organization, what kind of governance you should apply.
I am not from a graphic designer but very fascinated by the extensibility of the Power BI platform when it comes to custom visuals.
At the end of this session you will have a complete understanding of all the elements needed to create great, alternative or crazy custom visualizations in Power BI.
