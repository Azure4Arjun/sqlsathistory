## Title: 45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.
