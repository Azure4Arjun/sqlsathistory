## Title: Backyard Grilling with Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Like great grilling, great SSAS starts with fundamentals.  We'll cook Rachel Ray's ingredients on the SSAS grill, showing all the basics for creating SSAS dimensions, measure groups, and performing basic calculations.  Add a lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and you have a tasty cube!
