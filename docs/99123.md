## Title: Use forecasting in your application with ML. NET
## Abstract:
### ML.NET lets you re-use all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer so ML.NET gives you the ability to add machine learning to .NET applications, in either online or offline scenarios. With this capability, you can make automatic predictions using the data available to your application. This presentation explains the basics of machine learning in ML.NET.
