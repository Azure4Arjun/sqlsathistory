## Title: Data Quality Services: Let's clean our data
## Abstract:
### Data quality and data consistency today are big concerns for people working with databases. 
Data Quality Services (DQS) is a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012, that aims to give users and IT professionals a simple and flexible solution to these problems.
It allows to perform cleansing operation on bad data such as: correction, standardization, completion and de-duplication. 

In this session we'll introduce the main concepts of DQS, and its components. We'll see how to create and build a Knowledge Base, how to implement a Data Quality Project, how to define and manage a Domain.
Starting from real world example, we'll learn how to perform Data Cleansing and Matching and how to define business rules to verify and mantain data integrity.

For those who are working with SQL Server versions prior to 2012,  we'll show some tasks and techniques to implement data quality, exploiting other SQL Server's suite tools, although DQS is not yet available.
