## Title: Table Partitions for Archiving and Performance
## Abstract:
### What is Table Partitioning?  How can it be used to enhance performance?  How can it be used with a data archiving strategy to quickly and easily drop archived data from a table?  We will discuss the practical applications of table partitioning using scripts to generate new table partitions, move a partition to another table and discussion on how this can benefit you.
