## Title: Combining Azure Cognitive Services and ML.net for AI empowerment!
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at ML.net and the different cognitive services to empower your solutions with AI. One of the large set of new features that will be covered is the customization feature of the cognitive services to fit your challenge. With this demo full session we will use custom vision to build/train and deploy a model with the power of the cloud. ML.net will be used to incorporate the trained model into an application without the need to call the online services. 

This by using Microsoft Cognitive Services and ML.Net:
•	Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of cloud-hosted API’s that empowers every developer to easily add AI capabilities for vision, speech, language, knowledge and search into applications and devices. 
•	ML.NET, a cross-platform, open source machine learning framework. ML.NET will allow .NET developers to use and develop their own models and infuse custom ML into their applications
