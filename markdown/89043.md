## Title: Introduction to BI Architecture
## Abstract:
### There is a ton of buzz in the market about BI, but do we really know what is BI Architecture?  We will go over an ideal architecture design and explain the various elements and tools that make up this architecture.  We will use the Microsoft BI Stack as a perspective, but architecture can be replicated with various vendor tools.
