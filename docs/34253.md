## Title: Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube 
## Abstract:
### Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, we look at a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.
