## Title: TempDB Inside Out
## Abstract:
### Either you are experiencing TempDB contention or you are not sure and want to find out.  This pain is something every DBA has experienced or will experience, but it's not easy to figure out how to set it up correctly.  You will learn how to identify if TempDB is having contention, what causes it to happen, where it can come from, and how to fix it.  We will discuss the required trace flags and when to use them as I demo the behavior.  You will walk away with the scripts and knowledge of how to configure TempDB per best practice.
