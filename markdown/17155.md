## Title: Enterprise-grade MDM On SQL Server - the Keys to Success
## Abstract:
### This session discusses a proven organizational approach and important technical considerations that lead to the successful adoption of Master Data Management (MDM) on SQL Server.   

Organizational considerations include building buy-in, team capability  expertise, and selling MDM to the rest of the organization while building a subject-area center of excellence.   We also discuss approaches to improved time-to-value and to ensure that the technology and staff investment is matched to the expected outcome.

Great technology choices will help ensure that your best laid plans succeed and the second half of this session goes over some important technology considerations.   In this part of the session we discuss User Experience, Integration Patterns, Matching, Programmability, and Data Quality.
