## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Abstract: As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this 1 hour session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of T-SQL and the SQL Server Engine.
Sections:
•	You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.
•	Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as you can talk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 
•	After looking at the key operators you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, the operator properties and identify common performance issues and tuning opportunities.
•	Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for later analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.
