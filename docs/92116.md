## Abstract:
### First impressions have long-lasting effects. When dealing with an architecture change like migrating to Azure SQL Database the last thing you want to do is leave a bad first impression by having an unsuccessful migration. In this session, you will learn the difference between Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instances, and Elastic Pools. How to use tools to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. You will learn how to successfully migrate your database schema and data to the cloud. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload(s) and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.
