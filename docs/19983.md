## Title: Index-fu - getting the most out of your indexes
## Abstract:
### So you know the difference between a clustered and a nonclustered index.  I won't review it again - I promise.  This session will focus on expanding your understanding of indexes and what you can use them for. We will look at the internals of how they are structured, included columns, filtered indexes and indexed views. We will explore how to use indexes to enforce contraints beyond just simple uniqueness.  Earn your SQL Black belt with this fun and informative session.
