## Title: Getting Started: Introduction to Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### First impressions have long-lasting effects. When dealing with an architecture change like migrating to Azure SQL Database the last thing you want to do is have a bad first impression. In this session, you will learn the difference between Azure SQL Database, Elastic Pools, Managed Instances, and Hyperscale.  You will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start your migration process. You will learn how to secure your data and also make your data highly available. Finally, you will learn how to determine which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload(s) and how to monitor your workload over time to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.
