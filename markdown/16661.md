## Title: Report Parts: Increasing Productivity Since 2008R2
## Abstract:
### Using SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services and Report Builder 3.0, report writers can store, re-use, and modify pieces of reports using "report parts". Report parts are stored on the report server and are provided to others for collaboration in a report part library to increase initial development productivity and decrease maintenance turn-around time. This presentation will describe how to set up a user-friendly and easily maintained report part library by discussing how to create report parts, how to store them on the report server, and how to import them into a new report.
