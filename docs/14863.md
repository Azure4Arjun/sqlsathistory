## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### SQL Server database administrators need to proactively prevent or minimize performance problems when they occur, and diagnose the cause to take the appropriate corrective action. The reasons for performance problems can range from a poorly designed database to a system that is improperly configured for the workload. This talk will focus on understanding common performance problems, diagnosing and troubleshooting using publicly available tools, and provide a general methodology for diagnosing and troubleshooting SQL Server performance problems using common customer scenarios.
