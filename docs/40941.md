Four years in the market, continuously changing, but still not understood. In AD2015 is it the right time to change this. With a full day Pre-Conf we start with our on-premises instances, next we touch the Sky, and as masters we will parachute back to the Earth.

In my Pre-Conf I want to show you how we can work with Windows Azure SQL Database (formerly known as SQL Azure) focused on;

- pros and cons
- differences
- place to start
- security
- tools, methods and ideas
- SWOT analyse
- backup and restore 
- RPO, RTO, ROI, SLA, SLO and more 
- Service Level Agreements, 
- compliance and responsibility
- best and worst practices
