## Title: Using Power BI to Deliver Self-Service BI
## Abstract:
### Over the past few years Microsoft has been investing heavily in self-service BI, and today it is possible to deliver Business Intelligence using nothing but Excel 2013.
Join us as we demonstrate how using the latest Microsoft BI toolset you can easily discover, analyze, and visualize any data. 
We will begin the session by using Power Query and the M language to import and shape our dataset. Then we will use Power Pivot and some basic DAX to build out a powerful in-memory data model. Lastly we will demonstrate how to present our data using Power View, and share our newly gained insights using Power BI for Office 365 and Power BI QA.
