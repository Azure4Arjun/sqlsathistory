## Title: Time to Solve your VLDB problems - Managed Instance Hyperscale Edition
## Abstract:
### Azure Managed Instances are one of the newest SQL Server related PAAS offering from Microsoft (Azure SQL Managed Instance went GA in September 2018). It can be considered a hybrid of Azure SQL Database and an on-premises SQL Server with all the great benefits of Platform as a Service.

Included in the Managed Instance Service Tiers is the new Hyperscale Storage layer.
Built from the ground up to take advantage of Cloud scalability this option offers an entirely new architecture  than can resolve the issue with  Very Large Databases (VLDB)

In this session we will explore 

What exactly are Azure Managed Instances
What the new Hyperscale storage layer is.
How it resolves VLDB issues and allows SQL Server to scale to 100TB+ 

Attendees will come away with an understanding of what  Azure Managed Instance HyperScale offers and where it makes sense to consider it.
