## Title: Cloud 9 on AWS
## Abstract:
### ***Beginners through Advanced***
Would you like to:
1. Launch any top-ISV software pre-configured to work with AWS Services when you need to, paying only for what you use by the hour, launched at the click of a button?
2. Compare multiple top-ISV software solutions that are marketed to "solve the same problems" to see which is the best fit for free?
3. Implement state-of-the-art software or unique software needed for particular clients without licenses, implementations or management?
4. Have a "playground" of a plethora of intelligent software solutions to innovate  improve your business?
5. Decrease the time it takes to plan, forecast,  make decisions?
6. Increase developer productivity/operational efficiency?
Come hear the biggest secret in maximizing the full offerings of AWS! Gartner claims because of AWS' multi-year advantage over competitors, it has the largest ecosystem of top-line ISVs (1,000+ vendors, well-over 3,000 solutions) to augment AWS Services.
