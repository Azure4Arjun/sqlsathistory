## Title: Accelerating SQL 2012 Clustering with NAND Flash
## Abstract:
### A DBA running SQL Server 2008 or above will often think he has no alternative to shared storage in order to run High availability Clustering in terms of both performance as well High Availability. Understand if it is worth trading high latency Shared Storage with low Price/GB to Local, Low latency OS integrated NAND Flash with high price/GB by trading Host Memory and CPU cycles for I/O Using NAND Flash from Fusion-io  Also, is there a potential License saving by running lower latency I/O and reducing CPU count?
