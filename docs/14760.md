## Title: Deadlocks and what to do about them
## Abstract:
### Confusion persists around what a deadlock is, why they occur, and how to prevent them. This session will give you a good overview of how deadlocks occur and what you can do about them. Most importantly, we'll go over the ways you can identify when a deadlock occurred and which processes were involved. We'll do all this using the standard SQL Server tools so you can put it to work on your systems immediately.
