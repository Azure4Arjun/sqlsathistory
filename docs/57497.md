## Title: Ensuring Plan Stability with Query Store
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduced Query Store, a new feature which tracks query metrics and can be used for troubleshooting, testing, and proactively monitoring a workload.  Query Store also provides the ability to force a plan for particular query, which means you may no longer need to use those tricky plan guides.

In this session, we'll start with a quick review of how Query Store works.  Then we'll examine plan forcing in depth, including why a forced plan will fail and how plan forcing compares to using plan guides.  Expect a lot of demos as we investigate how Query Store can help you do more than just troubleshoot issues, but also manage query performance.
