## Title: Meet JSON in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### There have been many data lingua franca over the years (EDI, CSV, XML).  Let's meet a new comer JSON (aka Jason).  JSON is the web developers new best friend, providing a schema free way to transmit and persist data.  SQL Server 2016 has provided new functionality to work with JSON.  In this session we will look at how to read a JSON document using the OPENJSON function.  We will also look at other methods for extracting information from JSON.  Finally, we will look at how to generate JSON documents from TSQL queries.
