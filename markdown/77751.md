## Title: Linux Power Pre-Con For The DBA (Paid Pre-Con)
## Abstract:
### In this pre-con, attendees will arrive with their laptops with Docker and the Linux image of SQL Server 2017 ready to go. The image and instructions can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker.

We'll use Docker and the newest SQL Server 2017 image to go from the A to Z of Linux, learning how to navigate, manage and manipulate Linux. We'll learn best practices surrounding file systems, security and database management.

Once we've become comfortable with the basics, we'll move onto more advance features and tools that have become the savior of DBAs working on Linux/Unix system for decades.
