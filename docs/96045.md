## Title: SSIS Performance Tuning with BimlScript
## Abstract:
### You may heard that Biml can automate ETL loads, but what if your data warehouse is several terabytes with a tight load window. In this demo focused presentation, we’ll discuss how to use BimlScript to accomplish the following:
– Dynamically create multiple SISS packages for a data warehouse ETL load, each following a different best practice design pattern.
– Automatically execute each package multiple times and record the results for analysis.
– Determine which package version should be used in production.
The only way to be sure that your SSIS packages are performing optimally is to test them against multiple patterns. Make your life easier and let BimlScript do the work for you.
