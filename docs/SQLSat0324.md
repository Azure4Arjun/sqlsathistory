# AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#324---Baton-Rouge-2014)

## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance.

## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Learn PowerShell or Die! That is, learn PowerShell or your career in IT will die. PowerShell is one of those technologies that as a DBA you’ll either love or hate, but believe it or not DBA’s already have the mindset for scripting since you live and work with T-SQL day in and day out. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate the different methods of retrieving information from your SQL Servers to include a way to simply wrap your existing T-SQL code inside of a PowerShell one-liner, working with SQL Server in PowerShell as if it were a file system, and creating reusable tools via functions in PowerShell that use SMO to retrieve just about any information about your SQL Servers that you could imagine.

## Title: What’s New in PowerShell Version 5?
## Abstract:
### With PowerShell version 4 being announced at TechEd last year and two preview versions of PowerShell version 5 already being released this year, it shows how committed Microsoft is to PowerShell and that it’s not going away any time soon which is why you can’t afford to ignore PowerShell or put off learning it any longer. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will cover the new features that are in the preview version of PowerShell version 5 to include the cmdlets in the OneGet module, the NetworkSwitch module, the PowerShellGet module and much more that you’ll have to come to this session to find out about! This session is based off of a preview version of PowerShell version 5 so everything shown is subject to change.

### Azure offers amazing capacities for computation for a low cost, but it can be a challenge to create a seamless user experience when there are so many moving parts. This talk will go over a methodology of getting potentially gigabytes of data to azure and back to the user seamlessly using ASP.NET MVC, SignalR, and Azure CORS. I also plan to go over some important limitations of various azure services and tools that I've discovered (the hard way) working on my projects with Azure.

# What I learned about functional programming in C# while using JavaScript
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#324---Baton-Rouge-2014)
Event Date: 02-08-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Web / Mobile Dev
## Speaker: Raghu Dodda
## Title: What I learned about functional programming in C# while using JavaScript
## Abstract:
### Programming in C# is about decomposing code into classes, but is it possible to achieve encapsulation and modularity using only lambdas? Apart from being an interesting excursion into functional features of the C#, this talk will illustrate how modularity can be achieved in languages such as JavaScript that emphasize functions over classes.

A basic understanding of Func and dynamic is necessary. Most of the talk will be coding in C#, with a few snippets of JavaScript.

# Managing Access Control with PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#324---Baton-Rouge-2014)
Event Date: 02-08-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: PowerShell
## Speaker: Rohn Edwards
## Title: Managing Access Control with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Access control in Windows, while very powerful, can be very complicated. Working with securitydescriptors one object at a time through the GUI is fairly straightforward, but that doesn’t help when you need to verify and/or configure settings for multiple objects at the same time. There are utilities available to handle this in an automated fashion, but most only work with certain types of objects, and they each have their own syntax. Fortunately, PowerShell has the ability to replace most, if not all, of those utility applications. In this session, we'll cover ways to use PowerShell to view and edit access control lists for almost any object in Windows that is secured with a security descriptor, including files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, WMI namespaces, Active Directory objects, and more. We'll cover using both native PowerShell commands, .NET methods, and the free “PowerShellAccessControl” script module.

We’ll cover what mirroring is from start to finish, how it can fit into an HA/DR plan, the rules surrounding its use, configuration via the GUI and T-SQL, as well as how to monitor mirroring. This presentation is designed to walk you through a basic implementation. At the end you will have learned what mirroring is, how it can fit into your environment, what business requirements it solves, and how to configure it.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### As DBAs there are many tasks we’re asked to do every day that we just accept as taking a long time because of some manual component we can’t get around.  Many of these tasks can be brought into line with regex.  You can use it to format your own T-SQL and create code that writes code with relative ease.  I’m going to teach you the basics of regex and show you how to perform many tasks that’ll make your life much easier like deploying code, formatting T-SQL, and much more.

## Title: Wait Stats: What are they and why you should care.
## Abstract:
### Many Application Support personnel, IT support, and even some DBA's are occasionally bombarded with "My application is slow", "the database keeps timing out", and many other end user complaints when supporting applications in any industry.  Instead of simply blaming it on the developers or simply brushing it off as a "vendor problem", wouldn't it be nice to understand the issues and notify the correct party?  This presentation is intended as a primer for wait stats.  Introducing the concepts, discussing why it's useful, then discussing a few ways that you can take this knowledge and apply it using a number of different approaches.  At the end I've also provided some examples of various LIVE environments I help manage so we can discuss what issues may or may not be prevalent.
