Event Date: 23-06-2018 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Robert Verell
## Title: Migration Basics
## Abstract:
### So you've got SQL Server instances that need to be moved off of old hardware or need a version upgrade for functionality and support purposes.  Where do we begin?  What pieces do we need to consider and how are we going to get them moved?  What kind of window do we need to move everything?

We'll cover all of these things and more, as well as querying the attendees on what to do next during certain steps to ensure you have your mind in the right place.  Migrations can be tedious, but if planned properly, they can be easy and expand your knowledge for SQL Server.

**This session does not cover dbaas migrations**
