## Title: Securing SQL Server Processes with Certificates
## Abstract:
### What do you do if the DBA won’t let you enable the Trustworthy setting?
 
Things like Trustworthy and cross-database ownership chaining open up huge security threats. Fortunately, there’s a better way.
 
You can secure things like cross-database operations, service broker communication, and high-privileged stored procedure execution with certificates via a process call signing. Additionally things like CLR assemblies that need external access can be executed safely using signed assemblies instead of enabling Trustworthy.
 
This session will cover common processes that can be secured through certificate signing, show how to sign the processes, and cover some basics of certificate management.
 
Note: this session does not cover securing SQL Server connections with SSL or self-signed certificates.
