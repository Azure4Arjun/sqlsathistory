# An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#554---Johannesburg-2016)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.

Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Peter Willmot
## Title: Using the SQL 2016 Query Store to optimise Performance and Scalability
## Abstract:
### SQL 2016 introduces the Query Store, a mechanism that has been built into the SQL 2016 database engine in order to facilitate rapid identification and resolution of performance and scalability bottlenecks in SQL application scenarios. In the session we will examine Query Store architecture and features and gain an understanding of how the tools should be used.

## Speaker: James McGillivray
## Title: Why you should be BI curious
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence. It's a rather all-encompassing term, isn't it.

In this beginner level session, learn the basics of Business Intelligence, the stages of BI maturity and get introduced to the Microsoft BI Stack, starting from the humble roots of Reporting Services, through to the incredible power of Interactive Dashboards in Power BI.

Whether you're looking for a different career option, or you're just interested in broadening your knowledge base, come and experience the wonders of being (in) BI! 

Note: This session comes packaged with a series of double entendres and other innuendos.

# Introduction to Database Design
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#554---Johannesburg-2016)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sean Cremer
## Title: Introduction to Database Design
## Abstract:
### Far too few database developers in this day and age get the opportunity to learn how to design relation databases.  In most cases, they will on occasion be asked to add a few objects to an existing system while following the standards of the organisation. These relatively infrequent changes do not hone the skills needed for effective design.

This session will go through the fundamentals of database design.  Topics such as normalization, Understanding Data Relationships as well as the Language of  Data Modeling and Design will be discussed. The Database Design Sequence Phases of Conceptual, Logical and Physical will be introduced as well.

## Speaker: Gordon Beeming
## Title: Your code is not just...your code
## Abstract:
### When you code do you only thing about your code? What about how you release it fast, with high Quality and in a regulated environment?

We'll take a look at how SQL code traditionally (or at least most commonly) gets into production. We'll then switch our focus to using unit tests as a way to help improve quality in the fast paced world we live in and a release pipeline to simplify it all

## Speaker: Michael Raam
## Title: From Me BI to We BI, take your BI solution beyond the clouds
## Abstract:
### ne of the main challenges organizations face in the BI world is to allow, via a single platform, contradicting needs of self-service BI with governance and Enterprise scale.
Come and see the game changing approach of Pyramid Analytics that allows organizations to obtain these impossible needs of business users and IT in a singular BI platform.
Pyramid Analytics the platform that Microsoft selected as a strategic partner for PowerBI.
 
Pyramid Analytics revolutionary platform provides a single platform that delivers:
•             Self Service – No code necessary.
•             Web based central administration and security.
•             Role based functionality for different roles in the organization (Professional, Analyst and Consumer).
•             Universal configuration – build once use anywhere (PC, Tablet and Mobile).
•             Enterprise scale – parallel processing, clustering and load balancing.
•             And more ….

Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Clinton van Blommestein
## Title: So, when you say database what do you mean?
## Abstract:
### These days when you say "database server" it could really mean many things.

For something like SQL server there are so many options: on-premise server, off-premise server. On-premise server with off-premise data. Then there are the various  Azure offerings with fancy names like Azure SQL, Data Lake, Hadoop.

You also get graph databases and document databases.

This session will cover some of the more popular types of data stores that are available today and we will look at their use cases. While SQL server is great for many things, one has to be aware of the other options that are available out there.

# Daily problems with indexing and its - possible - solution

## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Daily problems with indexing and its - possible - solution
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?

# The language informally known as M
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#554---Johannesburg-2016)
Event Date: 03-09-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Matt Horn
## Title: The language informally known as M
## Abstract:
### At the heart of Power BI is the Power Query Formula Language (informally known as M), a dynamically typed, case-sensitive functional language for creating mashup queries, similar to the F# language.

Although Power BI Desktop has a number of great UI features for transformations, under the hood it's all M, and the better you understand the language, the more you can take advantage of the capabilities inherent in Power BI.

In this session I will introduce you to the basics of the M language and demonstrate some of the more advanced features.

## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
## Abstract:
### If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, do, it's not use enough transactions.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we'll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We'll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We'll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we'll see why nested transactions are a lie.
