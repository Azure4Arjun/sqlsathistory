## Title: Type more, click less: using EzAPI to build SSIS
## Abstract:
### The EzAPI is a free .NET library produced by the SSIS team supporting 2008 and 2012. In this code-centric talk, we will start with a basic package and progressively work through the object model to build more complex packages. You will leave this talk with an understanding of how to spin up new packages that have variables, precedence constraints, dataflows, logging and configuration---all without abusing your poor mouse.
