### A hands-on session using Microsoft Power BI to show you how to build a Power BI dashboard from Excel spreadsheets, or a local/public database. It is led by Microsoft Gold Partner, CSG Pro.

This is intended as a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) session, however feel free to attend as an observer if you don’t have your laptop with you.

What is Power BI?
Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what’s important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
