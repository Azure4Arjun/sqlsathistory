## Speaker: Ross McNeely
## Title: 0 to Snowflake in 60 Minutes on Azure
## Abstract:
### Join this demo heavy session to get up and running on Snowflake in 60 minutes on Azure.  You will learn how to quickly setup a data warehouse that can scale-up to support any data size, or scale-out to support any number of uses. Just as important is scaling-down to save on cost.  We will first cover an overview of the Snowflake platform, and key enterprise capabilities.  Demos will include loading data into Snowflake, exploring data, data time travel, and provisioning for various end users without eroding performance.  Best practices will be discussed throughout the session, and we will conclude with a use case.  Ross McNeely is a certified SnowPro.
