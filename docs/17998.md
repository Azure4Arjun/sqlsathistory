## Title: Windows Operating System Internals for DB Pros
## Abstract:
### In this session, we’ll take a look at Windows operating system internals, including kernel architecture, threads and processes, memory usage, and I/O, and how they affect how SQL Server performs and acts. By having a good understanding of how the operating system works under the covers and how it interacts with the SQL OS, you will gain a deeper knowledge of what’s going on with your SQL Servers and where performance issues may be on your systems.
