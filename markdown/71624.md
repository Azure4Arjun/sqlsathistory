## Title: Rethink Server Sizing
## Abstract:
### Does it seem strange server sizing articles automatically assume that a 2-socket system, with some number of cores, is the right solution, excepting a 4-socket for extreme circumstances? Or is this accepted because thatâ€™s what everyone assumes absent rational technical explanation based on recent generation components? There were once valid reasons for multi-socket as the baseline system, but the world has changed since then. Were your database and application architected together to achieve high memory locality on a NUMA system? If this question cannot definitely be answered in the affirmative, then more than likely a single socket system is the best server platform for database transaction processing. This is not an option currently offered by the major cloud providers.
