## Title: Why PowerBI? Introducing Microsoftâ€™s new BI tool
## Abstract:
### The Power BI Suite has been around for less than a year and is changing every week. However, the technology behind it has been around for years now. It can be confusing trying to understand PowerThis and PowerThat. In this session, we will cover the different parts of PowerBI and what makes it new and exciting. We will look at how PowerBI fits into the existing Microsoft BI ecosystem. Finally, we will go over the process of creating and publishing a dashboard.
