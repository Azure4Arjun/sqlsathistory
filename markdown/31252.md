## Speaker: Keith Rowe
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Before you get immersed in all the technical details of SQL Server, let's talk about the fundamentals.  What does it mean to normalize a database?  How do I pick a natural primary key vs. a sequence?  What about naming tables, views, columns, etc?  We will use the "chalk talk" format.  I will introduce a topic then ask the class to share their ideas and experiences with the topic.  We will have plenty of fundamentals to cover, so I will serve as moderator to keep us on track. Quoting cycling great Greg LeMond - "Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time."
