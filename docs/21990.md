## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Data Mining
## Abstract:
### Data mining as a technology is used to analyze data by revealing patterns. These patterns can then be used to derive knowledge about data, and in turn this knowledge can be used to enhance application designs and the user experience. In this session, you will be introduced to the data mining capabilities in SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services, and demonstrations on how to specifically design, develop, explore, evaluate and query data mining models. This session is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the ease in which it can be accomplished.
