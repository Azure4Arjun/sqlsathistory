## Title: Building and Executing a Disaster Recovery Plan
## Abstract:
### Nobody wants to have a catastrophic event, but bad things happend to good datacenters.  Whether it's 42 inches of snow, 18 inches of rain, extended power outage, whatever, your business needs to be able to operate.  We'll start at a general level in terms of how to build your DR plan and then drill specifically into what you need to do to restore database services to an operational state.  We'll draw on information from the High Availability session and add additional color commentary on what the most important things are to consider when building, and most importantly testing your DR plan.
