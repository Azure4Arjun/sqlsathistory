## Title: Python: Turn your SQL ETL up to 11
## Abstract:
### Almost everywhere you look in the data community you see Python being used (job-postings, Azure Services, AWS Service etc…). But what is Python, and why has it become such a popular tool for Data Professionals? During this discussion we will talk about what is Python, why is it being used so heavily, what benefits it provides, and what is in store for future uses of Python. There will be demos using Jupyter Notebooks doing data analysis, importing data into database (ETL), and light visualization.
