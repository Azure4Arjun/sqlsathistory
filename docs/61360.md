## Title: Azure real-time analytics and kappa architecture with Kafka and Cassandra clusters.
## Abstract:
### Apache Kafka is the most popular open source stream-ingestion broker and can handle large numbers of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Kappa architecture based on Kafka and Cassandra clusters provides a powerful event processing solution for massive amounts of data produced by  real-time applications.
During the session we will dive into different aspects of building real-time streaming analytics, will review approaches of a kappa architecture implementation on Azure and will discuss experience of massive event processing and monitoring projects. All examples are taken from a real project for on-line monitoring of drones.
