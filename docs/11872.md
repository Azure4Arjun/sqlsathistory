## Title: SQL 2012 OLAP vs Tabular Modeling
## Abstract:
### The Highway Safety Research Group at Louisiana State University, funded by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LA DOTD), collects and analyzes traffic crash data for the state of Louisiana.  Over the past few years, a major focus was placed on decreasing the time it takes to report crash data to the state.  With the success of data collection efforts, the HSRG is now focusing on providing tools and resources to help agencies at all levels throughout the state better understand and utilize their crash data.  

In 2011, the HSRG developed an OLAP cube for 'slicing and dicing' crash, DWI, and Roadway data to improve traffic safety. In 2013, the HSRG, utilizing the same data warehouse, built a very similar tool utilizing the new BISM Tabular Model in SQL 2012.  This session will show the two models, discuss advantages  disadvantages of each model, and present data reporting options (Reporting Services, Tableau, and Power View).
