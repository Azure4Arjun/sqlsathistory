## Title: Getting More from Analysis Services – Writing Data Back
## Abstract:
### Excel power users have become accustomed to pivot tables displaying data from an Analysis Services Cube.  What happens when they want to “tweek” things in what-if-analysis or make future projections?  SSAS writeback measure groups allow for these scenarios.

In this demo-centric session we’ll see what it takes to setup and use a writeback enabled measure group.  We will work through a specific but simple business use-case to help reinforce the overall process.
