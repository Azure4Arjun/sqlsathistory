## Title: Azure Data Studio – Way Cool for Azure and On-Prem SQL
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Studio (ADS) cross-platform database development tool which runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. ‘ADS’ supports SQL Server and Postgres (with more DB platforms soon) and works both on-prem and in the cloud. ADS is highly extensible, open source, and can dramatically change the way you approach SQL coding.

And demonstrate why Azure Data Studio is in fact Way Cool.
