## Speaker: Frank Gill
## Title: Interrogating the Transaction Log 
## Abstract:
### Without the transaction log, SQL Server would have no way of maintaining a consistent and durable view of its data.  It would be pandaemonium!!!  Think of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  

Thankfully the transaction log is there and we can all breathe easier.
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses the transaction log to maintain the durability and consistency of its data, along with methods for reading the transaction log and identifying active transactions.
