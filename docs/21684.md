## Title: Why do we shun using tools for DBA job?
## Abstract:
### Over the past many years, I have only come across very limited DBAs who actually openly admit use of third party tools that make their lives easier. Otherwise most DBAs find pleasure in writing complex queries to do routine stuff like backups, maintenance, monitoring; you name it. 

I would like to share my experience as a DBA, where I have used tools unashamedly to improve my productivity. 
Hopefuly after this session, you will find the same confidence in using third party tools. Then, use the time saved, to enhance your carreer.
