## Title: Full-Text Search with Custom Proximity
## Abstract:
### Custom proximity search is a new feature introduced in SQL Server 2012 Full-Text Search. It's facilitated using the NEAR operator, allowing it to be used in the CONTAINS predicate or CONTAINSTABLE function. The NEAR operator allows for searching words near each other. It also allows the user to specify the maximum number of non-search terms separating the first and last search terms in a match. In addition, an optional parameter can be used to specify an exact order match.
