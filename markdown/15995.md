## Title: Principles of BISM Tabular Modeling
## Abstract:
### Although the Tabular framework is based on simple one-to-many relationships, there are important rules to follow when modeling business scenarios:   DAX direction of context propagation, Lookup vs Base tables, disconnected tables and calculated aggregate tables are some of the things to consider when delivering real life Analysis Services models.  This session reviews some of the most important  'gotchas' encountered when doing developing SSAS models.
