## Title: Minimize fragmentation during data loading
## Abstract:
### BI data store mostly serves scan-centric operations. As such, it is important to minimize fragmentation during data loading process.

I will demonstrate ways to look at fragmentation and how to best avoid them while achieving fast data loading process. BCP, partitions, partition switch, and verifications will be discussed and demonstrated in having data tightly packed with 0 to minimal fragmentation.
