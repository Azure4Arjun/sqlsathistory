## Title: Azure Analysis Services: Purpose, Migration, Benefits, and Tools
## Abstract:
### This presentation will briefly go over the history of OLAP and Microsoft's contribution to the technology.  The bulk of the conversation will then be an introduction to Azure's analysis services implementation - how to use it, how much it may cost, a comparison to on-premises implementations, and how to migrate from on-premises.  Then more intermediate subjects will be discussed, such as analysis of best practices and automation techniques, future features Microsoft is working on, and future research considerations for a more advanced look at Azure Analysis Services.
