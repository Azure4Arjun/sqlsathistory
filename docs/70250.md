## Title: Polybase In Action
## Abstract:
### Polybase is Microsoft's newest way of integrating SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  In this talk, we will get an overview of the Polybase technology and then implement it to work with an on-premises Hadoop cluster as well as Azure Blob Storage.  We will then dive into the mechanics of how Polybase works, using packet captures to understand the cross-network communication.  Finally, we will look at ways of tuning common Polybase scenarios and look at a few less-common scenarios.
