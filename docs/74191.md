## Title: Numbers Don't Lie.  Or Do They?
## Abstract:
### 82.7% of all statistics are made up.
Don't believe it?  
Well, you shouldn't.
Statistics and data visualizations are misused every day.  Sometimes by mistake, but often enough - deliberately. 
You already know not to believe everything you read, so now come and develop a critical look at statistics and data visualizations.  
Learn the "tricks of the trade" and become a better consumer of graphs, charts, and infographics.
