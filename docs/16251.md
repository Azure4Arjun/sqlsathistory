## Title: AlwaysOn, Clustering, Mirroring:  What are they?  What aren't they"
## Abstract:
### We hear these names bandied about, but what exactly are they?  How do they benefit the end user?  How do they differ?  What problems do they solve?  How does a DBA implement them?
We will address these technologies showing what they do.  We'll describe the typical situations where they are used.  We'll list the major costs associated with each.  We'll give bullet points that can help management decide whether to implement a given option.
