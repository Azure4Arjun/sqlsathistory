## Title: Calculation Group in SSAS 2019
## Abstract:
### Calculation group is a new DAX feature introduced in SSAS 2019 where it creates generic DAX formulas in the model and  uses them for different measures in the reports. For example time series calculations such as MTD(month to date), YTD(year to date), same period in previous year are very popular and are usually required to be created for most of the measures. By creating these measures  for any numeric metrics( such as sales, orders, refund,…) we will end up with too many measures which take a lot of development time and make the model pilled up with many measures. Instead of creating measures for each metric, the formula can be created once in a Calculation Group and then be used in the reports for multiple measures.
