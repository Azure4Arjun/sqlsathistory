## Title: Hash Match, the Operator
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has a lot of difference execution plan operators. By far the most interesting, and the most versatile, has to be the Hash Match operator.
Hash Match is the only operator that can have either one or two inputs. It is the only operator that can either block, stream, or block partially. And it is one of just a few operators that contribute to the total memory grant of an execution plan.
If you ever looked at execution plans, you will have seen this operator. And you probably have a rough idea of what it does. But do you know EXACTLY what happens when this operator is used? In this 500-level session, we will dive deep into the bowels of the operator to learn how it performs.
It is going to be wild ride, so keep your hands, arms, and legs inside the conference room at all times; and please remain seated until the presenter has come to a full stop.
