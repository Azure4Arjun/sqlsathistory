## Title: The Top Ten Mistakes that New Leaders Make
## Abstract:
### We can easily recognize a great leader when we see one. The great ones make it look easy while the bad ones look inept. Some people believe that leadership is innate, that a chosen few are born to lead while the rest are destine to follow. But that’s not true. Leadership is a skill; it can be nurtured and developed like any other skill. And as with many things, we can learn from others’ mistakes.
