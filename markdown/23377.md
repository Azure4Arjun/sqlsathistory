## Title: Hour of Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is Microsoft's exciting new self-service business intelligence (BI) solution delivered through Excel and Office 365. Using Power BI, business users can discover, combine, model, analyse and visualize data through the creation of immersive BI solutions, share them with other users, and access them from anywhere, on any device.

In this session, Rod will focus on;
1.	What is Power BI?
2.	How does Power BI differ to traditional BI tools such as Analysis Services, Reporting Services  PerformancePoint Services?
3.	What do you need to run Power BI, and how do you get it?
4.	Where does Power BI fit in an organization's broader enterprise BI strategy?

In addition to answering the above questions, Rod will build a Power BI solution from scratch, in real time. Rod will use Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map inside Excel 2013, before deploying the solution to a Power BI site in the cloud, and interacting with it using Q  A, the new natural language query techno
