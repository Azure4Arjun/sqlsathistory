## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning. Practical Guide.
## Abstract:
### Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in process of performance tuning. And in this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way we will learn practical techniques of performance tuning and solve bunch of issues. All this will be done using tools, which are installed on your system by default. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.
