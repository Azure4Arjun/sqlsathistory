## Title: Database Development Using SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### As a developer, you are using Visual Studio to manage your C#, VB.Net, and other projects. Why not your database projects as well?

As a DBA, you are using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to develop your database projects. But as an experienced DBA, you can get frustrated quickly with its limitations. 

There's a better way! Database Development got completely revamped with the release of SQL Server Data Tools. A FREE download, SQL Server Data Tools, or SSDT for short, allows you to manage the development of databases with a powerful, yet easy to use project interface.

In this session we'll look at the tools included with SSDT such as the all new localdb, database snapshots, and the new way to publish your database. You'll also learn how to reverse engineer existing databases into your project, as well as how to do safe refactoring. See how to streamline your database development with SSDT!
