## Title: Industry 4.0 in a box [DE]
## Abstract:
### IoT is often associated with developer boards such as the Raspberry PI or Arduino. However, IoT has not only played an important role under the slogan "Industry 4.0", many industry companies are using IoT in their production lines since years.

To show the potential of the Azure IoT in connection with industry components, we have took a conveyor belt, a sorting unit and sensor technologies built-in in a small flightcase. All these industry components are communicating directly to an Azure IoT Hub. 

See how we can analyze the generated data with Stream Analytics and building Power BI dashbaords with streaming data. We will also show how we can interact with the components via cloud 2 device messages if the analysis shows errors or disfunctionalities and how Cortana Analytics can help minimize errors.
