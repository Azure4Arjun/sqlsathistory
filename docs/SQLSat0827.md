## Speaker: Drew Furgiuele
## Title: Building the HASSP: Putting SQL Server In Space
## Abstract:
### In today's world, technology is a pervasive part of our lives. We have "smart" appliances everywhere: from cars, thermostats, and even refrigerators contain built-in systems to collect, store, and transmit data. Small embedded devices can also be used for scientific purposes as well, offering new and exciting ways to collect data for studies or projects at home.

The High-Altitude SQL Server Project, or HASSP, is one such project.

The HASSP team has created a high-altitude balloon that uses sensors to collect various data points and store the results in an embedded version of SQL Server!

In this session, you'll hear about how this is possible: we'll discuss the hardware used, the custom device that we built, and the software used to make it all work together. Best of all, you'll see how to recreate (and hopefully improve!) the project on your own.

# “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-827)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 11:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
## Abstract:
### Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code. We'll also introduce a new way to graphically see actual index structure using a new "Black Arts" stored procedure called "sp_IndexDNA" that you have to see to believe.

## Speaker: Kevin Hill
## Title: Your SQL Servers are misconfigured
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Servers are misconfigured!

And it is probably not your fault. 

90% of the SQL Servers I have seen in my 18 year career are just wrong.   Not “crash” or “won’t start” wrong.  More like “why is the website so slow” wrong.

We are going to roll through a clean install and look at some things that can be made right during the install. And then we will look at some configurations that can only be done after the install.

Things like:

Instant File Initialization
Backup Compression
MAXDOP
TempDB configuration
Cost Threshold for Parallelism
And more if we have time!

Fair warning…I’m going to overuse the phrase “It Depends”

Dallas DBAs is dedicated to helping you find these issues, test them, remediate them and get the most stability, reliability and performance out of your SQL Server.

## Speaker: Mindy Curnutt
## Title: AzureVM + Log Shipping + Automation = Bargain Basement DR Solution (How To)
## Abstract:
### Operating on a budget can result in some creative solutions. Recently I've come up with a creative solution for traditional on-premise client-server solutions that allows for full redundancy in the cloud, but at a budget price. This is accomplished through VMs, copying of logs to Blob Storage, automation of hydration, updates  de-allocation.  It may be a bit of a Rube Goldberg machine, but it works! The result is an extremely pro-rated and affordable DR solution that is within 1 hour or less of production in restorability. Come to this session to learn more about the hurdles faced when putting this solution together and to brainstorm together how it can even be improved.

## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
## Abstract:
### Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file  log file backups a whole lot more happy and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.

## Title: PowerShell for the DBA
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.

# Getting Started with Apache Spark
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-827)
Event Date: 30-03-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Getting Started with Apache Spark
## Abstract:
### As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data.  Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes.  As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk.  Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data.  In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark.  We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues like calculating PageRank.

## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: Who's Pissing in Your Data Lake?
## Abstract:
### The new data terms of Data Lake, Data Reservoir, and Data Swamp have left me with more questions than answers. In this presentation, Karen discusses the types of data anomalies that organizations can run into when they use external data, the wrong datasets for the right reasons and the right datasets for the wrong reasons.  

These errors in design, oversights and old school, traditional practices can impact the success of your projects, even if you don't use any data lakes.

We'll look at end-to-end processes, data capture issues, impractical designs, balancing performance against data quality.  I'll be using examples from my own personal data to show you just how my data has been mistreated in IT systems.  Plus we'll talk about your data and your data stories.

We will build a list of good practices and tools to use to spare you from a flood of data issues in your organization.

## Speaker: Sam Nasr
## Title: Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.
