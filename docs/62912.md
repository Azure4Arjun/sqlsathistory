Event Date: 15-07-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence  Data Science
## Speaker: Mark Wilcock
## Title: A lazy data scientist's toolkit
## Abstract:
### The client has some burning business questions and you have the client's data. So which tools will help you to understand that data and tell your client something they did not know already?  In this session, I'll take you through my personal choice, demo each of them and explain their value.  These include Excel; Tableau; R and RStudio and my favourite packages; Power BI and especially the fabulous Query Editor; SQL; cubes and Azure Machine Learning.  

I will also demo the tools I expect to  be using soon as my projects propel me into the new world of Azure cloud and big data, of Spark and Hadoop.  I hope to show "plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose" and that old friends such as R and SQL are also useful in this new world.
