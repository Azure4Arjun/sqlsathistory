## Title: Introduction to Developing with SQL Azure 
## Abstract:
### The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena. We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs. This talk will be a step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio AddIn. You’ll find that Azure is so easy to work with, you’ll get two for the price of one in this talk: you’ll learn Azure and learn how to create a Management Studio AddIn!
