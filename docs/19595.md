## Title: Storing Character Data Optimally
## Abstract:
### So you need to store character data in your database? Easy enough, you just create an nvarchar(MAX) field and you're done, right? It turns out, it's not so simple. First up you need to decide on a data type - should you use text? Char(100)? Varchar(100)? Or perhaps one of the (MAX) types? I'll go through the options we have, including a deep dive on how each data type differs in its storage on disk. Knowing this, we can make intelligent decisions on which type to use, as well as predicting actual performance implications. Knowing how to store character data optimally is an absolutely critical part of your job as a DBA.
