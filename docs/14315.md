## Speaker: Frank Quintana
## Title: An introduction to Business Intelligence and Big Data
## Abstract:
### The problem with the old way of organizing and analyzing data in RDBMS is that it is painfully slow, incomplete and costly. We are obligated to be selective and work with data in small chunks. In the best case scenario we partitioned our data and archived it with the hope to eventually use it, but the fact is that when data is being archived, usually, it is never used again. We donâ€™t even bother with collecting all the data due to economics and technical limitations. 
In this presentation I will introduce BI and Big Data, explain advantages and disadvantages of OLTP, OLAP and Big Data.
