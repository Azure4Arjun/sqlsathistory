## Title: A Deep Dive into Locking, Blocking  Latches
## Abstract:
### This topic sounds scary, but itâ€™s not. Regardless of whether you have a small database with only a few users, or a large multi-tenant system, you have Locking, Blocking, Latches, and Spinlocks. Understanding what they are and how they work is the first step in understanding how to troubleshoot them. Deadlocks are a problem, but they are a problem we can fix. In this session, we will explain and investigate how to find and fix the problems that we see in our database every day.
