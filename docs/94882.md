## Title: T-SQL Window Function Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Join this session and learn everything you need to know about T-SQL windowing functions!

SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions and create simpler code by using the windowing functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

You will also learn what you need to know to take full advantage of these features to get great performance. We’ll also discuss which features perform worse or better than older techniques, what to watch out for in the execution plan, and more.
