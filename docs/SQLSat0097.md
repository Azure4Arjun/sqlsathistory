# Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#97---Austin-2011)
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: David Stein
## Title: Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make
## Abstract:
### Many data professionals understand the basics of Data Warehouse design, including Dimension and Fact Tables, slowly changing Dimensions, and the use of meaningless surrogate keys. However, it isn’t until you’ve created a dimensional model and put it into production, that you realize just how much of an impact seemingly trivial mistakes can make. They can hobble performance, allow inaccuracy, and perhaps worst of all, inhibit adoption and usage of the new system. 

Learn how to avoid many common mistakes, from someone who’s made them and then found ways to correct them.

## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Code Sins
## Abstract:
### It’s impossible to follow every best practice all the time. “Code sins” are those things we do to our code that are either so horrendous that they can’t be borne, or that have such tremendous consequences that your stored procedures wish they’d never been created. Attendees will hear about the most common code sins that make code difficult to read, support, run and extend, and practical strategies for reversing the trend.

## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: T-SQL Brush-up:The Best Things You Forgot You Knew
## Abstract:
###  You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool, and that FOR XML isn’t as scary as it looks. This session is chock full of code examples.

# Denali AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#97---Austin-2011)
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 1
## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: Denali AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. Denali AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.

# SQL Server Performance Analysis
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#97---Austin-2011)
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Bonus
## Speaker: Mike Hotek
## Title: SQL Server Performance Analysis
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning is something that every DBA and developer will have to do at some point.  You'll find all kinds of recipes, cookbook, and processes to do performance tuning.  The hardest part isn't tuning something, it is figuring out what to tune and what is worth tuning in the first place.  Many people don't have the time to do performance tuning, because so much time is spent figuring out what to tune that no time is left to actually tune the code.  This session will take you through all of the tools necessary to gather the data necessary to do the analysis as well as how to quickly cut through all of the background noise to zero in on the most important things that need to be tuned.

## Speaker: Sean McCown
## Title: The Backup Tune-up
## Abstract:
### Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups.

# Analysis Services Performance Monitoring Deepdive
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#97---Austin-2011)
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Sid Atkinson
## Title: Analysis Services Performance Monitoring Deepdive
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services performance troubleshooting can appear more art than science - there are no query plans to view for optimization, server configuration documentation can be sparse and getting consistent results with specific query tests does not always yield the results you desire.  How can you know you can meet the SLAs for the user experience?  What is the performance elbow on the number of concurrent users?  Did my new aggregation or partition actually make a difference?

This session will go into details on how to configure a performance monitoring environment, how to gather data and then interpret results into actionable steps, allowing attendees to answer these questions.  Assumes some experience with Analysis Services and MDX

## Speaker: Steven Ormrod
## Title: SQL Server Amnesia
## Abstract:
### Losing your memory is never fun.  Well, I can't help you with that, but I can help show you how SQL Server is using its memory and some things to look at with regards to performance problems.

When I started as a DBA I didn't know much about SQL Server internals.  I inheirited quite a few servers and they were experiencing performance problems.  Over time I learned more about the internals and how to troubleshoot systems.  I'll share some stories with you and talk about some of the methods I use to look at how SQL Server is using its memory.  Then we'll look at some examples and demo code.

## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

# Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#97---Austin-2011)
Event Date: 01-10-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 2
## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
## Abstract:
### We often run a fine line between how much space we need, and how much space we have for our databases. Having too much drive space can be a waste of resources; however, running out of space is an obvious issue. Let’s find a way to straddle the line and determine just how much space we really need, give ourselves a bit more than that, and make it a regular process to baseline, then continue to monitor, make adjustments along the way if needed, and ultimately plan for just enough space to get us through the year on budget. We’ll talk about a stand-alone tool that I used to determine space use for baseline, continued monitoring of the space used, and ensuring we have enough but not too much space.
