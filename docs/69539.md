## Speaker: Kevin Wilkie
## Title: What could be better than football and R!
## Abstract:
### R -- it's included in SQL Server 2016. What can I do with it? Why do I need to know yet another software language? How can I use it to figure out important things -- like who is the best qb in the league right now, statistically?

We'll go over the basics of R and how to do things with it, plus items such as:

- Installing and managing packages
- Accessing data in various formats
- Basic data visualization functions
