## Title: How to Bully Your Query Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### Sometimes bad execution plans happen to good queries. You may have heard that it's better to rewrite complex TSQL-- but is using a temporary table better than using query hints? In this session you'll learn the pros and cons of using hints, plan guides, and the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 to manipulate your execution plans. You'll take away a checklist of things to do every time you decide to bully an execution plan.
