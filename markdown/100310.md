## Title: The Power of Power BI Themes or I Haven't Written Themes Since High School
## Abstract:
### Power BI uses themes to customize the look of Power BI reports. I hope most of you already know how to change colors and fonts in your BI reports. But if you are doing that for every data visualization on every page/tab, you are: 1) wasting a lot of time configuring these same properties multiple times, and 2) risking inconsistent styles (colors and fonts) because it is so easy to miss one or more of the format settings as you go from one data visualization on one page to another. But what if you could define your format settings one time and use them across all your pages, even in multiple BI files created by yourself and others in your organization creating a consistency or branding that would be difficult to achieve manually. This session explores how you can build and use themes to accomplish such a task. It consists mostly of demonstrations with an introduction into basic JSON which sounds scarily like coding but don't worry, I'll guide you through the rough waters.
