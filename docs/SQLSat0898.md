# Who, What, When. Monitoring usage of your MS BI stack
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: Who, What, When. Monitoring usage of your MS BI stack
## Abstract:
### You have created great cubes, Power BI reports and Reporting Services reports but how do you know if it is being used? Learn how to set up the collection of the usage data and how you can use this data in your decision making. 

We will talk about how to collect the data, how to build something meaningful from the data and how you can report on top of the data. We will do this for SSAS cubes (tabular and multidimensional), for Power BI reports and for Reporting Services Reports and we will explore ways you can further develop this for your own organization. 

At the end of the session all participants will leave with all the code as well as the know how to get started with the collection of usage statistics for their Microsoft BI Solutions.

# Bringing AI to the edge - Azure Cognitive Services in docker containers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: Bringing AI to the edge - Azure Cognitive Services in docker containers
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) are a set of APIs, SDKs and services. They are available to developers to make their applications smarter, more engaging and easier to find. Cognitive services extend Microsoft's AI platform.

How can you use these API's if you don't want to send your data to an Azure Data Center? Not every data set should leave your company. That's why Microsoft now offers the whole thing as a docker image, which you can run on your own hardware. As a company, you regain control over your data.

# Managing Memory for Optimal Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: Managing Memory for Optimal Performance
## Abstract:
### Memory is one part of the holy trinity of resources consumed by SQL Server, the others being CPU and disk. Most people know how to look at disk latency and throughput and then take remedial measures to fix those issues. But what about memory issues?
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses memory and various caches, how to gauge memory pressure, and how to address the significant problems it can cause.
You will leave with a much clearer understanding of how to monitor and manage memory consumption within SQL Server using native Dynamic Management Objects.

# Microsoft Power BI Deployment Types
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Philipp Lenz
## Title: Microsoft Power BI Deployment Types
## Abstract:
### This session gives you an overview how Microsoft Power BI can be deployed. The Focus is on the Cloud, Hybrid and on Premises.  After the session you will have an idea which type should be the best for each scenario, because every project has different requirements. So there is no right or bad way – it depends on the project and also on the budget and some other regularities.

# First steps with SQL Server on Docker
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Bartosz Ratajczyk
## Title: First steps with SQL Server on Docker
## Abstract:
### Containers are gathering more and more attention. Wherever you take a look at - you have them. SQL Server 2019 introduces Big Data Clusters that utilise Kubernetes to orchestrate SQL Server, Spark and HDFS containers. Starting with SQL Server Express 2014 each next version of SQL Server is available as a Docker container. If your contact with containers technology was somehow limited - it's time to change that.
 
Join me in the session where I will introduce you to the Docker containers world. You will see their phenomena and will take a look at how you can start using them in your work. During the hour we will start from the beginnings, through use cases, to configuring custom SQL Server environment within minutes and starting it in seconds. We will focus on SQL Server, but also take a look at the other applications.

# Getting your ducks in a row - Understanding ordered data flows
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: Getting your ducks in a row - Understanding ordered data flows
## Abstract:
### There's a lot of information out there to overwhelm you when it comes to performance tuning your queries. It's very easy to feel like you're drinking from a fire hose when you're reading long blog posts or listening to technical conference sessions. Operators, metrics, wait statistics, page life expectancy, parallellism and fragmentation.

But let's take a step back and understand the one fundamental principle of querying data - ordering. This session is all about interactively and visually explaining the flow of data in terms of ordering, and how that affects the performance of your queries and server.

Once you get these basics right, tuning will feel so much easier and execution plans may even start to appear quite intuitive.

# It depends - don't mistake your Google search for my database knowledge
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Magnus Ahlkvist
## Title: It depends - don't mistake your Google search for my database knowledge
## Abstract:
### "It depends". The answer to most questions about database development and database design. In this 60 minute session I will go through some "smart" solutions which turned out to be performance killers in the end. I will also try kill some myths about "best practices" in database development.
My powerpoints usually look terrible, so I will focus on T-SQL and execution plans.

## Speaker: Jose Manuel Jurado Diaz
## Title: Azure SQL Database - Lessons learned from the trenches
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn the best practices, tips and tricks on how to successfully use Azure SQL Database on production environments. You will learn how to monitor and improve Azure SQL Database query performance. I will cover how Microsoft CSS has been using Query Store, Extended Events, DMVs to help customers monitor and improve query response times when running their databases in the Microsoft Azure cloud. These learnings are fruit of Microsoft CSS support cases, and customer field engagements. This session includes several demos

# SQL Server Availability Groups for dummies
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Mark Broadbent
## Title: SQL Server Availability Groups for dummies
## Abstract:
### Availability Groups have become Microsoft’s default high availability and scalability go-to solution for SQL Server, but due to their relative complexity is often misunderstood, or worse, feared. 

In this session, we will explain how to plan for, deploy, and manage Availability Groups from the ground up in easy to understand examples and demos.

We will cover both Basic Availability Groups (BAGs) and full deployments, and also cover their use in Windows and Linux environments as well as look at the new SQL Server 2019 availability group support on containers in a Kubernetes cluster.

If you want to finally get to grips with SQL Server Always On Availability Groups, then this is the session for you!

## Speaker: Pau Sempere
## Title: Churn Norris: Retain your customers with Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Your customers are your friends, and you should keep your friends as close as possible. To avoid them leaving your side and keep on building that precious friendship, come to this session where we will review the concept of churn or customer retention, what defines such situations and how to predict (and reducing) them using Machine Learning techniques

# What the Hekaton?!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: What the Hekaton?!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Hekaton, aka In-Memory OLTP, will completely change the way you think about data management. As a DBA, you’ll need to analyze your memory and storage needs completely differently. In this session, I will show you the in-memory architecture for your Hekaton data and indexes, and discuss what gets written to disk during checkpoints, as well as what gets logged. Finally, I’ll go into detail on just what it is that makes Hekaton so much FASTER!

# Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks
## Abstract:
### Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions. 

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors - something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.

# The future of serverless computing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Anton Boyko
## Title: The future of serverless computing
## Abstract:
### Are you still planning your servers capacity in CPU and RAM? Do you enjoy answering questions like “what amount of servers we need to buy to serve 10K and 10M users”? Do you enjoy paying for those servers while they are sitting idle?

In my session I will talk about the current state and the future of serverless computing. I will show several demos that show how to start using serverless computing, what are the application scenarios for it, how it can scale, what it will cost, etc.

This session will be useful for developers and architects who are seeking a way to create an app utilizing all your previous skills, but make it scalable, reliable, fast and cost efficient.

# Construct Visual Data Flows by using Azure Data Factory
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Ted Malone
## Title: Construct Visual Data Flows by using Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Moving and transforming data has always been, and will always likely be, a very large part of the day-to-day operational requirements of a data analytics practitioner.  Cloud technologies and "Big Data" have complicated this task to a degree, and understanding how to effectively and efficiently produce ETL/ELT data pipelines is a necessary skill in today's data landscape. 

In this session, attendees will be introduced to Azure Data Factory Mapping Dataflows, which allows users to develop comprehensive data pipelines using a graphical interface. These pipelines are executed in Azure Databricks, which provides a very efficient Spark-based execution context. Attendees will learn how to effectively build visual pipelines using common transformations, and will learn how to monitor and debug ETL and ELT pipelines by using Azure Data Factory.

# AQP vs IQP - query optimization on steroids
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Damian Widera
## Title: AQP vs IQP - query optimization on steroids
## Abstract:
### Adaptive or Intelligent? Maybe both? SQL Server 2017 has come into the light packed with automated query tuning based on the Query Store and Plan Cache. 
SQL Server 2019 has a lot more important features like  =batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptative joins, deferred compilation and approximate query processing. So now we have entered the Intelligent Query Processing world!.

I would like to present both the AQP and IQP to show what you can expect in the nearest future and how these features help your queries running faster

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#898-Gothenburg-2019)
Event Date: 14-09-2019 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Aleksandar Talev
## Title: How to choose the right data model: SQL Server or Azure Cosmos DB. Which, When and Where ?
## Abstract:
### When it comes to choosing a database, always there are considerations about picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both are viable options, there are certain key differences between these two options that users must keep in mind.This session will cover the most important distinctions and will make a difference between two of a key players in the Microsoft database world: SQL Server and Azure Cosmos DB.  The session will also illustrate some of the fundamental differences between these databases - the language, scalability and structure which cause this distinctions to have  implications for the right choice.So which database is right for your business the attendance will take informations in this session.

## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019
## Abstract:
### As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.

## Speaker: Kamil Nowinski
## Title: Move part of your body to Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Azure is cheaper, Azure is faster, Azure is more secure. Azure... everywhere is Azure. Data is everywhere.
Even if not today, certainly in the future (yes, believe me) you will face a case: how to move my data from on-premise Data Warehouse to Azure.
This session will reveal the ideas of how to do that, how to recognise if you are ready, what the best practices are and other important things we should be aware of. I will describe potential issues and give you hints on how to avoid them.
Finally, I will present one tool that can help you in preparation and also we will see what speed we can achieve during a migration.
