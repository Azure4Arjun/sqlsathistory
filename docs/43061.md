## Speaker: Gary Schultz
## Title: SSMS Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### This is a 100 level session that anyone who uses SQL Server Management Studio (developers and DBA's alike) may find helpful.   We will demonstrate several features that are somewhat hidden, such as split screens, Tab groups, block replacement, RegEx, multi-server queries, SQL Command Mode, templates, query organization tips, connection coloring,  Object Explorer Details,  and a few FREE add-ins that will make a DBA's job more simple and more productive.   I presented the session at work and got the following email from a developer:  "Very good presentation today. I've been using SSMS daily for almost 10 years and I was surprised by the number of new tricks I learned."
