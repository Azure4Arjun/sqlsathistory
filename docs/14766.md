## Title: Query Tuning in the Clouds
## Abstract:
### Just because you're using an Azure SQL database does not mean you can avoid tuning queries. Microsoft has throttling in place that could seriously impact your systems if your queries are using up lots of resources. This session will introduce you to the tools you have available to identify poor performing queries, such as dynamic management objects and others. You'll learn how to understand why a query is running slow using the Azure Portal execution plans. This understanding will enable you to fix your poorly performing queries.  All in the cloud.
