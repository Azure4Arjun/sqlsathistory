## Speaker: Bayer White
## Title: Getting Started with AppFabric Caching (Velocity)
## Abstract:
### Let's face it, reading and writing data with SQL Server can be expensive and has scaling this type of architecture has its implications that need to be considered upfront. This is one of the reasons Microsoft has included caching within its future AppFabric Framework. Caching is not a new methodology because we can use it currently in applications built on top of ASP.Net out of the box, however there are still scaling issues that AppFabric Caching (ACF), formerly Velocity addresses. As database developers, it is important to identify with new trends that may affect database integration and this presentation does just that. First we will learn the basics of AFC, how to install, how to scale, and how data driven solutions can benefit from it.

## Abstract:
### SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views.  The execution plans are a gold mine of information.  From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek.  Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your finger tips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases.

Prerequisites
Understanding of basic T-SQL coding
Understanding of basic XQuery statements

Goals:
1.	Discuss information available in an execution plan
2.	Demonstrate use of XQuery to query execution cache

# Access SQL Back-End Gets Better Option

## Speaker: Kathy Malone
## Title: Access SQL Back-End Gets Better Option
## Abstract:
### Hear how Access 2010 and SharePoint 2010 can be used to better manage your Access applications, reducing the load on your SQL Server.  SharePoint 2010 manages security, backup, and deployment of the Access aps, and makes it possible to use the Access ap in the browser without having Access on the client machine and in untrusted mode.   And because of the way Access now caches, it becomes a tool of choice for large number of records queries and reports (40,000-160,000 records), reducing the load on your SQL Servers.  Finally, see a tool for finding the Access applications in your environment so you can prioritize making them more managed.

# SQL Server Service Broker
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#32-Tampa-2010)

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server Service Broker
## Abstract:
### We will take a look at SQL Service Broker, the built-in asynchronous messaging subsystem provided with SQL Server.  We will examine new terminology as well as get a grounding in how we can setup and use Service Broker for messaging applications.  We live in an increasingly interconnected world and having a system that can handle intermittent connections and asynchronous processing can solve many business problems.  And if MySpace can use it to pass hundreds of millions of messages around their system per day, it can probably do whatever you need it to do as well!  Plenty of code in this presentation too.
