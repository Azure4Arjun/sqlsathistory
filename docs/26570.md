## Speaker: Tim Costello
## Title: Source Code Control: Revision management for the data dude.
## Abstract:
### Ever wanted to see what has changed since the last time you looked, or work with someone else and realize you've both changed the same stored procedure?   Do you really enjoy searching through folder after folder of obscure .sql files to find the query you might or might not have saved last week?  There is a better way, and it doesn't have to be a hassle.  In this session we'll look at why you would want a revision management system and options (build or buy, free or fee) to implement one for yourself or your team.
