## Title: MongoDB and SQL Server 2019: The Odd Couple
## Abstract:
### Microsoft is pulling out all the stops when it comes to SQL Server 2019 integration with "Big Data" solutions. With the expansion of PolyBase to handle external data in MongoDB, moving data from "unstructured" documents into relational tables in SQL Server is theoretically simple. However, MongoDB is designed to allow for spontaneous schema changes. Our fussy SQL Server won't like such sloppiness! In this session, we will explore SQL Server 2019 features, such as PolyBase, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and T-SQL features such as JSON support, that facilitate integration with MongoDB. The demonstration will include moving data between our Odd Couple of database paradigms, and building in safeguards to keep the two systems from having issues. Can two incompatible databases share data without driving each other crazy?
