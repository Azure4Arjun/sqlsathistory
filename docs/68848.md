## Speaker: Jasmine Miller
## Title: Business Intelligence with R and Python
## Abstract:
### With the integration of R into SQL Server 2016, and now Python into SQL Server 2017, this presentation will dive into the differences between the two languages, what they are best suited for, and highlight key features and packages within both for descriptive and predictive analytics. Application of SQL statements will be demonstrated within RStudio/Jupyter notebooks, as opposed to within SQL Server, in order to demonstrate its multi-purpose use across all platforms (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
