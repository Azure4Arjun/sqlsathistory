## Title: Oracle vs. SQL Server-  The War of the Indices
## Abstract:
### This session is for the love of technology and learning.  Its based off research performed on objects, design and code built as similar as possible to see how Oracle and SQL Server compare in performance, usage and storage of indices.  Environments were built on-prem and in the cloud to view differences in different cloud support of database engines and based off trusted measurements in each platform so as to dig into how the use case was built, the similarities and the differences in each. 

Based off this use case, enhanced builds of more advanced index features and discussions of the advantages, reasons for the introduction and how it's effected the direction of each product, the DBAs who are responsible for them and resources. 

Takeaways are:
1.	Receive a strong education on platform differences between Oracle and SQL Server.
2.	Discover hidden insight on index storage and costs.
3.	Learn about great tips on maintaining index health
