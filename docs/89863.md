## Title: Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… :)

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages or ADF pipelines, this is the right session for you!
