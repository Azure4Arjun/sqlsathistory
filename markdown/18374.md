## Title: SQL Server 2012/2014 Columnstore index
## Abstract:
### It might seem far-feched that a company would upgrade to SQL Server 2012/2014 “just” for a database index.  But after you see the performance enhancements gained from the new columnstore index in SQL Server 2012/2014, you’ll see why many are calling this one of the most important features in the history of SQL Server.  In this presentation, I’ll talk about the physical aspects of  columnstore index in SQL Server 2012/2014, how to create it, and what environments  (mainly data warehousing environments) and queries can make use of it.  I’ll show performance benchmarks between columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012/2014, and compare them to index strategies prior to SQL Server 2012.  I'll also show how the new Batch execution mode can improve performance as well.  Finally, I'll cover some of the 2014 specific enhancements to the columnstore index.
