### Toss Adventure Works and Project Real, this is SEC territory and football rules.  This 'no holds barred session' will be a rapid fire creation of a Microsoft Business Intelligence solution from source data (NCAA Football statistics) to surfacing the data with Microsoft tools.  The audience will get a first-hand overview of the dimensional modeling process, ETL, SQL Server Analysis Services and finally creating a UI for our data.  All of the source code for the session will be made available for use after the session for anybody passionate enough about college football to maintain their own databaset.
