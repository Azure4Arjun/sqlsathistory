## Title: Turbo-Charged Transaction Logs
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood components of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long start-up times, problems with the transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log works and how to optimize its performance. You'll learn how to determine the right settings for maximum throughput, and what to do when things get out of control.
