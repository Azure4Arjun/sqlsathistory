In this session you will see the new Microsoft Business Intelligence Platform: Power BI. We will we will make a tour around the platform and in particular see how it connects with other services (both Microsoft and third-party) to obtain data. After this general tour you will see a very particular demo, about how a very “peculiar” company solves its problems using the Power BI platform and then tell the reality of a company that sells condoms and wants to know where to offer their products best. Fun guaranteed!
