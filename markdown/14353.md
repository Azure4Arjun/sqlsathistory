## Title: Poor Man's GIS using Tabular and Power View
## Abstract:
### Technical "how to" for property-related projects completed for my employer - City of Jacksonville.  Using data in creative ways, I was able to use SQL, Tabular (DAX) and the mapping capabilities of Power View to create an effective map presentation of city properties that were under-utilized, considered "blight" or otherwise required special attention.  Users can visualize properties with liens, vacant, City-owned, Schools,etc. on the same map (with the address, of course), filtering the map by zip code or city council district.
