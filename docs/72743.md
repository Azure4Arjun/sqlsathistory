## Title: Spot the Potential Breakpoints in your Automated Process
## Abstract:
### We all have automated processes that were built in a rush and as long as everything is right, it works very well.  Then, several months later, after you have shoved the relevant knowledge about it to the corner of your brain, something happens that you didnt expect and the process fails.  You fix it, and it works again, but something else comes up and it breaks again.  This interactive presentation helps to show how to identify the potential break-points in a proces.  We will review 2 case scenarios: SFTP process which pulls files from a vendor and a log shipping process.  For each scenario, we will disect each part of the process and find out where the vulnerabilities are.
