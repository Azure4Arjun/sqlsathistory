## Title: Give me an "M"! Give me another "M"! Give me a... Ok you get the point.
## Abstract:
### The language commonly known as "M" (or Power Query to some) has grown in prevalence over the last 5 years to where it has evolved into a fully integrated language in various tools from far in the front end to way in the back end. Power BI uses it heavily. Cubes can call directly to it.

Come along and learn how the language works and some proposed best practices. With a focus on Power BI optimization but watch as I delve into Data Lake ingestion to Azure Analysis Services and so forth.
