## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: DBA Worst Practices, Disasters and Horror Stories
## Abstract:
### Join SQL Server MVPs and Community Speakers Aaron Betrand, Andy Kelly, Joey D'Antoni and Mike Walsh as we discuss some of the worst practices we often see bite SQL Server environments. Most of these are settings and configurations that are destined to cause headaches from the defaults shipped with SQL Server, some are misunderstandings but all will cause you heartache. This will be a VERY interactive panel discussion. We'll cover a list of worst practices, share horror stories from our own experiences and take plenty of questions from the audience. We'll try and leave time at the end for you to throw your DBA or performance questions at this panel with over 50 years of SQL Server experience.
