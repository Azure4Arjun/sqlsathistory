## Title: Transactional Replication: Tuning and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### At some point in every DBA's career they'll be probably be asked to work with transactional replication but most DBAs don't look under the covers once they're done walking through the setup wizards. In this session we'll take a deeper look at setting up, monitoring, and calibrating transactional publications plus share some tricks and tips gleaned from years of experience working with high volume, multiple datacenter topologies.
Session Goals:
•	Learn how to baseline performance metrics by gleaning information from the distribution database
•	Show how to tune replication agent performance with agent profiles
•	Demonstrate advanced troubleshooting techniques to apply when problems occur
