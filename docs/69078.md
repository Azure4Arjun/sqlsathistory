## Title: Cardinality Estimator with SQL Server 2014 and 2016 [EN]
## Abstract:
### Cardinality Estimator had a major upgrade in SQL Server 2014 version and 2016. After a few introductory words, I will speak about model assumptions of Cardinality Estimator, calculation direction, model selection of Cardinality Estimator and improvements in SQL Server versions 2014 and 2016. I will also have a few demos where I will demonstrate how to optimally use the new features.
