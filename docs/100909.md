## Title: Database CI/CD with Containers and Azure DevOps
## Abstract:
### Containers are becoming ever popular but other than spinning one up to have a play around with the latest SQL Server 2019 CTP's new features, what else can they be used for?

In this demo heavy session we will show how Containers along with Azure DevOps can work for your CI/CD pipeline.

You will leave this session with the knowledge and ability to start creating your own bespoke SQL Server on Linux development / testing environments with automated image builds and releasing to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) along with some of the issues / pitfalls of doing so. 

Pre-Requisite:
To get the most out of this session a basic understanding of what Docker/Containers are, is recommended.
