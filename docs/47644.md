## Speaker: Jason Picker
## Title: In BI, one size does not fit all
## Abstract:
### Don’t be fooled by a vendor’s claims that their BI tool is all you need to solve your organization’s business intelligence needs.  In this session we will discuss the varied business intelligence needs of an organization and how to solve them.  Understand the differences between reporting and analytics and between self-service needs and the needs of IT.  We will see examples of using the best tools for the best job and bringing them together in a unified interface.
