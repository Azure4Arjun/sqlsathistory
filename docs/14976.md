## Title: Merge Replicaton Internals
## Abstract:
### Merge Replication allows you to replicate data bi-directionally. It is designed for occasionally connected data islands which need to aggreate data centrally, and vice versa. This session covers merge replication internals, conflicts, resolvers including the business logic and stored procedure resolver, dynamic and static filtering and how to handle identity ranges.
