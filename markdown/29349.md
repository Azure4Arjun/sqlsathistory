## Speaker: Brandon Tucker
## Title: SSIS + DBAs = ?
## Abstract:
### Who said Integration Services was just for developers and BI folk?  In this session, we'll cover a few basics in SSIS that can allow DBAs to leverage the beauty of this tool for everyday tasks.  We will discuss how we can create a repository of server information, iterate over a list of servers, and deploy packages such that they can run in an automated fashion.
