## Title: Adding User Configurations to an Analysis Server Cube
## Abstract:
### Any analysis of a business's operations is going to include some proprietary values or conversion factors that only that industry or particular company will understand. And, it is likely that those values will need to be specific to some aspect of the business. In this session we'll look at several different ways to add user configurable values and conversion factors to an Analysis Server cube. We'll use some advanced T-SQL querying functions to produce a solution that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
