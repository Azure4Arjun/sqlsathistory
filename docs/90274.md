## Title: Faster Transactions: Query Tuning for Data Manipulation
## Abstract:
### Your server has dozens of CPUs, terabytes of RAM, and solid-state drives, and yet your UPDATE query still takes hours. Why? In this demo-filled session we will discuss common pitfalls for any SQL professional who is manipulating large sets of data with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Not only will you learn about potential issues involving data pages, locks, and the transaction log, but also what techniques you can use to improve performance.
