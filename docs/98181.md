## Title: Data Privacy and Data Security in a Data-Driven world
## Abstract:
### New advances in technology coupled with the rate of change in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Privacy and Ethics at the forefront of public consciousness â€“ forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained, and constantly evaluated. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial Intelligence, and big data processing are providing new business opportunities that must also account for privacy and ethics issues while maintaining a balance with compliance, security, and integrity of data. 
But what are the issues that individual data professionals should be aware of to avoid reputational damage to their companies and themselves? And what are the tools that can help them in their endeavors? 

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks.
