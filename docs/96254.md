## Title: Power BI: From Zero to 101
## Abstract:
### Power BI is one of the leading Microsoft's BI technologies today and because its share is steadily grows on the job market, every IT professional and especially these, who work with data, should know at least basics of it. But what do YOU know about it? Do you know that Power BI provides very cool reports with dynamic diagrams on very beautiful dashboards? Do you know that you can feed to Power BI almost any types of data? Do you know that you can run Power BI on premise as weel as Power BI Service in the cloud? What else do you know about Power BI? Just several months ago I knew only those basics and despite of Power BI being very visual it was not easy to learn new technology. I still know only the basics, which should help me to deliver that session to the audience without going very deep. However, those basics are already enough to build really powerful Power BI dashboards. I'll share my practical knowledge in demos, will tell you about problems I've had and how I overcome them.
