## Title: Using Open Source Software to Collect Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store to track what queries are running. Then, we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive and easy to set up system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances, Azure Managed Instances, and Azure SQL Databases. Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize it interactively, and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issues. Finally, we will look at a problem I solved using this solution as an example.
