## Title: Mental Health and Wellness in IT: Safeguarding our most precious resource
## Abstract:
### One in four Americans suffers from a mental health challenge each year. In the tech community, this number rises to 42%. The stigma associated with discussions around mental health, as well as how it can negatively impact your work and home life, make people reluctant to discuss the topic. Now is the time to start discussing mental health in tech and how to take advantage of the opportunity to safeguard our most precious resource: people. We'll discuss how mental health affects job quality, including sharing examples from my professional life. We'll discuss the four primary workplace factors which play a pivotal role in mental health challenges in the tech community. I'll provide tips on what is best to say and not say to people you know whose lives are being affected by their mental health. Lastly, we'll cover how to make your workplace a safe place where mental health can be talked about and how to encourage your company to offer resources to help maintain everyone's mental health.
