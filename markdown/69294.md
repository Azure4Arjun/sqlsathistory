## Title: SQL Server 2016 and R Service introduction
## Abstract:
### Introduction of R in SQL Server R service
One of the biggest changes in SQL Server 2016 on the analytics front is the inclusion of R into the database engine.  SQL Server R Services is the result of Microsoft’s acquisition of Revolution Analytics. R is a popular open-source data analysis language that’s used by data scientists, statisticians and data analysts for data analysis, data exploration and predictive modeling. R can produce both data analytic results and data visualizations. However, in the past, the use of R in an enterprise environment involved several challenges. By marrying R with its core data platform, Microsoft is signaling that it is serious about advancing its analytic offerings not only in the cloud, but on-premise as well. This presentation will tell why it’s important for SQL developer to know R and vice versa.
