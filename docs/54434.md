## Title: Remove Repetitive SQL Agent Jobs from Your Plate, from Your Plate
## Abstract:
### Learn how to centrally automate and manage repetitive SQL jobs across your entire SQL Server environment. We’ll show you how to use JAMS to add intuitive scheduling logic, triggers, dependencies, and source control to critical SQL batch processes. We’ll demonstrate how JAMS helps companies overcome some of the most common challenges associated with scheduling, monitoring, and reporting using native SQL Agent tools. 

Plus, we’ll explore some of the ways JAMS can integrate SQL processes into cross-platform workflows that extend across numerous business applications and scripts outside the SQL environment.
