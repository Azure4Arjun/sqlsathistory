## Title: Troubleshooting SQL IO issues with Xperf
## Abstract:
### Xperf is a light weight performance tracing tool based on Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).   The tool can help troubleshoot notoriously difficult SQL Server issues such as determining the root cause of slow IO's and high privileged time on the sql server process.   Xperf can help bridge the gap between SQL tracing and kernel tracing to give insight into these types of issues that previously was unavailable.  We will look at how Xperf works and how to configure it for different issues.   We'll then step through using Xperf to determine the root cause of a 15 second IO error.
