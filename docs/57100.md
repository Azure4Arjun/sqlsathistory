## Title: Tuning Problem Queries in Table Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Table partitioning is a fantastic tool to help you manage tables with skyrocketing rowcounts. SQL Server 2016 SP1 made table partitioning available in Standard Edition, so you may be planning to add partitioning to your database. But some queries may get slower after you partition your tables: the SQL Server optimizer doesn't always use indexes the same way after those indexes are partitioned into chunks. In this session you will learn how to use execution plans to troubleshoot regressed queries using partitioned tables. You will learn what "non-aligned" indexes are, how to tell how many partitions a query is really using, and a variety of methods to speed up your queries.
