# High-Performance Statistical Queries
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#601---Belgrade-2017)
Event Date: 18-03-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: High-Performance Statistical Queries
## Abstract:
### Transact-SQL language in latest editions of SQL Server has so many business intelligence (BI) improvements that it might become your primary analytic database system. You might even decide to use T-SQL for advanced analyses directly, without including R, SSAS or Azure ML. However, to get the maximum out of these language constructs, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows extremely efficient statistical queries that use the new window functions and are optimized through algorithms that use mathematical knowledge and creativity. During the session, the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures are explained as well. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries. Or maybe you want to become a data scientist? Then you need to know statistics and programming. You get the best of both in this session.

## Speaker: Jovan Popovic
## Title: SQL Server and JSON in real applications
## Abstract:
### JSON support that was introduced in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database enables you to get the best both from relational and NoSQL worlds. You can easily combine relational design that provides high query performance and non-relational concepts that provide you flexibility and rapid development to create optimal design for your application.
In this session, we will see how you can combine relational data and JSON, query and index JSON data, load semi-structured data from log files, create REST/OData services, and easily integrate your database with modern web apps.

## Title: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithms
## Abstract:
### Machine learning service is Microsoft Azure drag and drop tool for building,testing and deploying any kind of predictive model on your data-set. Finalized solution is published and used by daily business in larger stack of your Microsoft Azure services. With easy and interactive creation of models, algorithms and decisions do not tend to be that simple! Especially when one has to make business decision on results.

Focus on this session will be mathematical and graphical explanation of algorithms available for predictive analytics in Azure Machine Learning service. Algorithms - grouped by learning type - will be examined and crossed referenced through all available and ready-to-use. Understanding the the basics - data inference, data splitting, data stratification, to sweeping, to theory of algorithms: regression, decision trees, Clustering and Naive Bayes. We will clarify the confusion over algorithms, suitable data for algorithms and what type of problem can be tackled with.
