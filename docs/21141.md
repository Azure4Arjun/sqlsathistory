## Title: 101 Stupid Things Your Colleagues Do When Setting Up SQL Server
## Abstract:
### There are some things that you just wish your colleagues had known before they installed an instance of SQL Server.  Next, Next, Next, Done. Right? NO!!! The stink from that just doesn't go away.  In this session you'll learn which default settings can come back to haunt you as well as best-practice configurations for the entire infrastructure stack (Hardware, Storage, Virtualization, OS, and SQL Server) to ensure performance.  This session is for the accidental DBA or anyone who needs to install SQL Server occasionally (or for their colleagues who need to mop up afterwards).
