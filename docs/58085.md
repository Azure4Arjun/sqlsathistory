## Title: Meta-Data Driven Tabular Modeling with TOM in SSAS
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services 2016 uses JSON as a format to store the metadata of a model and you can change it with C# using TOM (Tabular Object Model). The new object model has a one-to-one mapping between physical entities in the database and objects in the model. This is very usefull if you need to add or change measures without redeploying the whole project to server.
For example, you need to generate set of new measures every year or end users want to add measures themselves and so on.  Using TOM and meta-data table you can automate this process and save tons of time. Join this session for learning how to implement this.
