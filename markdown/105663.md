## Abstract:
### Data virtualization with SQL Server 2019 PolyBase
SQL Server has provided features like linked servers, replication, and integration services to integrate data from other data sources. In this session we will learn about the improvements to PolyBase in SQL Server 2019, which allows you to extend the querying capability to data sources like SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, Hadoop CDH, and other data sources. You also get insights on the design, capabilities, and performance advantages of PolyBase, save ETL Processes as follows:
•	Installing and Configuring PolyBase Windows  Linux 
•	Connecting to Hadoop
•	Using Predicate Pushdown to Enhance Query Performance
•	Packet Capture With\Without Predicate Pushdown
•	When to use  Predicate Pushdown
•	Limitations on Pushdown with Complex Filters
•	MapReduce Vs Pushdown

Built-In Integrations: Oracle, MongoDB , Radis and More
Integrating via ODBC  : Apache Spark , Apache Hive, Microsoft Excel
