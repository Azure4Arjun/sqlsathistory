## Title: Introduction to System Catalog Views and System Dynamic Management Views
## Abstract:
### System Catalog Views are all about the catalog METADATA in your database. Using basic T-SQL queries they let you look for objects in the database such as Tables, Stored Procedures, Functions, and more. System Dynamic Management Views let you monitor the health of your server instance and database, assist in performance tuning and diagnosing problems. Both can be core sources of information that let you do your job faster and better. Sure, on the surface they can seem rather mundane, but they can save your bacon when your database goes sidewise and you have no idea what’s going on. Join me as we begin our flight at 50,000 feet exploring many of the different types of views available and what they can provide you, then push the yoke forward and dive toward the ground to get a closer look at several in detail. But don’t worry, just as it looks like we’re going to crash and burn we’ll pull back on the yoke and slide in to a smooth landing.
