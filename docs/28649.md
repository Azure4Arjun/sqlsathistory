## Speaker: Andrew Brust
## Title: Self-Service Business Intelligence-MS PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder why there’s no “light” version of SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)?  Find yourself wishing that SSAS offered an in-memory operation model akin to some of its competitors?  And why are OLAP cubes nearly impossible for end-users to build while comparable capabilities have existed for relational databases for at least 15 years?  Enter Microsoft’s product code-named “Gemini,” a component of the upcoming SQL Server 2008 R2 release, that joins together SSAS, Excel and SharePoint to make end-user analytics feasible, fun, publishable and discoverable by IT.  Andrew Brust will show you how it all works in this not-to-miss session.
