## Title: VLDB Tips and Migration Tactics
## Abstract:
### Are your databases growing? Most likely they are but what do you have to do differently when they reach VLDB (>1TB) in size? I currently manage and have recently migrated terabyte sized databases (~30TB) to SQL Server 2016. In this session, people will learn how they need to change their thinking when it comes to bread and butter DBA tasks like daily and weekly maintenance, patching, restores and monitoring. I will also share many lessons learned and strategies from migrating from an older version of SQL Server to a newer version like SQL Server 2016. Afterwards people will have a greater sense of confidence that they too can manage and migrate VLDB(s).
