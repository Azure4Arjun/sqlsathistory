# Plan Cache performance tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-745)
Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Arthur Daniels III
## Title: Plan Cache performance tuning
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve performance in the Plan Cache will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.

## Speaker: Ameena Lalani
## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Jessica Jolly
## Title: Relax! It's just DAX.
## Abstract:
### DAX is the language you use when working in Power BI or Power Query to create calculations using your data. 
At first, it may seem intimidating, but the truth is that if you have been using functions in Excel, you have the basic knowledge to help you get started in DAX.
The first half of this session will introduce basic DAX terminology and concepts. In the second half, participants can use their own laptop and work on a demo data set, creating some beginner DAX statements. 
The experts in DAX say that DAX is an easy language to learn, and a hard language to master. DAX may be easy to learn (although that hasn't been this speaker's experience!), but it is definitely hard to carve out a chunk of time to try out a new skill. This is your chance! At the end of the session, I will also share a list of resources, including books, videos, and blogs for you to continue your journey into DAX.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?
## Abstract:
### Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.

# The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-745)
Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Amy Herold
## Title: The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
## Abstract:
### There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.

# Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets

## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
## Abstract:
### You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-745)
Event Date: 11-08-2018 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support
## Abstract:
### What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems.

## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: Ten Things Power BI Can Do for Your Business
## Abstract:
### In the world of data, we spend much of our time talking about software, and for good reason: the modern wave of tools is dramatically superior to the tools of even five years ago. But there’s a related question that bears revisiting: WHAT should we be doing with those tools? While that may seem like an obvious question, the very existence of the revolutionary new tools makes now a great time to revisit the fundamentals of how we view our relationship with data. 

Spoiler alert: many of the obvious valuable things were prohibitively difficult to execute using previous tools – so much so that we’ve forgotten what we should be doing! The speaker (Rob Collie) has seen it all in the process of helping literally hundreds of organizations revolutionize their relationships with data, and in this thought-provoking and non-technical talk, he will share 10 recurring and valuable patterns observed within the past 2-3 years.

## Speaker: Chris Lumnah
## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
## Abstract:
### Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.
