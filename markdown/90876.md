## Title: Complex Azure Orchestration with Dynamic Data Factory Pipelines
## Abstract:
### If you have already mastered the basics of Azure Data Factory (ADF) and are now looking to advance your knowledge of the tool this is the session for you. Yes, Data Factory can handle the orchestration of our ETL pipelines. But what about our wider Azure environment? In this session weâ€™ll go beyond the basics looking at how we build custom activities, metadata driven dynamic design patterns for Data Factory. Plus, considerations for optimising compute costs by controlling other service scaling as part of normal data processing. Once we can hit a REST API with an ADF web activity anything is possible, extending our Data Factory and orchestrating everything.
