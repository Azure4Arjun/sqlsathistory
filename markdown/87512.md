## Title: Becoming a Data Scientist
## Abstract:
### You’ve all heard about data scientists, and seen job postings for them.  But what is the job like, really?  Let me share the story of my first official data science project.  While sharing the story I’ll stop to point out the skills used that many DBAs, PowerShell junkies, BI developers and architects already have. There may be a few new topics you’ll want to pick up.  This is a show and tell session.  It’s my hope that you come away with a better understanding of what a data scientist is, and be able to measure how far between where you are and your own first project.
