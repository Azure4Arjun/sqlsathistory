## Title: Mining XML Query Plans
## Abstract:
### Execution plans contain a lot of information that can guide you in your performance tuning process. Since SQL 2005 it is possible to retrieve the execution plans stored in the cache using DMVs and DMFs. However, as they are stored in XML format it can be cumbersome and difficult to extract the information you need. In this session, you will learn how the XML query plan is structured and how to use SQL Serverâ€™s built-in XQuery language to extract information. Examples include indexes that the optimizer indicates would increase performance if implemented and queries that use table scans or nested loop joins.
