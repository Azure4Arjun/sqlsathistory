## Title: Ah, ha, how do you automate database administration?
## Abstract:
### A typical enterprise database environment comprise of hundreds of database server hosts. Each host has at least the following database administrator's tasks:

	User database full backup
	System database full backup
	Transaction Log backup
	Check database integrity
	Index defragmentation and update statistics
	Backup cleanup per retention policy
	Backup history and agent history cleanup

	Quick N Easy recovery strategy

SQL Server native environment, the maintenance plan, is not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios and is not friendly enough to debug. While CMS environment is great, it is not possible to automate via User Graphical Interface.
I use CMS, T-SQL and Powershell custom solution to construct a worry-free, stable, easy-deploy DBA task plan and automated monitoring alert notifications including backup failure, backup reports and sql agent job failure.
These maybe the processes that future SQL Server version could incorporate as a standard.
