## Title: What's New with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory version 2 was launched into public beta at the end of 2017. It takes the best features of version 1 and adds new features like time execution triggers, Azure Data Lake activities and the ability to execute SSIS packages in Azure Data Factory. In this session we'll do a walk-through of how the product has evolved, and help you understand the full feature set available in version 2. You'll also understand how to lift and shift your SSIS packages to Azure Data Factory.
