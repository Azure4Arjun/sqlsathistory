## Title: Multi-Tenant Data Warehousing and ETL in Azure
## Abstract:
### The traditional monolithic data warehouse and supporting ETL can be difficult to design, tedious to develop and expensive if running in Microsoft Azure.  What happens when your source systems can replicate as new customers come online, and they demand their data be available in a warehouse for reporting with minimal intervention?  In this session, we will walk through a real world project using SQL Server and SSIS running in Microsoft Azure.  Attendees can expect to learn some different techniques for use in their own ETL and warehousing projects as well as some of the pitfalls of building a data warehouse stored in SQL Azure.
