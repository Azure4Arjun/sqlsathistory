## Title: SQL Server Performance Analysis
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning is something that every DBA and developer will have to do at some point.  You'll find all kinds of recipes, cookbook, and processes to do performance tuning.  The hardest part isn't tuning something, it is figuring out what to tune and what is worth tuning in the first place.  Many people don't have the time to do performance tuning, because so much time is spent figuring out what to tune that no time is left to actually tune the code.  This session will take you through all of the tools necessary to gather the data necessary to do the analysis as well as how to quickly cut through all of the background noise to zero in on the most important things that need to be tuned.
