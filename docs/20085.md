## Speaker: Mark Stacey
## Title: Analysis Services for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs have heard the term Analysis Services, but don't really know what it's for or who would use it. In this session, Mark will explain the use cases for Analysis Services, illustrate how it improves performance for large data sets and eases report writing, and will go through a practical example of building a first Analysis Services solution.This session will be practical for SQL 2005 through 2008 R2, but he will also take the time to explain what changes in SQL 2012 and Tabular mode.
