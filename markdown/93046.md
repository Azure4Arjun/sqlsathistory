## Title: Help Me SSIS Logging, You're My Only Hope!
## Abstract:
### When something goes wrong with your SSIS package and you need to tell your boss more than "I have a bad feeling about thisâ€¦", let the Force of SSIS logging save you from the dark side!

SSIS logging may be the last thing on your mind when starting a new project, but getting it right in the beginning is well worth your while.  Logging can help troubleshoot errors, tackle inefficiencies, and even raise a red flag when there are issues in your data flow.  Newer versions of SQL Server have brought new options for logging.  Learn what information is available for each option along with how to implement custom logging when the built-in options aren't robust enough for your project's needs.
