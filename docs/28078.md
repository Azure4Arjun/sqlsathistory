## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect, SQL Server MVP, and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
