## Title: You did WHAT to my transaction log?!
## Abstract:
### You won't believe what people will do to the transaction log when they get into trouble. The log is full! The application is experiencing strange errors! Do something! In this session, I will apply commonly suggested advice from internet search results and various forums, in search of a fast remedy for explosive log growth. How bad could it be?!

I will illustrate with simple graphics exactly what's in the transaction log, and why it is fundamental to SQL Server's ability to ensure that the associated database is always in a consistent state. I will explain the factors that can prevent reuse of log space and how to tackle the root causes of rapid log growth, rather than simply alleviating the symptoms using dangerous quick fixes. I'll also offer tips on how to avoid excessive logging becoming a bottleneck, and affecting the performance of user transactions.
