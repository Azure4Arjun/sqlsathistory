## Title: Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Power BI, Power Automate, and Power Apps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Microsoft 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Server.
