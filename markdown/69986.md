## Title: Azure Analysis Services rocks!
## Abstract:
### Azure Analysis Services has been in the cloud for a few months and it rocks!

This session will cover fundamentals of using Azure Analysis Services. I will go through the new capabilities of the service and compare it with the SQL Server Analysis Services on-premises.
