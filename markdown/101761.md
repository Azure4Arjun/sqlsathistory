## Title: How to mine data in SharePoint easily, using Power BI
## Abstract:
### See how to use Power BI to mine the data you have in SharePoint and Office 365. We’ll pull data from lists, files in libraries, triggered activities using Microsoft Power Automate, and show how to embed reports in SharePoint/Teams. We will provide a short Power BI licensing overview as well. We’ll also show you how this can be automated so that you save time and money by eliminating a manual process.
