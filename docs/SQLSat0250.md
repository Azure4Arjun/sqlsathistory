# Do Some SOLR Searching with .NET
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-250)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: David Hoerster
## Title: Do Some SOLR Searching with .NET
## Abstract:
### You've designed your application, built it up, and it's working great.  One of the last features to implement is searching and reporting.  You think you can get away with just implementing some SQL LIKE statements for an initial search, but you need to search across many fields or perform faceted searches.  You've put it off because you really don't want to deal with SQL Server Full-Text Indexing - maybe it's not your cup of tea or maybe it's just intimidating or maybe you're not using SQL Server.  But there are alternatives to Full-Text Indexing that can be just as powerful and fairly simple.  SOLR is one such open source tool to help you with your application's searching needs.  We'll take a look at the SOLR project, how you can get it up and running very easily, how you can install it as a Windows Service (as opposed to a command window), and how you can use SOLR.net to program against it.  We'll look at basic searches along with some cool features like faceting.

# Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-250)
Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX
## Abstract:
### A large volume of analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. For example, you may need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time.  DAX incorporates many built in time intelligence functions to help make date-time based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very beneficial, they can be misused and give erroneous results.This session is guides you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to use them.

In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.

Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: John Sterrett
## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for your Big Data Problems.
## Abstract:
### Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. In this session you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Speaker: Steve Hood
## Title: Monitoring and Baselines
## Abstract:
### During an incident you can look at every stat in SQL Server, but if you don’t know what normal is for that specific server then they won’t be very useful to you.  Also, outside of incidents, it’s very beneficial to know what your most expensive queries are for the month instead of since the last recompile, or seeing when your page life expectancy drops instead of just noticing it’s low.  Without proactively monitoring SQL Server you’re making your job more difficult and less productive at the same time.

This will cover OS Perf Counters, Wait Stats, Traces, Blocking, Query Stats, Index Stats, Database Sizes and Table Sizes, all presented in a format of what you should be watching and how it will help you.

## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

## Speaker: A.J. Mee
## Title: Analysis Services - Multidimensional vs. PowerPivot vs. Tabular/BISM
## Abstract:
### Remember the days when Analysis Services solely represented an OLAP engine?  Are you unclear about when to still build cubes vs. invoke the new Tabular engine in SSAS?  Do you feel confused about where the self-service capabilities of PowerPivot end and where enterprise BI begins?  If you answered YES to any of those questions, please join A.J. Mee (Principal BI Specialist at Microsoft) for some practical, real-world guidance around the three modes of SQL Server Analysis Services.  As with most of A.J.'s presentations, the vast majority of the time will be spent providing demonstrations of the technology.  Both traditional (i.e. relational) and non-traditional (i.e. unstructured/semi-structured) data sources may be incorporated into the demonstrations.
