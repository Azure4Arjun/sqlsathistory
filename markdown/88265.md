## Title: Azure SQL Managed Instance - Lessons learned from the trenches
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn the best practices, tips and tricks on how to successfully use Azure SQL Database Managed Instance on production environments. You will learn how to monitor and improve Azure SQL Database Managed Instance query performance in comparison to SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. I will cover how Microsoft Support has been using the Query Store, Extended Events, DMVs to help customers monitor and improve query response times when running their databases in this Azure PaaS offering. These learnings are fruit of Microsoft support cases, and customer field engagements. This session is mostly composed of demos.
