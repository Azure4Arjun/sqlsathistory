## Speaker: JK Wood
## Title: Temporary Query Items and You
## Abstract:
### Temporary Tables. Table Variables. Views. CTEs. Derived Tables. All of these are useful for some form of temporarily persisted query or data, but how do you choose between them? Join JK as he works his way through the strengths and weaknesses of each of these items, their scope and their impact on your queries in this demo-heavy session.
