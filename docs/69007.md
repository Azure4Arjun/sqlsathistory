## Title: From SQL to R â€“ Leverage Your T-SQL Knowledge to Learn R
## Abstract:
### You are already familiar with T-SQL and are eager to learn R but do not know where to start? Start from what you already know: T-SQL. Both languages have many things in common on some levels, but are very different on others. You will learn how to begin your first steps in the new language and how to perform the most common tasks, typical for R: statistics, machine learning  data visualization.
This session will kick you off to the new language by using analogies from T-SQL. You will learn how to write your first R-scripts, make usage of packages and will leave this session with a basic understanding of typical use-cases of R and how to integrate that into your existing environment with SQL Server.
