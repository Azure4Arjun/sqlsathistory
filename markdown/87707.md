## Title: Performance Tuning, Getting the Biggest Bang for Your Buck
## Abstract:
### Everyone wants to know if there are magic buttons you can push to make SQL Server run faster, better and more efficiently. In this session we will go over some of my go-to performance tricks that you can implement to get the biggest improvement with the least amount of change.  When it comes to performance tuning, every second counts. We will cover memory optimization, isolation levels, trace flags, statistics, configuration changes and more.  Iâ€™ll go over real life scenarios we come across as consultants and the changes we made to fix them.
