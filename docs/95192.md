## Title: What I Learned Stepping onto the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Previously titled Stumbling and Bumbling onto the Cloud. In this "non-technical" presentation the presenter regales the audience with the missteps, mistakes, and land mines, encountered over the past year in his role as DBA/Data Architect/Data Lackey. 
When your management says “Cloud First” and you’ve got to ask “How high”, and then work your way into actual solutions, it can lead to some real forehead smacking moments. And by “Cloud First”, they mean Azure First and foremost. 
If this sounds like a direction in which you will be headed, or you enjoy Schadenfreude…
Remember a smart person learns from their mistakes, a wise person learns from other people’s mistakes.
