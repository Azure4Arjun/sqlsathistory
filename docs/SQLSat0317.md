## Speaker: Bob Duffy
## Title: Load Testing Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Ever deployed an Analysis Services cube that worked perfectly well with one user on the development server, only to find that it doesn't meet the required volumes of user concurrency?
 
This session focuses on tools and methodology to load test Analysis Services in highly concurrent environments. Including how to locate resource bottlenecks and the appropriate configuration settings that can help improve performance.
 
Sample source code will be supplied to help you load test analysis services. We will be focused on the MOLAP engine, but techniques are equally applicable to the  tabular model.

# Generate SSIS packages automatically with Biml and BimlScript
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#317-Oslo-2014)
Event Date: 30-08-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Generate SSIS packages automatically with Biml and BimlScript
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating the actual SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time.

It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development. In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases and flat files, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed. See why they say Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week!

## Speaker: Erik Flateby
## Title: CUBE-functions for fun  profit
## Abstract:
### CUBE-functions are a little understood and seldomly used feature of Excel, but they have tremendous power for creating high-impact, custom reports that don’t look like pivottables at all. In this demo-rich presentation we start out by giving an introduction to what they actually do, then dive right into how to make them work for us. In the end we will investigate their use with Excel Services, Powerpivot Services and PowerBI.

# Modern Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#317-Oslo-2014)
Event Date: 30-08-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Joe Chang
## Title: Modern Performance
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that hardware today is immensely powerful in all aspects- CPU, memory and even IOPS (with proper configuration). It is less appreciated that in recent versions the SQL Server query optimizer can quickly find a good executions plan from a staggering number of possibilities. And yet it is also generally understood that performance is still an important topic today. This apparent paradox stems from the fact that when mistakes happen in software – especially for database query optimization, it can happen in spectacular fashion. Several examples of SQL that can experience catastrophic performance problems are presented, along with the method of diagnosis and corrective action.

## Speaker: Johan Ludvig Brattås
## Title: Visualization – tales from the field.  How to build a cool Risk Analysis Dashboard on a shoestring
## Abstract:
### Visualization is all the rage – with the focus on Self-Service BI, In-Memory technology and fancy graphics. Tableau, QlikView and Microsoft PowerBi are showing off the eye-candy, and managers like what they see. However, either these solutions cost a lot of money, or your organization is stuck on older versions of software that lacks the functionality needed.
This session will show you how to make a cool dashboard using a database (MS SQL Server 2008), Excel 2010, and in addition how to prepare your solution for SQL2012 and the full PowerBI-suite with PowerPivot

## Abstract:
### You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.

## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: DAX from the field: Real World Case Studies
## Abstract:
### DAX is still relatively new for many BI practitioners, but it has being used for more than 4 years now, also in large installations that push the xVelocity in memory engine to its limit. In this session, we will share some of the lessons learned from the field, where real customers have problems harder to solve than Adventure Works scenarios. How do you make a database fit in memory, if it does not fit? How do you handle billions of rows with complex calculation? Can you perform reporting in any time zone, with time intelligence, in an efficient way? What tools do you use to benchmark and choose the right hardware? How do you scale up performance on small and large databases? What are the common mistakes in DAX formulas that might cause performance bottlenecks? These are just a few examples of the problems that you will see in this session. You will learn the solutions found and how far you can push the limits of the system.

## Speaker: Neil Hambly
## Title: Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy
## Abstract:
### We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. 
When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: Private Cloud for DBAs
## Abstract:
### It's probably rare that you have to install a SQL Server instance manually. You most likely have some unattended install scripts ready and perhaps even a script, using powershell, which configures the newly installed SQL Server according to your (corporate) standards.

But "at home" developers can click a few buttons in Windows Azure and have a SQL Server available within minutes. They are starting to be less impressed with your one-day process. In this session I'll walk you through the steps that you can take to create your own private cloud. Including rolling out sysprepped SQL Server vm's, giving your internal customers self-service capabilities but without losing control over your (corporate) standards. Did you know that you can even get a user interface for your internal customers which looks exacly like the Windows Azure interface?
