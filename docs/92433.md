## Title: Practical Container Scenarios in Azure
## Abstract:
### You’ve heard the buzz about containers and Kubernetes, now let’s start your journey towards rapidly deploying and scaling your container-based applications in Azure. In this session, we will introduce containers and the container orchestrator Kubernetes. Then we’ll dive into how to build a container image, push it into our Azure Container Registry and deploy it our Azure Kubernetes Services cluster. Once deployed, we’ll learn how to keep our applications available and how to scale them using Kubernetes.

Key topics introduced
Publishing containers to Azure Container Registry
Deploying Azure Kubernetes Services Clusters
Scaling our container-based applications in Azure Kubernetes Services
