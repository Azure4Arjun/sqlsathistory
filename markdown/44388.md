## Title: PowerBI  Other Self Service BI tools: Where They Fit in the Enterprise.
## Abstract:
### Self-service BI tools such as Power BI and Tableau provide business users the ability to use their data when they need it â€“ without relying heavily on IT.  Self-service BI tools speed up analysis, take strain off of IT for BI requests, and allow businesses to truly be more data driven.  Power BI or Tableau alone usually won't be complete BI solutions; they're designed to be pieces of a larger enterprise puzzle.  In this session Ross Parks, will talk about where Power BI stands in the market of self-service BI tools and how it can be utilized within an enterprise.  He will also demonstrate multiple implementation strategies for companies considering a self-service BI tool. Ross Parks has worked with several companies across with Wisconsin to implement self-service BI tools and will discuss his experiences as use-case examples.
