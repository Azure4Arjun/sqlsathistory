## Speaker: MIKE DONNELLY
## Title: Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101
## Abstract:
### Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.

## Speaker: Mark Vaillancourt
## Title: Keeping the "Business" in Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### It is no accident the term “Business Intelligence” starts with “Business.” Any Business Intelligence initiative should, likewise, start with the needs of the Business. For many years, BI was seen as a technology project. This is one reason why so many BI initiatives fail. Rather than a Technology Project, BI is a Business Program. It must grow and evolve as the Business grows an evolves. 

In this session, we will discuss the following:
-- Why BI is a worthwhile investment (using case study examples)
-- What criteria to use in determining the success of a BI initiative
-- Several reasons why BI initiatives fail
-- Critical Success Factors for BI

So much of the success for BI happens before the requirements are even gathered. Come learn how you can set yourself up for success with Business Intelligence.

## Title: Protecting Your Data with Encryption
## Abstract:
### We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.

## Speaker: John Pertell
## Title: Getting Top Performance from SQL Reporting Service
## Abstract:
### You’re a DBA at your company, and you’re in charge of keeping the production SQL servers humming. You know how to maintain and troubleshoot those instances for top performance. But now your boss has given you a new task: find out why the company reports are running so slowly and why the server itself seems unresponsive at times.

In this session we’ll talk about how to get the best performance from your SQL reporting server. We will discuss how to administer a SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) instance; how to install and configure the service for best performance, how to see what reports are currently running, and find which reports are bogging down the server. 

This session will not cover report design scaling out, or SSRS for SharePoint.

# Pseudo-Constants in SQL

Event Date: 11-04-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Track 8
## Speaker: Riley Major
## Title: Pseudo-Constants in SQL
## Abstract:
### You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.
