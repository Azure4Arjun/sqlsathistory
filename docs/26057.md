## Title: Dimensional Data Modeling Primer
## Abstract:
### Are you curious about Facts, Dimensions, and type 2 slowly changing dimensions that those Data Warehouse people talk about? This session will provide an introduction to the different architectures proposed by the two Data Warehouse proponents, Bill Inmon and Ralph Kimball.  We will present the theory and key concepts of Dimensional modeling and review why Dimensional modeling is important and the functionality a Data Warehouse can deliver that a normalized database cannot. We will also present some more advanced topics like heriarchies, snowflakes, recursive relationships, and bridge tables.
