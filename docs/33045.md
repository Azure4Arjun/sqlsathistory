## Title: Free SQL tools for your toolbox
## Abstract:
###   Every SQL developer or DBA should have a fully stocked toolbox that they can turn to in times of need.  SQL Server enjoys a wide variety of support from 3rd party vendors that provide tools to help us peek under the hood and pinpoint issues.  Sometimes we either don't have the budget for everything we would like, or we need something for a one-off project.  In this session we will examine some of the free tools published by members of the SQL community and 3rd party vendors.
