## Title: Visualizing Data with Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Data is beautiful…or at least it can be….This session dives into the art  science behind data visualization. We will start by looking at the research done by Stephen Few and Edward Tufte to practically understand questions such as why you should prefer a bar chart over a line chart and why you typically should avoid pie charts whenever possible. Next, we will look at why Reporting Services is a rich  powerful platform for delivering your visualization before wrapping-up with techniques for implementing and delivering your eye-popping data visualizations.
