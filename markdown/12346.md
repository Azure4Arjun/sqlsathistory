## Title: Understanding SSIS Performance
## Abstract:
### Many casual users of SSIS (including database professionals using the SSMS Import/Export Wizard) don't necessarily understand the inner workings of SSIS and what factors impact performance.  During this session, we'll look at different aspects of SSIS and discuss their impact on package performance.  We'll take a deep dive into the Data Flow component, looking at how SSIS manages data as it moves from sources, through transformations, and then to destinations.  Finally, we'll talk about several of the top performance killers casual SSIS users experience and discuss strategies for overcoming these common issues.
