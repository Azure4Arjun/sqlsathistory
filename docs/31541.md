## Title: Find and tune those queries!
## Abstract:
### There are queries that we usually play a mouse and cat game with, while trying to catch them! When the query is performing badly every time it executes, it is easy to find and tune it. But it could be difficult to isolate those that have inconsistent execution behavior. What is the problem with them, do we need to re-write, to plan guide or to create yet another index? Well, you need to find them first. In this session you will learn how to find and tune queries with inconsistent execution behavior and how to tune them. Getting a predictable query response time is one of the main goals of performance tuning and optimization and this session will definitely help you achieve that goal.
