## Title: Power BI:  Data Refresh ad SSAS On-Premises Connectivity
## Abstract:
### Join me to go under the hood with a Power BI deep dive. Where I will discuss two Hybrid Scenarios for Power BI.  I will explore the data refresh capabilities, allowing reports published to Power BI to connect to varying data sources for data refresh. I will also discuss exciting new capabilities that allows Power BI to connect directly to SQL Server Analysis Services on-premises and interactively query.  Allowing customers to keep and manage data on-premises without the need to move their data to the cloud.
