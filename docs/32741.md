## Title: Mirroring: The Bare Necessities
## Abstract:
### Remember Baloo the bear from the Jungle Book? Well we are going to get down to the "bear" necessities of mirroring and more. Mirroring can be an integral part of your high availability and disaster recovery planning. Weâ€™ll cover what mirroring is, how it can fit into an HA/DR plan, the rules surrounding its use, configuration via the GUI and T-SQL, as well as how to monitor mirroring. This presentation is designed to not only give you an overview of mirroring, but to also walk you through a basic implementation. At the end you will have learned what mirroring is, how it can fit into your environment, what business requirements it solves, and how to configure it.
