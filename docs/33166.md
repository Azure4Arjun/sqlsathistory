## Title: Data Mining.. Making $mart financial decisions
## Abstract:
### Over the past few months many financial houses have been severely ‘hit’ by the current slump in the sub prime mortgage market. This has lead to severe losses and considerable client liability. Many firms are now starting to take a ‘serious look’ at the potential utilization of data mining techniques as part of their ongoing efforts to control their risk exposure. This beginner to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at showing the attendee some of the ‘data mining’ prototypes solutions that we are currently developing with SQL Server 2005 / 2008, as a part of our ongoing efforts to manage our risk.
