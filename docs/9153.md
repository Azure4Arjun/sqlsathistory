## Title: Policy-Based Management and Central Management Server 
## Abstract:
### Two of the most highly underutilized features of SQL Server are Policy-Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS). PBM allows you to administer and control your SQL Server environment in a way that was very difficult or even impossible beforehand.  Simply put PBM lets you define rules or policies to govern your SQL Server enterprise. CMS among other things allows you to organize and manage your instances in groups that you define from a single point. Come see how these two features can add a whole new level of manageability and reduce the time you spend achieving your management goals.
