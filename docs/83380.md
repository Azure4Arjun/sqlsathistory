## Title: HA/DR Solutions Using Distributed Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### When designing your HA/DR solution, you need to consider all the possible options SQL Server has to offer to implement what is right for you.  You will see how to use Failover Cluster Instances, Standalone Instances, Clusters, Availability Groups and Distributed Availability Groups.

We will walk through how to set up and configure an HA/DR solution from beginning to end, review possible alerts, and how to monitor.  We will take a look at the new SQL2017 Read-scale Availability Groups and why to use them.  We will architect one of many possible VM solutions to host your HA/DR implementation.

Finally, we will see Automatic Failover and see how to perform a Manual Failover.
