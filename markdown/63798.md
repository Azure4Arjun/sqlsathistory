## Title: In a Perfect World, Azure is Greenâ€¦ Green as in, all is well
## Abstract:
### This session will present the fundamentals needed to setup monitoring and alerting for a global Azure PaaS application to insure the application is available to your customers and is performing correctly.

I'll review the Azure Portal navigation fundamentals in order to demonstrate how to monitor uptime and application performance for a globally deployed Azure PaaS application currently in use by major companies like ATT, Bell, and Vodaphone.
Coverage will included how to monitor and alert on individual components in the Azure Portal, setting up alerts in Application Insights and configuring shared dashboards so that a production support team on a Follow-The-Sun schedule can effectively monitor the application.
