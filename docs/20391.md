## Title: Tablix - The Rubik Cube of Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Did you know that the Table, Matrix, and List controls are all based on the highly flexible Tablix Data Region Grid? So really, they are all one control that can be morphed into each other. 

Learn how to get the most out of the Tablix controls in this demo-heavy session. We'll go through how to best layout data using multiple Tablix controls. We’ll use parameters to change the layout of the data in these controls to minimize the number of reports that need to be maintained. We’ll create a columnar report that grows vertically as well as horizontally, and we’ll find out about other exciting uses of this highly flexible control.
