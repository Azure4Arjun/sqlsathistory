## Title: Implementing auditing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The ability to audit in SQL server has been available for quite some time using different tools and techniques. This session will outline several methods to implement audtiting, but will focus primarily on SQL Audit. SQL Audit provides the ability to track and log activities and changes at the instance or database level built upon Extended Events SQL Audit provides both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. The granularity of events that can be monitored and tracked with SQL Audit can only be matched by means of using a SQL Profiler trace, but provides reduced overhead. This presentation will provide insight into the internals of SQL Audit, along with how to plan, create, and monitor instance and database level audits.
