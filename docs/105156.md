## Title: Database DevOps with Containers
## Abstract:
### Unlike CI/CD pipelines for applications, we can't just delete the database and pop up a new one with each new version. Let's start with the production database, and get SQL Server content to developers in containers, and then flow schema and lookup data back into production with migration tools. You can bring the reliability and automation of CI/CD pipelines to Database DevOps with containers.
