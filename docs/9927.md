## Title: SSIS Configurations Vs. Parameters
## Abstract:
### In this session, we review configurations in SQL 2008R2 and 2012. The 2008R2 options allowed dynamic configuration across environments. SSIS 2012 adds new dynamic options, including Parameters, Expressions and Variables. This upgrade takes SSIS from simply confusing to downright confounding. We will simplify these options so anyone with basic SSIS experience can follow along.
