## Title: Back to Basics - The SELECT Statement
## Abstract:
### If you are going to do anything with data you are going to need to learn how to query data. And the language to query the majority of those systems is through SQL (Structured Query Language). The pull data from any systems you are going to be relying on the Select statement. The features in the statement may vary slightly from platform to platform, but the core capabilities are the same.

In this session, we will dive deep in to the SELECT statement as the window to getting your data. In this session, we will be using one platform, but the lessons learned here will be applicable to querying any system that supports a SQL language interface. This session will cover things like querying, joins, functions, aggregation, sub queries, and much more. This session will give you the foundation to start analyzing data in any database system.
