## Title: Achieving Infinite Scale with HDInsight
## Abstract:
### The traditional approach to database scalability has been to simply buy a bigger box. However with the ongoing data explosion that is occurring in organisations today there is a need to re-think how to achieve scalability for the database platform. In this session we will explore how to extend the scalability of Microsoft SQL Server by using HDInsight and how to achieve scalability as a Hybrid solution using the Azure platform. With nothing more than a credit card and the Azure platform you will see how it is now possible to create highly-available, infinitely scalable SQL Server environments that support automated deployment and elastic scale.
