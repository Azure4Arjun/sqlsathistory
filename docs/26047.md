## Title: Breaking Data - How to Load and Stress test your database using SQL Profiler and OStress
## Abstract:
### This session will present how you can load and stress test your SQL Server database using SQL Profiler and OStress. This session will review how to performance test Extract, Transform, and Load SSIS processes, application SQL code, Reports, and free-roaming SQL. We will share SQL Profiler templates that help to trap the poorly performing SQL statements that can then be using to stress test your database until it breaks. In addition, we will show how SQL Profiler can be used to extract the SQL submitted by SSIS and Object-Relational Modeling tools like Hibernate and then use that SQL to take stress testing to the next level.

The first third of the presentation will be presentation style and the following two thirds will be demonstrations where we try and break the database with our stress testing. All this with a Breaking Bad theme!
