## Title: Designing Stored Procedure Solutions
## Abstract:
### With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.
