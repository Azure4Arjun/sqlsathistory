## Title: Rock Your Session - Best Practices for Presentations
## Abstract:
### Just because you’re a technical rock star doesn’t mean your technical presentation is going to rock. And even if you own the room for technical presentations, you may find that your business presentations often fall short. This session is for veteran presenters as well as first-timers, offering prescriptive guidance and best practices for structuring, building, and delivering a compelling presentation every time—whether technical or non-technical. Effective and persuasive presentation skills are critical for survival and success in the workplace—this is a session worth checking out.
