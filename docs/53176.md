## Title: Tintri: I/O Whack-a-Mole
## Abstract:
### Grab your lunch and join Christopher Slater  Dylan Thieu of Tintri in the Tintri room for an informative presentation while you eat!

Disk I/O for a virtualized SQL Server database takes a mysterious journey. In this session we will take the mystery out of virtual disk I/O. Using common infrastructure tools we will explore the path of a disk I/O and share repeatable methods that can be used to quickly identify the cause of a performance bottleneck. Along the way we will explore SQL Server, the Virtual Machine, the hypervisor, virtual switches, physical switches, and the storage.
