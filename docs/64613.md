## Title: Database code management with VS 2017 and RedGate
## Abstract:
### When doing agile development, whether you have 1 production target database or in case of a SaaS solution, multiple targets, database change management becomes extremely crucial. One of the challenges with traditional SSDT projects are that they work on the "as-is" model through the development cycle and obfuscate the details of how actual changes would be applied. In this session, we will look at how to use the RedGate tools now available inside Visual Studio 2017 to manage the development process and gain better control over your deployments. 

This session will cover my experiences, tips and tricks with managing a Cloud SaaS solution and we will look at how Visual Studio 2017 and the RedGate family of tools provide tremendous value and higher confidence with our product releases.
