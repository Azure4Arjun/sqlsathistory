# Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#548---Kansas-City-2016)
Event Date: 24-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check
## Abstract:
### How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  Many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have quite a few gaping holes. It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, servers with constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that even have too much!) 

Come learn how to use freely available tools from multiple layers of the SQL Server stack to check your servers for basic issues like missing backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy problems and improper indexing. If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Speaker: Frank Kearney
## Title: Near real time analytics with Azure Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### As recently as 5 years ago, most companies could not afford the technology or did not possess the in-house skill sets needed to implement real-time analytics. At least not without involving a lot of money, a large development team and some duct tape. However, in the last few years, Microsoft has made this type of technology available at an affordable cost (and without the need of large dev team or duct tape) in the form of Azure Stream Analytics. 
In this session we will review the architecture of Azure Stream Analytics, a walk through to implement this technology and a live demo with audience participation using PowerBI and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

# Data Migration Using BIML
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#548---Kansas-City-2016)
Event Date: 24-09-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Biml
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Data Migration Using BIML
## Abstract:
### Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.

## Speaker: Chase Aucoin
## Title: Microdata For Microservices
## Abstract:
### Applications continue to get more complicated and distributed as inexpensive hardware becomes more and more ubiquitous. Currently the trend is to lead more towards a microservice paradigm when ti comes to large scale application development.

## Speaker: Jeremy Marx
## Title: Introduction to BIML and BimlScript
## Abstract:
### You have a lot of data to move and a lot of pieces to manage. Perhaps you're a developer and know that SSIS is the best way to move it, but you naturally dislike GUI-based development or you're just not looking forward to the tedium.

Or perhaps you're a team lead/architect and are looking for an efficient platform that best utilizes the development skills of your team.

Jeremy Marx will introduce BIML, a language you can quickly pick up to develop SSIS solutions with code, and BIMLscript, intelligently mixing in C# to make your BIML practically build itself.

Jeremy will demonstrate how to build a simple, single-table SSIS package using BIML, then extend it to many tables with just a few lines of code, and finally apply a more robust data flow designed for reuse. You'll leave with tools and resources to begin coding SSIS solutions faster and more efficiently.

## Speaker: Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Kerberos Delegation Made Simple
## Abstract:
### Kerberos delegation is often needed for SQL Server Reporting Services security. Many DBAs avoid Kerberos because of the complexity and come up with workarounds that may violate security policies in their shops. They also may not understand why Kerberos delegation is even required. 
Configuring Kerberos for SSRS can be broken down into three simple steps: SPN registration, setting delegation properties, and application configuration. It’s really not so difficult, and there are a number of tools that can help you troubleshoot when things don’t go as planned.
Attend this session to learn why Kerberos is necessary and how to configure and troubleshoot it.

### The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood, components of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long start-up times, problems with the transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log works and what information is actually stored in the log. You'll learn how to optimize the log's performance, determining the right settings for log growth, and what to do when things get out of control.

## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
## Abstract:
### You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml
## Abstract:
### Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.

## Title: Troubleshooting Skills for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Watching someone who is good at troubleshooting complex issues is like watching a magician perform on stage. It looks easy but unless you have the skills and know the trick, it can be black magic to you. Many DBAs and technology professionals can easily look in Books Online to find an answer to a technical question or how a SQL Server feature works. But where do you look on how you would become a better DBA at troubleshooting issues? How do you do you identify the root cause of the issue? This session will cover different approaches and skills to be a more efficient problem solver which is critical when your production system is down and time is money. The session will also cover how to create and present the root cause analysis so your team can learn from the mistakes and fix the issue.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

# A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#548---Kansas-City-2016)

## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.
