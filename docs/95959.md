## Speaker: Dan King
## Title: PowerBI and PowerApps Married at First Sight
## Abstract:
### PowerBI is Microsoft's self service reporting tool that give businesses a robust visualization of their data. As Microsoft's Power Platform has evolved, PowerApps is taking a similar approach by providing businesses with a self service application tier. In this session we will see the power of bringing the two together. Let's explore how the visualization tier of PowerBI can enhance the development and capabilities of PowerApps.  We will go from a blank canvas app and import visualizations while pointing out some of the pros and cons of marrying the two together. We will use the capabilities of PowerApps to write and update our SQL Server tables. Bringing the two together can provide businesses with a robust solution under one umbrella. Join me in learning how these two services came together and said "I DO".
