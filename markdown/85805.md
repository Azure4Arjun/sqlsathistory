## Title: The role of the DBA in Compliant Database DevOps
## Abstract:
### Organizations are under increasing pressure to deliver high quality software and services fast. But for Operations teams, the ability to support frequent change can be constrained by the complexities of database environments, and a need to protect the stability of the live environment and the security of the data it contains.

In this session, we’ll demonstrate the tools you can use to protect sensitive data as it moves through environments, while helping your organization embrace a DevOps approach to software delivery.

 You will learn how to:

Provision realistic isolated environments quickly and without the storage concerns
Anonymize or replace sensitive data for reliable and compliant development
Measure the performance impact of changes as they’re introduced
Gain an understanding of the state of databases that are being deployed against
