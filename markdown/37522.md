## Title: NoSQL - MongoDB. Agility, scalability, performance (Part 2)
## Abstract:
### NoSQL - MongoDB. Agility, scalability, performance. I am going to talk about the basis of NoSQL and MongoDB. Why some projects requires RDBMs and another NoSQL databases? What are the pros and cons to use NoSQL vs. SQL? How data are stored and transefed in MongoDB? What query language is used? How MongoDB supports high availability and automatic failover with the help of the replication? What is sharding and how it helps to support scalability?. The newest level of the concurrency - collection-level and document-level. Join the session, I promise that it will be interesting! :)
