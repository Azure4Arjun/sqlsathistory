## Title: Keynote: Data Culture : From BI  Analytics to Big Data and Data Science
## Abstract:
### In this mobile-first, cloud-first era – data is at the intersection – with apps, devices and sensors creating tremendous volumes of data.  To get value out of that data, we must be able to reason over it,  tap into processing power to quickly analyze it and accelerate the insights,  which ultimately lead to better decisions, actions and business results. Companies that put data at the heart of their business operations outperform those that don’t by a significant margin, which we call releasing the ‘Data Dividend’.  We will take a walk through the key technologies from PowerBI to AzureML and IoT to show how to start driving your Data Culture.
