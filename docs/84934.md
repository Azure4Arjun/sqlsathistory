## Title: Graphs in SQL Server and Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### One of the new features in SQL Server 2017 was Graph tables. These represent a different way of storing data to what we’re use to in the relational model.

In this session, I’ll take you through the design process for graph tables, and then implement and query some graphs in both SQL Server 2017 and Cosmos DB using its graph model.
