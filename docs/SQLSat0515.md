## Speaker: Ken Clement
## Title: SQL Anti-Patterns and when it's Okay to be Bad
## Abstract:
### Did I really do that?  If you didn't, you probably will.  And even if you don't ever, it's a good bet that you will still have to deal with others' legacies of Anti-Patterns.  Decades of practice by thousands of software and database developers around the world have produced a large corpus of recognized best practices,  Anti-Patterns are the antithesis of best practice - they are recognized as approaches to be avoided.  SQL databases including SQL Server are no exception.  A number of SQL Anti-Patterns will be described here, along with better practices and exceptions where the Anti-Pattern may actually be a good answer.   This presentation ought to be a spectator's delight - a chance to slow down and admire the train wrecks of others.  For nothing is as instructive as mistakes or as fun to dissect.

## Abstract:
### Do you dream about starting a business? You’re not alone—millions of Americans share that dream. And yet, not everyone has the courage to get started. But if you’re reading this, you have already taken the first steps toward turning your dream into reality.

Obviously, dreaming alone isn’t enough. You have to do your homework, create a plan and take action. You will have good days and bad ones. But don’t get discouraged. As Walt Disney said, “If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember this whole thing was started by a dream and a mouse.” 

Simple Steps for Starting Your Business is more than just a guide to business ownership. It’s really a blueprint for helping make your dreams a reality.

In this session Bob Breaux from the Baton Rouge SCORE chapter will introduce you to the foundations of starting your own business and give you insight into the resources that are available to you within the state of Louisiana to do so!

# Testing SSIS Packages
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-515)
Event Date: 06-08-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error

# Effective Software Application Logging

## Speaker: Jason Rowlen
## Title: Effective Software Application Logging
## Abstract:
### This session presents an overview of effective methods and strategies for capturing and managing useful information about how your software applications are running, what they are doing (which may or may not be what they are expected to be doing), and most importantly, when, where, and sometimes even why, they are malfunctioning. Software application logging is an often neglected, poorly implemented, and under-appreciated aspect of the software development process. But if implemented wisely, logging can be an invaluable tool for debugging, testing, error handling, and auditing. This session will present a case for a more diligent and rewarding approach to logging, and provide useful tips that can cost very little extra development time, but pay off in the long run, most especially when production issues arise and must be resolved quickly.

### Becoming a proactive DBA is something that most SQL administrators strive to be but many fall short.  Meetings, doing non-SQL related tasks, excessive workload and sometimes corporate culture often work against a DBA by creating conditions where it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the tasks involved in taking care of your SQL instances.  Our presentation will cover those proactive tasks and alerts that will provide a straightforward method of ensuring that maintenance and monitoring are working for all SQL instances you are responsible for.  Additionally, we will cover some ways to identify emergency performance problems that will allow a DBA to quickly resolve issues while making them look like the expert they truly are.

## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

# Rx for Demystifying Index Tuning Decisions
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-515)
Event Date: 06-08-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: SQL Server Administration
## Speaker: Jeffry Schwartz
## Title: Rx for Demystifying Index Tuning Decisions
## Abstract:
### Indexes are one of the most troubling and mysterious areas for DBAs and developers.  Adding, deleting, or modifying them can yield dramatically positive or negative changes in query performance.  The mystery is knowing how indexes need to be adjusted and what outcomes will result.  This uncertainty often leads to great reluctance to eliminate indexes that are used sparingly or only because the optimal ones are missing.  This leads to index proliferation, which ultimately produces inconsistent and poor query performance.  Some believe that the SQL Server Database Tuning Advisor will solve all these issues, but it frequently does not.  In fact, it often compounds the proliferation problem significantly.  This presentation will enable a DBA to make informed decisions regarding what query and index metrics to monitor, determine how indexes are used, and devise appropriate index strategies to improve query performance through index addition, deletion, or modification.
