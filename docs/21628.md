## Title: The Quest for the Golden Record: MDM Best Practices
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will focus on how to formulate a Master Data Management (MDM) strategy and build a solution to find the 
single version of the truth, aka the Golden Record. While these techniques can apply to any domain, we will demonstrate building a sample customer domain in this session, showing how to leverage SQL Server Master Data Services(MDS) and other tools for data quality, matching, and de-duplication across multiple data sources.
