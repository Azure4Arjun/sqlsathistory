## Speaker: Jeff Abbott
## Title: Be the SQL Server Dev/Ops Hero, brought to you by Actifio
## Abstract:
### As the value of Dev/Ops becomes more apparent to IT organizations, increasing demand is placed on the SQL Server DBA to manage a more agile and resilient database environment.  A Dev/Ops model requires management of dozens of copies of each database across many servers, The need to provision and refresh these copies quickly is key to the success of any Agile development effort.  In this session we will discuss the SQL Server DBA's role within Dev/Ops - we'll talk a bit about things like Sprints, Chef and Puppet, but most importantly we will discuss how you can present a database to any host in your environment in a couple of minutes regardless of size.  Come see a copy of a 1.6TB SQL Server database presented to a host (same host or different doesn't matter) in less than 2 minutes - try doing that from a database restore!
