## Title: SSAS Tabular and Self Service BI - TheDynamDAX Duo
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover how SSAS tabular and Self Service BI compliment each other and make the slicing and dicing of large amounts of data a breeze for Power Users. I will give a brief explanation and history of each then will walk through how to create a SSAS tabular model, get into how to create data relationships from a regular database model with large tables, then hook it up to Excel and expose the elements for users to slice and dice data with ease and create charts. Then will demonstrate a few DAX commands that are very powerful yet very easy.
