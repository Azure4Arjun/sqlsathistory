## Abstract:
### During this session we will talk about DevOps practices in general and also see some demos about how to automate your builds, how to manage your releases, how to manage different environments and create them on a fly.

I will show the demo app which consists of 3 parts - client app, server api and database. I will show how to automate builds for all parts of your project. I will show how to provide different configuration settings for different environments. I will show how you can create new environment on a fly, deploy your app there, run some integration and UI automation tests, etc. I will show how to automate all routine stuff and focused more on innovation, not maintenance.
