## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: The Secret Life of APPLY: Helping Developers Work Smarter, Not Harder
## Abstract:
### At the very least, a T-SQL developer should know that the APPLY operator lets you access data from a table-valued function in a dynamic manner.  But why stop there? When getting the data you need requires going around your elbow to get to your nose, that's when the savvy developer remembers the APPLY operator can be used with any table expression. Have you ever wished you could get multiple columns or multiple rows from a correlated sub-query? What about needing to UNPIVOT a data set, or parse some XML code? Have you simply wanted to find a way to handle complex calculations without having to cut and paste the entire formula in the WHERE or GROUP BY clause? This all-demo session answers those needs by revealing the secret life of APPLY, and helping you count yourself among those ace developers that use this handy operator to work smarter, not harder.

## Speaker: Tobias Koprowski
## Title: SQL Azure from Plan, to Backup, to Cloud 
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released SQL Azure more than two years ago - that's enough time for testing (I hope!). So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually, restoring with Red Gate Cloud Services. In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionality, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

## Speaker: Matt Masson
## Title: Cats, Facebook, and Online Dating with Microsoft BI
## Abstract:
### The BI Power Hour is a popular session at the PASS Summit and TechEd conferences that shows off the power and versatility of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack through demos that contain little to no real world business value. Unlike most technical sessions at these conferences, the goal of the Power Hour is to entertain rather than educate. Any learning the audience experiences is purely accidental. For the past three years I’ve been a Power Hour presenter and have put together a number of demos that use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in non-standard ways. This session will take a look at these demos, show how they were built, and talk about some of the key things I’ve learned while putting them together.

## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy
## Abstract:
### Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.
