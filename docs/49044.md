## Title: Peanut Butter  Chocolate:  Integrating Hadoop with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### So you jumped on the bandwagon and set up a Hadoop clusterâ€¦but now what?  Your database developers and app developers know how to integrate with and develop against SQL Server, but the Hadoop world is a completely different experience.  This talk will help bridge the gap between SQL Server and Hadoop, using tools such as SQL Server Integration Services and Sqoop to migrate data between a Hadoop cluster and a SQL Server instance, as well as PolyBase to integrate the two like never before.
