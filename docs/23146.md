### So... you've created a bunch of indexes to improve the performance of your application, but then you start to notice performance degradation overtime. Digging further, you find that your indexes are not being maintained. In this session we'll look at some different systems that can be used for index maintenance. Additionally we'll explore some of the basic DMV's that provide us information about indexes.
