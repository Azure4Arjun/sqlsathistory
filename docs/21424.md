## Title: WHAT HA/DR OPTION(S) ARE RIGHT FOR YOU
## Abstract:
### Your manager comes to you and asks you to setup your production SQL Server environment so that you have a level of High Availability plus you need to design and implement a Disaster Recovery strategy.
It may sound like an exam question, but itâ€™s something that a DBA gets asked frequently.
Do you understand the relative strengths of the various HA/DR technologies, such as Availability Groups, Failover Cluster Instances, Mirroring, Log Shipping and Replication?
In this talk we will cover the various options, what the strengths and weaknesses are for each, and help you to go back to your manager with a plan.
