## Title: Hiding Data from Prying Eyes:  Using SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### Past versions of SQL Server didn't include many options for encrypting data outside of network traffic and at rest.  This is going to change with SQL Server 2016, which has a new feature named "Always Encrypted".  This talk will show the fundamentals of using this technology and a demo of how to configure it and work with the encrypted data.
