## Speaker: Andrew Loree
## Title: Getting started with Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Do you have large amounts of data which you want to leverage to predict the answers to difficult questions?  The seemingly new field of Machine Learning (ML) has been around for almost 60 years, with this exact goal in mind. 

In this session, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of ML, to get you started without requiring a mathematics background.  We will look at how to “frame” your data questions, as well as understanding the type of outputs ML can provide in responding with predictions.   Focus will be placed on the high-level overview of the ML process, and spend time on the simple steps of determining the “right” algorithm to use.  Tools used include Weka and Azure ML Studio, but the focus of the session is on fundamentals and the ML process, not specific toolsets.
