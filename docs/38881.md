## Title: Diving Into Query Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### There is no better way to understand how TSQL is executing than through the execution plan.  We will go into detail about the more complex parts of execution plans, relating them to other query statistics, and use this information to improve overall query performance.  Be sure to bring your safety helmet!
