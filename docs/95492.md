Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Janice Gerbrandt
## Title: Automate tests in your database with tSQLt
## Abstract:
### tSQLt is an easy-to-use database unit testing framework for Microsoft SQL Server. It is ideal for the database developer because tests are written in T-SQL.

This session explores how and why application unit testing is performed, and then focuses on unit testing database code with tSQLt.  We will learn how tests are structured, and how to set up realistic tests. We will talk about how much testing coverage is enough and when you can stop.

Even if you aren't able to fully implement Test Driven Development tomorrow, you'll walk away knowing how to future-protect that next tricky bit of logic with tests that will ensure your code produces desired results, not only the first time, but with all future modifications as well.
