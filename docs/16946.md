## Abstract:
### The Business Intelligence adoption over the last few years has grown dramatically to the point where organizations require business insights, not only from what has already happened (typical data warehousing), but from real-time performance and how will the future be, based on the business and market trends. In this session we will explore and demonstrate the main decision-making capabilities in SQL Server 2012 using Analysis Services, Data Mining and the power behind PowerPivot and PowerView hosted within Excel.
