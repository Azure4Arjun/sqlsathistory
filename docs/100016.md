## Title: Machine Learning with AzureML and Microsoft Excel API
## Abstract:
### How cool would it be, if it is possible to run a Machine Learning model in AzureML to classify or predict your business requirement and give access of it to your employees to run it every time using their most favorite tool... yes Microsoft Excel

Also, would it excite you, if you were told, the entire time to build and deploy this ML App with AzureML and Microsoft Excel is a matter of hours, with no mobile app, no website, no servers... just set, ready to go.

Join me in this exploratory session on building and deploying Machine Learning model for your business with AzureML with Microsoft Excel API.
