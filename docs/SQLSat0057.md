# Bad SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#57---Houston-2011)
Event Date: 29-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Geoff Hiten
## Title: Bad SQL
## Abstract:
### How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.

## Title: Execution Plan Basics
## Abstract:
### This will be a Beginner to Intermediate session highlighting the starting point for using the execution plans from SQL Server to assist in query tuning. Briefly, we will look at the history to get an idea of how Microsoft has improved the display through Graphical Plans and Missing Index suggestion. What is the difference between a Table and Clustered Index Scan? What is a Lookup? How do you improve performance of Lookups? What are the different types of Loops? How to get more information from the Plan with the properties window?

# Transition from DBA to BI Architect

## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Transition from DBA to BI Architect 
## Abstract:
### Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.

## Speaker: Trevor Barkhouse
## Title: A PowerShell Cookbook for DBAs
## Abstract:
### This introduction to PowerShell is different than most.  Instead of starting with a full treatment of the language, you will receive a brief overview then a collection of "recipes," stand-alone PowerShell scripts that automate various administration tasks for SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008/2008R2.  You will learn by example, and quickly realize why investing a little time into learning PowerShell will make your job a great deal easier.

## Speaker: Trevor Barkhouse
## Title: Deadlock Detection, Troubleshooting,  Prevention
## Abstract:
### As an enterprise application grows and load increases, some concurrency issues are bound to surface. Deadlocks are one of the more aggravating of this class of problems. Fortunately, each release of SQL Server includes better tools for troubleshooting deadlocks. Trevor will provide a strong foundation on deadlocks and then demonstrate approaches for handling them in SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008/2008R2.

# Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#57---Houston-2011)
Event Date: 29-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution
## Abstract:
### Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document.   In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”

# Getting Started with MDX

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
