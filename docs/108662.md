## Speaker: Mark Runyon
## Title: Getting Started as a Conference Speaker
## Abstract:
### Conference speaking is a very rewarding way to give back to the community. Just getting on stage is often the most challenging part. We dig into questions that people struggle with. 

How do you decide on a topic? 
How do you get past a phobia in public speaking? 
What if someone asks a question you don't know? 
How do you connect with your audience and get them to engage with you?

I'll teach you how to construct a successful talk and point out things you need to be aware of each step of the way. You will walk away with the tools to help you squash the butterflies and make your experience a success.
