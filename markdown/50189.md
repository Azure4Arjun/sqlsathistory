## Title: Scaling for best performance: Partitioned views.
## Abstract:
### Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition.  Even though that is correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. 

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to imitate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining both partitioned views and table partitioning as well as inMemory tables to give us an ability to use double partition elimination based on two different keys as well as the ability to move hot spots data into inMemory OLTP.
