## Title: Brick-by-Brick: Foundational Azure Databricks Concepts
## Abstract:
### As the business need for data becomes more prominent, the platform that IT builds on becomes a crucial component to the success of any data analytics project.  Apache Spark centralizes the information management process by providing a unified platform.  Azure Databricks takes that concept one step further by providing a layer of abstraction from Apache Spark, which allows for easier adoption of a big data ecosystem.  This presentation and demonstration will dive into the core concepts of Azure Databricks by focusing on three main use cases: ETL/ELT, Structured Streaming, and Machine Learning.
