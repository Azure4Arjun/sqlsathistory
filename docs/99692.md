## Title: Data Bricks, Spark, Machine Learning and Azure Synapse Analytics
## Abstract:
### You've heard about Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Warehouse, now called Azure Synapse Analytics.  You've also heard about Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Bricks.  You might even have heard about Python, Spark, and Azure Machine Learning.  In this fast-paced, all-demo session, we will walk through the process of ingesting data into the Data Lake, analyzing it with Spark and Machine Learning, outputting it to the Data Warehouse and reporting on it in Power BI.  You will walk away with working code and an overall understanding of how all these tools can help you develop advanced analytics solutions in the modern data landscape.
