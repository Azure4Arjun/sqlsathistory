## Title: Power BI, Information Management, and Data Stewardship
## Abstract:
### Power BI for Office 365 delivers a compelling set of Self-Service BI tools and services for the discovery, analysis, and visualization of on-premises and cloud-based data. Power BI represents a major delivery on the SQL Server organization’s “cloud first” vision, with functionality delivered in the Microsoft cloud before being available on-premises.
 In this session SQL Server Senior Program Manager Matthew Roche will introduce Power BI, with a focus on self-service information management (SSIM) and data stewardship. You’ll leave with a solid understanding of the capabilities of the Power BI platform, how it can empower business users and data experts within your organization, and how to get started right away.
