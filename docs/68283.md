## Title: Data Modeling and Design for New Features in SQL Server and Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### With the availability of new Graph Database features in SQL Server 2017 and the new Cosmos DB, Microsoft’s globally-distributed, multi-model database service for managing data at scale, database architects are expected to create and translate data models to non-relational physical database designs.  For decades, data modeling and database design has been focused on the relational model, yet we have all these new features to model for.

In this session, we’ll look at:
Why these features still need data modelsHow to prepare data models, logical and physical, for these target featuresHow these features change the data model/database design processHow tools support these new features (or don’t)How to approach tuning for these non-relational featuresFinally, we end with 10 tips for working with non-relational features while still maintaining data model-driven database design.
