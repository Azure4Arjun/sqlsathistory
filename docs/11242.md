## Title: Upgrading from SSIS Package Deployment to Project Deployment
## Abstract:
### Are you still using the package deployment model in your SSIS projects, but want to upgrade to the project deployment model? Are you unsure how to go from using package configurations, configuration files and the SSIS configurations table, to using parameters, environments and the SSISDB catalog?

In this session I will explain the differences between the package deployment model and the project deployment model, and show you step-by-step how you can upgrade your SSIS projects. You will learn how to configure the SSISDB catalog, set up environments and environment variables, work with parameters and monitor your projects.
