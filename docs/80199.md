## Title: SQL Server on Linux –  from 0 to 100 in 1 hour!
## Abstract:
### As you might know, SQL Server runs directly on Linux! Therefore, it was time for me to cross the bridge and install my first SQL Server on Linux so that I could play with on it. In the session we will start with simple things like installation but will quickly get yet deeper with DBA tasks.
