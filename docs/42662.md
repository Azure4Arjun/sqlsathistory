## Title: Indexing Strategy
## Abstract:
### Index for your entire server's performance instead of indexing for a single query, mostly by ensuring indexes are reusable by as many queries as reasonable.  Make the most of every index while limiting overhead of memory usage, I/O, disk, data modifications, and index maintenance.  Also look into tuning or rescheduling the queries that fall outside of typical data access patterns to keep index usage as efficient as possible.
