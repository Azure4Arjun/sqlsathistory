## Speaker: Nico Jacobs
## Title: Polybase in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### If you want to mix traditional relational data with semi-structured data stored on Azure or Hadoop, then the out-of-the-box Polybase functionality in SQL Server 2016 is one of the easiest ways to get started with this.

In this session we first introduce the Polybase architecture, then show how to setup and query Polybase. This demo-rich session helps both developers and DBAs in understanding the potential and practical use of Polybase.

# No more waiting – an introduction to SQL Server wait statistics

Event Date: 19-03-2016 - Session time: 14:40:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Enrico van de Laar
## Title: No more waiting – an introduction to SQL Server wait statistics
## Abstract:
### When you are standing in line at the grocery store you know exactly what you’re waiting for, paying the things you intend to buy. In SQL Server things aren’t usually so simple and many times you have to wait for more than only the length of the queue or the speed of the cashier. Thankfully SQL Server gathers the exact time you have been waiting and what resource you have been waiting on. In this session we will take a look at how SQL Server gathers this information and how it can help you identify, troubleshoot and proactively solve performance issues.

## Speaker: Peter ter Braake
## Title: DAX unraveled
## Abstract:
### DAX was created as an easier alternative for MDX with the introduction of PowerPivot. Multidimensional functionality with the look and feel of Excel functions and formulas. But the concept of context makes it more difficult than it might seem at a first glance. In this session we will learn to handle row-, query- and filter context by looking at a lot of practical examples.
