## Title: Minimal Processing for Large Cubes
## Abstract:
### Processing large cubes can consume vast amounts of IO, and create lengthy response times.  This presentation will demo how to process dimensions and dynamically create, process, and delete measure group partitions to minimize IO.  By taking control of cube processing through a SSIS package you are able to process only the bare minimum in order to bring a cube current while keeping response times acceptable.  Additional areas to cover will include the support tables to control cubes, and a review of the XMLA for creating, processing, and deleting.
