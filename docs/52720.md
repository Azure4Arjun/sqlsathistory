## Title: Winning with Columnstore - A Customer Story
## Abstract:
### This session will feature a real story of a customer who was running into performance and scaling issues on a big iron Oracle RAC system and why they decided to consider the magic of the Column Store for this situation.  Discussion will focus on the existing environments for testing both SQL 2016 and Oracle as well as the methodologies used for testing.  We will examine the decisions made for choosing indexes (both traditional and column store) for the main tables in the data warehouse as well as the partitioning strategies employed.  We will wrap up the discussion with the results of the testing and where they are now.
