## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring SQL Server on VMware
## Abstract:
### SQL Server on VMware???  Most of our customers have virtualized their application tier, but now are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. Some companies have tried to virtualize databases on VMware already but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools using standard Perfmon counters, you are getting misleading information. Understand which metrics are important and how to get the data.
