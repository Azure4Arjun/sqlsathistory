## Title: Consolidation and Virtualization: A Success Story
## Abstract:
### Consolidating SQL Server Instances can be daunting. Virtualizing SQL Server instances can be intimidating. Doing both at the same time can be absolutely frightening. 

When Mike Hillwig inherited his SQL environment, he had 14 SQL Server instances, running five different versions of SQL, all using local disk. In one project, his team consolidated this down to four servers. And the entire environment is virtual. In this session, MIke will share what they did, how they did it, what worked, and what didn't work so well.
