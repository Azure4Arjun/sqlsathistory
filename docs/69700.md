## Title: Power Query - The Best thing that ever happened in Excel
## Abstract:
### Excel so far had three "official" revolutions. One being the Pivot Table, second one Tables in Excel and the last one obviously Power Pivot. But Power Query (aka Get  Transform aka Data Explorer) trumps them all. This session will show you why this outrageous claim actually makes sense. This will be a full demo session that will prove the title right case by case and should also give you an understanding that if you do not use Power Query in Excel, you are not using Excel at all!
