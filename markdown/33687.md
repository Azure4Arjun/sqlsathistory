## Title: SQL Server Profiler and Tracing, a “How To”
## Abstract:
### We have all needed to know what is happening in our database systems.  We have often been tasked with finding poor performing queries.  Maybe we are being hit with Auditing and Compliance needs.  All these and many more issues can be resolved with SQL Server Profiler. Maybe with SQL Server Trace.  But which one, and when?
Auditing databases can be tiresome, but a good trace and supporting reports can really help out.
This presentation will show you some of my own ideas, along with others' ideas on best uses for Profiler and Trace.
Once armed with this knowledge, you should be able to take it back to your shops and implement systems that assist you track down these issues more easily.
