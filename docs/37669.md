## Title: Exploring Your SQL Server Databases with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### As a DBA and performance tuning consultant, for Ambient Consulting in Minneapolis, I'm often asked to analyze performance issues on a SQL Server instance with which I'm unfamiliar. It can be a daunting task. Let's face it, most of the time companies do not have good documentation about their databases. Or if they do, it is outdated, or it takes a few days to locate and retrieve it.

In this present, I share a set of basic scripts that I've developed, over the years, which mine the metadata in the various system functions, stored procedures, tables, catalog views, and dynamic management views, Together, they reveal all the secrets of the databases on the instance, their size, file locations, and their design, including columns, data types, defaults, keys and indexes.  You will walk away with 40 scripts to reverse engineer a database
