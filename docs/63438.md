## Title: Intro to MongoDB for SQL DBAs
## Abstract:
### MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scaling. It has become the leader in non-relational database for Fortune 500 companies and SQL DBAs are inheriting the responsibility to deploy and maintain this new technology with little outside help and training. This session will focus on educating SQL DBAs in the necessary skills needed to perform day to day tasks to keep your MongoDB healthy, available and fast.
This presentation will introduce MongoDB, provide a brief overview of the NOSQL platform, how to get started with MongoDb, patching MongoDB instances, intro to replica set, setting up backups  restore and if time allows a brief introduction to perform most of these operations through Ops Manager 3.4.
