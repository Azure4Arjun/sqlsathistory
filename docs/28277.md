## Title: Avoiding "Monkey At The Monitor" By Delegating
## Abstract:
### As a DBA there is a lot of simple, step-by-step work that has to be completed on a daily basis. And while it's obviously a necessary part of our job, it's not fun and it takes away from time we could spend doing more important, less urgent work. One attractive option is delegating work to others, thus allowing the DBA to focus on more attractive / important tasks. But how do we do so without compromising security or best practices? Using the tips and tricks presented in this session, you'll be able to spread your workload to junior personnel while still maintaining a sound security / audit model.
