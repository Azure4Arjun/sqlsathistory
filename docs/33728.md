## Speaker: Trevor Barkhouse
## Title: Deadlock Detection, Troubleshooting,  Prevention
## Abstract:
### As an enterprise application grows and load increases, some concurrency issues are bound to surface. Deadlocks are one of the more aggravating of this class of problems. Fortunately, each release of SQL Server includes better tools for troubleshooting deadlocks.  Trevor will provide a strong foundation on deadlocks and then demonstrate approaches for handling them in SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008.
