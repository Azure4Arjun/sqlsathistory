## Title: Harnessing Database Monitoring in a DevOps pipeline
## Abstract:
### Showing how a Database Monitoring tool can be used in conjunction with a DevOps process can help prevent shipping performance problems to production. In this session we will be showing how you can

Use data captured from Database Monitoring tool to validate performance testing

Use a Database Monitoring tool as an input to release gates, to only release when defined performance metrics have been met.

Use VSTS extensions to visualise performance test failures

This allows us to automatically fail releases based on poor performance as captured by a baseline in downstream environments, and surface that information in the release tool so that a release manager can understand why a release in the pipeline was marked as failed. This will typically be things like, high CPU, logical IO, missing indexes, or deadlocks.
