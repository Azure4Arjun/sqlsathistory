## Title: What to Do When SQL Server is Slow
## Abstract:
### Someone comes running in and asks, "Are you doing something on the SQL Server right now? Can you take a look at it? It seems really slow."

It's one of the most common complaints we get about our databases - and yet, most of us don't have a written plan with what steps to take, in order.

I do this for a living, so I've had to make a written checklist to handle it. I'll give you the exact same checklist I use, then walk you through several performance emergencies. I'll show you how I use open source scripts like sp_WhoIsActive, sp_BlitzFirst, sp_BlitzCache, and more to find the root cause fast. We won't cover performance tuning - our goal in this hour is just to have a written triage process so we don't look like bumbling idiots. Let's get good at this!
