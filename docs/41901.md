## Title: Using Power BI when Implementing Data Analytics Management Practices
## Abstract:
### Providing the tools to implement data analytics is only one part of a successful project.  Collaboration policies, data management roles, security, and training are all necessary to ensure the wide adoption of data based decision making throughout your organization. Business Analytics projects regularly require interaction with the technical teams who are responsible for ensuring the security, access and storage of the data. During this session we will discuss practices and methods learned to foster and continue good collaborative relationships between technical and analytics teams. The Power BI collaboration tools are used to illustrate the methods needed to encourage users to adopt data driven decision making in your organization.  Attendees will leave the session with a methodology which they can implement in their environments to promote successful data based decision making based on proven methods provided to a number of clients in a number of industries.
