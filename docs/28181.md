## Title: 20-Minute Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### The Tabular model is still the new kid on the block in the world of SQL Server Analysis Services, and its importance in the Microsoft BI roadmap continues to grow. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models promise considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a basic Tabular model.
