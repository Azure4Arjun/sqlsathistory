## Title: Analyzing Your Workload with Query Store
## Abstract:
### I've said it before and I'll say it again: Query Store is a game-changer for troubleshooting query performance. Yet when I ask people who are running SQL Server 2016 or higher if they're using Query Store, less than half say they are.  If you fall into that category, this session is for you.
We’ll start by discussing Query Store configuration. Sound a little boring? It won't be. There are multiple settings that affect how information is captured and you need to understand them. Next, we'll look at the data. Definitely not boring, as it's imperative you understand exactly what gets stored (and what doesn't) so you can find problematic queries quickly.  
Lastly, we'll mine the data in Query Store, and mining is more than just finding queries that use a particular index, or those that access a specific table. We’ll discuss different workload characteristics and how they affect system performance, and how to use Query Store to better understand your own workload.
