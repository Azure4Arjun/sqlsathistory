## Title: The Last Mile:  Dynamically Created Objects
## Abstract:
### Squeezing the last bit of performance out of you application after you have refactored your SQL and tuned your server and indexes can be frustrating.  Making it more difficult might be the requirement to keep a single code base for each user and company that can configure your application to work specifically for them.  One possible solution is tailoring programmable objects to each user.  It will provide SQL specific to the user's needs thereby ensuring they the best possible performance based on their configuration.
