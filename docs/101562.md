## Title: What's New in Tabular Editor
## Abstract:
### If you're building Analysis Services Tabular models, you've probably already heard of a small tool called Tabular Editor. The tool was released to the public a little over 3 years ago, and a lot has happened since then! In this session, I'm going to demonstrate the newest additions to the tool. Regardless of your experience level with Tabular Editor, I promise that you'll find many of the new features interesting, and that you won't ever look back to Visual Studio/SSDT for Tabular model development.
