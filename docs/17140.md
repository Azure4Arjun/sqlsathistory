## Title: Visualization – tales from the field.  How to build a cool Risk Analysis Dashboard on a shoestring
## Abstract:
### Visualization is all the rage – with the focus on Self-Service BI, In-Memory technology and fancy graphics. Tableau, QlikView and Microsoft PowerBi are showing off the eye-candy, and managers like what they see. However, either these solutions cost a lot of money, or your organization is stuck on older versions of software that lacks the functionality needed.
This session will show you how to make a cool dashboard using a database (MS SQL Server 2008), Excel 2010, and in addition how to prepare your solution for SQL2012 and the full PowerBI-suite with PowerPivot
