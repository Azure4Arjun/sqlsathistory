## Title: Loading a Data Warehouse with SSIS
## Abstract:
### You've just been assigned a data warehouse project. Maybe you've figured out what tables you want to work with, but outside of that you don't really know how to get started. In this session you'll learn how to load a data warehouse using SSIS, as well as techniques that you can use for any platform.
