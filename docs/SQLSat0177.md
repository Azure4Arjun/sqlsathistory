## Speaker: Dan Bulos
## Title: So Many BI Tools, So Little Time
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has a broad range of tools that can be used to create a BI application:  Power View, Reporting Services, and Excel (Pivot Tables  Power View) on the presentation side and SQL, Analysis Services (MOLAP  Tabular), PowerPivot, and Excel models on the data side.  Which ones should you use when?  Should an application mix and match or should an application focus on a limited set of tools?  While the technologies in each class have similarities (Power View, Reporting Services, and Pivot Tables all have bar charts), they are fundamentally different and should be used in different circumstances.  Compare the tools and learn nuances of each of them by seeing them in the context of real world examples.  See how choosing different tool str

## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Big Data for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### If you’re like most Database Administrators then you already work with data that is big, so what is this big data thing all about?  This session will cover the significance of big data by comparing and contrasting it to the SQL Server relational database environment.  It will also demonstrate the value a big data ecosystem can provide to your technology infrastructure organization by using it to complement your existing data architecture, and by having it co-exist in effective ways with your SQL Server databases. Live demonstrations will show how you to get maximum value out of big data with tools such as Sqoop, Hive and Pig so that you can perform bulk data transfers, queries, and ETL using SQL Server and HDFS, the Hadoop file system.

## Speaker: Chris Shaw
## Title: What is the Best Disaster Recovery Solution?
## Abstract:
### It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is.

## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

## Title: Secrets of Enterprise Data Mining
## Abstract:
### If you have a SQL Server license (Standard or higher) then you already have the ability to start data mining.  In this new presentation, you will see how to scale up data mining from the free Excel 2013 add-in to production use.  Aimed at beginning to intermediate data miners, this presentation will show how mining models move from development to production.  We will use SQL Server 2012 tools including SSMS, SSIS, and SSDT.

## Title: Demystifying Clustering for the DBA
## Abstract:
### The word cluster is used a lot in the IT world, especially when it comes to SQL Server. We have clustered instances of SQL Server, availability groups that require Windows failover clustering ... but how does a DBA make sense of it all? Wonder no more! This session will explain all the forms of clustering as they relate to SQL Server (including how Windows fits into the picture) and give you some of the top keys to success whether you are using an older version of Windows and SQL Server, or you're looking to deploy the latest and greatest.

## Speaker: Ami Levin
## Title: Where Are My (Primary) Keys?
## Abstract:
### In this session, we revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases—normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues—from a very hands-on, practical perspective. We also consider the benefits and challenges of using different types of keys (natural, surrogates, artificial, others) from multiple aspects, including data consistency, application development, maintenance, portability, and performance.
