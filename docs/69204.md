## Title: Building Your First Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder about those mysterious databases that are full of data?  Curious about what's inside, or how they are built?  Follow along in this session as we build a data warehouse from scratch.  Learn about fact tables, dimension tables, measures, and attributes as we work through a small data warehouse using Microsoft's newest sample database.  In this beginner level session, we will talk about data warehouse concepts, build a small data warehouse with a fact table and several dimensions, and implement an ETL process using T-SQL and stored procedures.
