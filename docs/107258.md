## Speaker: Andrey Nikolov
## Title: Double Power - Managing Power BI with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Power BI comes with a rich API, which you can use to perform various tasks. Administrators can enumerate workspaces, reports, dashboards and datasets, recover orphaned workspaces, or list all the data sources used in their organization. Users can make a backup of all their published reports. Developers can easily provision new instances of their reports for each new customer. In this session I will show various practical examples how you can do these tasks and explore what is possible even further. No previous PowerShell knowledge is required – it is THAT simple :)
