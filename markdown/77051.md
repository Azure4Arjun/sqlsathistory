## Title: SQL Server 2017 - Understanding Statistics
## Abstract:
### When analyzing Query plans understanding statistics and what role they play is a very important part. 
The session will be mostly demo based and will show you how to interpret the stats histogram and how SQL estimates the rows returned from a given table.
This will help you troubleshoot query performance at a more deeper level.
