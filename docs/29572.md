## Title: SharePoint Mashup: Internal Data for External Life
## Abstract:
### We are going to discuss the more technical aspects of cross-site data gathering using the SharePoint Object Model to drive cross-divisional information for rollups.  During the presentation, we will design and develop a practical solution for an external facing Mashup of Speaking Engagements with Speaker Biographies, mapped out using Bing Maps, and showing the latest tweets from the Speaker on Twitter.
