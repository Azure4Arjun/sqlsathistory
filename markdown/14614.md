## Title: SQL Server Security In An Insecure World
## Abstract:
### One of your first responsibilities of a SQL Server DBA is to safeguard the data and protect it from unauthorized access. 
Over and over we hear about hacker attacks and data leaks: if you don't want  to be the next Sony, you have to take action and activate all the available protection measures.
In this session you'll learn how attackers take advantage of weaknesses in your infrastructure and how to secure it using SQL Server security features and best practices.
