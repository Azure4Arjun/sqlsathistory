## Title: Are You Maintaining Your SQL Servers?
## Abstract:
### Are you performing all of the regular maintenance you should on your servers? Do you not run CHECKDB because "it takes too long"? How about Index Maintenance - does that take too long? Do you really have the appropriate backups in place?Do you have benchmark numbers in place to compare when your server is "slow"? Come discuss the answers to these and other questions - we will discuss the free Maintenance Solution scripted tools from Ola Hallengren and how they can help you fix these and other problems with a little easy coding you can do yourself. We will also discuss other tips and tricks to help you maintain and troubleshoot your SQL Server instances.
