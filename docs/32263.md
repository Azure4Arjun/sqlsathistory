## Speaker: Patrick LeBlanc
## Title: Speaking, Should I? (MINI)
## Abstract:
### I have been speaking for a while now.  My first speaking engagement was at the inaugural Baton Rouge SQL Server User Group in May 2008.  Was I nervous?  Sure I was, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed it.  Should you cross the line of attendee to speaker?  Join me as I share my experiences as a speaker and what I think it takes to become a good speaker.  You never know, you may realize that you should be speaking instead of in the audience.
