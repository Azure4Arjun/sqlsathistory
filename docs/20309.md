## Title: Power BI for Office 365 -  a Complete Self-Service
## Abstract:
### Power BI tools within Excel are available in the cloud with Office 365, allowing customers to access and share BI reports and models across the desktop and web, and all within a managed environment. Power BI for Office 365 includes Power Pivot and Power View, and two new Excel capabilities have been added to allow the over one billion Office 365 users the ability to do more with their data! These two new features are Power Query which was formerly Project Codename “Data Explorer”, and Power Map formerly Project Codename “Geoflow”.
