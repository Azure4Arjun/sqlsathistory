## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Feelings Quantified: Scoring, Storing, and Exploring Social Media Sentiment
## Abstract:
### The job of a data professional is evolving rapidly, driving many of us to platforms and technologies that were not on our radar screen a few months ago. I am certainly no exception to that trend. Most of us aren't just monitoring backups and tuning queries - we are collaborating with teams throughout the company to provide them data and insights that drive decisions. Cloud providers are democratizing technologies and techniques that were complicated and proprietary just a few months ago. This presentation walks you through how a silly idea from a football podcast got me thinking about how Azure Logic Apps, the Cognitive Services API, Azure SQL DB, and Power BI combine to provide potentially powerful insights to any company with a social media and sales presence. Join me as I walk you through building a solution that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours too!
