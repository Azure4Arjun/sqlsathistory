## Title: Baseline my Database
## Abstract:
### As a DBA I always get asked by my  DBA peers “How many I/Os, Deadlocks, Scans etc. does your database perform?”. Very valid question but in what context?

In this session I will propose concepts and raise important things to consider when implementing a baseline on a production database.
