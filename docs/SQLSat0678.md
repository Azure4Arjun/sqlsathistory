# Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#678---Orlando-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 14:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Troy Gallant
## Title: Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!
## Abstract:
### Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.

## Speaker: Patrick Keisler
## Title: SQL Audit - Evidence Never Lies
## Abstract:
### We've all heard about massive data breaches from big name companies. As a DBA, you should consider your company's data to be the most valuable assets. So when a data breach happens at your company, will you be able to provide management with the information? If not, then discover how SQL Server Audit can help provide you with an accurate forensic analysis of who did what to your data. In this session, we'll cover what SQL Audit can capture, how to set it up for both on-premise SQL Servers and Azure SQL Database, and finally produce reports from it.

# What’s new for SQL Server Analysis Services?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#678---Orlando-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 14:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: What’s new for SQL Server Analysis Services?
## Abstract:
### So, do we stick with the Cube or move to Tabular? Has DAX functionality improved enough to rely on performance with DirectQuery in a Tabular Model? Will we be porting Analysis Service (SSAS) databases to Azure? How do we know what level or pricing model is adequate for an Azure SSAS database?
When an SSAS database gets created, and users start to report against, it is very hard not to continue to expand the model. Anxiety is released when a new release of SSAS comes along adding functionality to replace the hooks created to satisfy user requirements. With 2016 and 2017, Microsoft is moving to update Tabular Models with more features, improved performance and better security. The Cube additions are mainly with Data Sources and better T-SQL generated to access source databases like Oracle and Teradata.
So, let us examine the pros and cons together and get a consensus of the path forward with SSAS. You are definitely not going to want to stop using this tool.

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#678---Orlando-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 14:30:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Daniel Janik
## Title: A DBA's guide to whole stack performance troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.

## Title: Tips on Managing Lots of SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### When managing a single server it is easy to keep track of the configuration of that server, but what about when you have more than ten servers to manage or a hundred? How do you know they are setup correctly? How do you maintain the databases on each server? How do you take care of patching? How do you know when your server is on fire?

In this talk we will answer these questions and more as we discuss technologies and approaches you can use to make sure your environment is configured and performing at its best.
