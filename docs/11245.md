## Title: What Excel 2013 really means for BI
## Abstract:
### Excel 2013 was silently packed with a slew of new BI features, including native integration of the PowerPivot and Power View add-ins. 

Come see some demos of how these new features work. Although you will see some pretty visualizations, there's more to Excel 2013 than dancing bubbles. There are some serious implications to taking advantage of these new technologies. Learn some of the trade-offs involved in taking advantage of these new features, especially when working with multiple data sources.
