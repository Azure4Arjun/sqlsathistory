## Title: SQL Server plan cache: The Phantom Menace [EN]
## Abstract:
### Every query you execute in SQL Server must have a plan...a plan, that defines how it is going to be executed. SQL Server Query Optimizer indeed does magic in preparing and reusing those plans, but sometimes we, as developers, need to help it (or at least do not interfere) so the database world is kept in peace. Join me in this advanced session where I will share the simple tricks that can save the day and help you write reusable code, even if you do not use stored procedures in your application.
