## Title: SQL Server 2016 - What module to use and why
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 has many modules and in this interactive session you get to ask us what challenges you have and we will come up with options for what parts of SQL 2016 would best work.   We will look at the relational engine, Anaysis Server, Reporting Services, Integration Services, and Management Studio.  You should come along if you are relatively new to SQL Server or are not so new but not had time to look at some of the other data platform capabilities of SQL 2016.  Bring your questions!
