## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. They are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allow us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without using any behind the scene triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. This session is full of demos.
