## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database Troubleshooting and Query Tuning 
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed, scalable service based on SQL Server technology. It is also a shared-environment service which means that you can’t and shouldn’t avoid best practices when it comes to query tuning. Microsoft has put mechanisms in place to ensure that your queries and processes don’t use up too many resources which could seriously impact performance of not only your database, but the database of other organizations as well. This demo-filled session will look at tools and options available to help identify poor performing queries, such as dynamic management views. This session will help identify problem queries and help you understand why a query is running slow through execution plans and other tools in the SQL Database Portal. Ultimately, you will be enabled to find and fix your poorly performing queries and do it all in the cloud.
