## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: A Deep Dive in SQL Server 2012 Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 brings strong support for data warehousing (DW). However, even in the previous versions there has been a lot of effort put in DW enhancements: star join optimization through bitmap filters, known from SQL Server 2008, table partitioning and basic window functions known from SQL Server 2005, indexed views, known from SQL Server 2000, and more. In SQL Server 2012, the Transact-SQL language is enhanced with advanced window functions. Columnstore indexes are a new way of storing data for efficient DW queries. This session explains the theoretical background for the enhancements and how they can be useful in a data warehousing scenario.

## Speaker: Niko Neugebauer
## Title: Inheriting a database for Developers, version 2
## Abstract:
### There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams. This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :) The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.

# SQL Injection: From Website to SQL Server

## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: SQL Injection: From Website to SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Injection is still one of the biggest reasons various websites and applications get hacked. The solution, as everyone tells us, is simple: Use SQL parameters. But is that enough?
In this session, we'll look at how an attacker would go about using SQL Injection to gain access to your database, see its schema and data, and do nasty stuff to both. Then we'll see how to battle such attacks at the UI front, the middle tier, and the SQL Server back end.

## Speaker: Turgay Sahtiyan
## Title: HA  DR with SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Group
## Abstract:
### The AlwaysOn Availability Groups feature is a high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring. Introduced in SQL Server 2012, AlwaysOn Availability Groups maximizes the availability of a set of user databases for an enterprise. In this session we will talk about what’s coming with Always On, and how does it help to improve high availability and disaster recovery solutions.
