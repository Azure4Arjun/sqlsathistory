## Title: Hacking Into SQL Server for Fun and Profit
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll explore several methods of hacking into SQL Server instances. Some methods assume you have Windows Administrator privileges on the box; others only require access to your physical network. We'll cover SQL injection, memory dumps, man-in-the-middle, pass-the-hash, and other attack vectors. Armed with this knowledge, you should be able to go back to your job and make a difference in your network security.
