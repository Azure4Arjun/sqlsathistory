## Title: DevOps for the DBA - Bridging the Gap Between Infrastructure, Administration, and Development
## Abstract:
### DevOps is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. At its core, this important concept represents a way to remove old barriers between the infrastructure, application, and development tiers within an IT organization. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server Database Administrators. Additionally, as hardware is increasingly virtualized, new opportunities for scripted deployment and configuration are available. This session will utilize demos to illustrate the many ways SQL Database Administrators can automate routine tasks from deployment through configuration.
