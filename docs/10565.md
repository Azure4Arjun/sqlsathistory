## Title: The Irish Economic Crisis Visualised with Power BI
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis from multiple perspectives, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.   It starts from a very common business angle, where people need to make sense of data, fast, but don't know what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.   This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis. Come by to find out what led to a small country owing over 200 billion euro and if Power BI could have helped.   Come and find out where all the money came from and what Ireland spent it on!
