## Title: SSIS Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### Developing a simple SSIS package is - mostly - relatively straight forward, however knowing some of the finer details about the engine can save time and lots of frustration.
Come along to this session and learn some tips and tricks that have been gained over many years.
Having additional knowledge and design patterns in your SSIS tool belt can be the difference between a very average package and one you, your manager, your team and your clients can be really happy and proud of.
