## Abstract:
### THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A DBA - Why piloting tactical jets and flying SQL Servers requires similar psychology and composure to ensure mission success during emergencies!

Let's face it, being a DBA is a stressful job.  Your performance in production environments matters greatly, even on the easiest of days. But when things go wrong, thatâ€™s when you really earn your money and discover the depth of your knowledge and your poise in emergency response.  

This training focuses on improving your successful handling of critical situations.  Content is based upon the collective knowledge gained by many people over many years in high performance aircraft.  Nick will share examples of how to, and how not to, handle stress in extremely difficult situations.  We will look at tried and true techniques that will help DBAs perform better when there is an actual emergency.  You will also learn about the teamwork and crew coordination often required to handle time-critical scenarios.
