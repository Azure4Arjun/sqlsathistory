## Title: Multi-Tenant Database Model with SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### This talk will focus on the benefits, features, and ease of use of SQL Azure. Learn how your projects can benefit from a hosted data storage and query processing service. See by example how to design your program to use SQL Azure. Real world topics and use cases will be covered including data sync and staying vendor independent while hosting your data in the cloud.  When you use the Multi-Tenant Database Model and SQL Azure together you can create a very powerful solution.  We'll start from scratch and go from design to deployment in this session.
