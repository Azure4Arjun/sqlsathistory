## Title: Data Mining Innovation with SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### This presentation includes a complex business analytics solution using elements across the Microsoft Business Intelligence technology.  This talk will not have all the steps spelled out.  Therefore you should prepare -- for example, by looking at the SQL Server 2012 Developer Kit -- since attendees will be expected to have working knowledge of SQL Server relational database, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, SSMS and SSDT.  Key elements of this solution will highlight features new to SQL Server 2012.  At the end of the demonstration, you will be expected to participate in groups to promote one idea which builds on the demo, and everyone will be voting for their favorite groups.  Come ready to create and celebrate your peers.
