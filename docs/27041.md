## Speaker: Tony Davis
## Title: You did WHAT to my transaction log?!
## Abstract:
### You won't believe what people will do to the transaction log when they get into trouble. The log is full! The application is experiencing strange errors! Do something! In this session, I will apply commonly suggested advice from internet search results and various forums, in search of a fast remedy for explosive log growth. How bad could it be?! Fortunately, once you understand what the transaction log looks like, how SQL Server uses it to guarantee database consistency, and the factors that can prevent reuse of log space, the dangers of 'quick fix' advice will become readily apparent, as will the right way to diagnose and fix a full log file. Note: no production servers will be harmed during this presentation.
