## Title: Building an Analytics Platform in Azure
## Abstract:
### Even though the Cloud is becoming more popular every day, most companies still want to host their Data Platform on-premises. However, the Cloud also offers huge potential in this area and technologies and tools - some of them only exist in the Cloud at all! This session focuses purely on Microsoft Azure and the services it provides to build a scalable, powerful and yet low-cost Analytics Platform in the Cloud. Based on a real-world scenario I will show how these components play together and how on-premises data and can be integrated into this pure Cloud system.
