## Title: Developing T-SQL that survives concurrency
## Abstract:
### Many T-SQL modules run correctly without concurrency, but they intermittently break when they are exposed to real life concurrency in OLTP systems. You will learn common real life scenarios when concurrency breaks T-SQL code. In addition, you will learn how to develop robust T-SQL which works correctly under concurrency.
