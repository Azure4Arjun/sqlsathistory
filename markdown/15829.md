## Title: Posh Eye for the BI Guy
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the many ways that PowerShell can help
with all aspects of the software development process.
Including Development, Deployment, and Administration. Specific
products in the stack covered will be SQL Server Reporting Services
(SSRS), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Analysis
Services (SSAS). We will spend time going over some basic project
structure and configuration management best practices as well. Some
previous minor exposure to PowerShell or .Net programming is assumed.
