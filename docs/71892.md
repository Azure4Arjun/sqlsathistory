## Title: Azure SQL DW Performance Common Issues
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Data Warehouse and APS are based on the MPP architecture. Analyzing the workload can be very different than SQL Server and SQL DB. In this session, we will show you what an MPP execution plan is, what to look for, and how to compare them to DMV output to pinpoint performance problems. We will use real customer scenarios to show you the most common causes of slowness and how we improved the performance. Please note: This session is intended for individuals with a 200 level understanding of MPP architecture with some understanding of data movement. There will be a short review of core components, but the discussion will quickly move to more advanced topics.
