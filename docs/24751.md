## Title: Bulletproof Database Deployments
## Abstract:
### Have you watched a DBA's facial expression when a developer says I'm giving you an automated deployment script?  How can you assure your DBA that it won't fail?  Deployment scripts a DBA runs may also be a risk.  Saying "it worked on my machine" doesn't cut it.       

Learn strategies to ensure your schema deployment goes smooth as silk.  Including how and when to test deployment scripts, how to keep in sync with production schema changes, how to write transactional deployment scripts, how to back out schema changes with minimal data loss, and other great tips.

You'll leave with a better understanding of these techniques and how a botched database deployment can be avoided.
