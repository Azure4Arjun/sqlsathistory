## Speaker: Martin Croft
## Title: Azure Data Studio – The 30-day challenge
## Abstract:
### Heard of dry January? Well, this the DBA equivalent. 
What is it? Why would I want to use this over Management Studio? Can I use it instead of Management Studio?  Martin will answer these questions – and more – and share with you what happened when as a DBA/Database professional he tried to exclusively use this instead of SSMS.  A month’s work of expertise to be shared in 60 minutes, detailing all the caveats and clever tricks needed to avoid pulling his hair out on a daily basis.
