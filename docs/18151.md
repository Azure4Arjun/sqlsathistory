## Title: Hive 101
## Abstract:
### Hive is the SQL like interface for Hadoop, aka Big Data. Hive was developed for two audiences, the newbie and, the hive developer. For the newbie almost any query will work in hive, eventually. The first part of the session will cover the differences between SQL and HQL so that anyone that has written a SQL query can start working with Hive. The second part of the session will cover the differences, at a high level, in how a traditional query engine works and how the Hive query engine works. We will discuss how the Hive query engine makes use of the distributed nature of Hadoop and what are considered best practices when writing Hive queries.
