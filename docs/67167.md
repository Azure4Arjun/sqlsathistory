## Title: Machine Learning for developers
## Abstract:
### Have you always heard the Machine learning concept and you put weird faces? In this session we will explain the main concepts in a very simple way. We will also see how Azure Machine Learning Studio will help us to create our experiments in an easy and simple way. We will also see how Python can help us executing some scripts that may be necessary to pre-process our data. Finally we show a demo developed in flask (python) that uses the azure ml studio API to perform a quantization process of different images using a clustering algorithm.
