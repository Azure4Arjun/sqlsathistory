## Title: DAX Evaluation Context
## Abstract:
### DAX is the query and programming language for Analysis Services tabular models, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "evaluation context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row context and filter context are and how to access them. You will learn functions which modify row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial context of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial context is created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter context using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.
