## Title: SSIS Package Logging
## Abstract:
### If you’ve ever worked with SSIS packages there’s no doubt you’ve been in a situation where all of the sudden the package does not behave in the way you'd expect it to and you need to quickly turn around with figuring out the cause and get the package running again. For simple packages, the task might be trivial, but as we work with more and more data and build complex ETLs using SSIS, it is necessary to have a detailed outlook into your package's execution and progress.
In this lecture we will go over the different approaches and best practices for logging for SSIS packages. We will also talk about the Integration Services Catalog in SSIS 2012, specifically its capabilities for tracing package execution. Finally we will cover the built-in reports in SSMS 2012.
