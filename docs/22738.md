## Title: SQL Database (Windows Azure)
## Abstract:
### SQL Database is part of the Windows Azure platform: a suite of services providing hosted computing, infrastructure, Web services, Reporting services and data services. The SQL Database component provides the relational database functionality of SQL Server, but it also provides functionality as a cloud-computing service, hosted in Microsoft data-centers around the globe. We will go over how it works and what it has to offer, as well as some of the differences and limitations.

***It is assumed that you have familiarity with SQL Server.
