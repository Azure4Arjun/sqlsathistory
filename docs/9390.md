## Title: Migration considerations for In-memory OLTP - What, Why, How and What not
## Abstract:
### In-memory OLTP is probably one of the most radical technologies to hit SQL Server in a long time. It has become the topic of endless discussions, debates, and the unavoidable myths. In this session we will cover the actual pains that drove the design of in-memory OLTP. We will understand WHAT it was created for, WHY it solves challenges that proved to be extremely hard to solve, HOW to find out if it is the right technology for you and not less important, what it was NOT designed for. We will cover a few real stories of applications that have utilized In-Memory OLTP successfully.
