## Speaker: Bradley Schacht
## Title: Intro to MPP Database with Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### When database servers slow down the options are generally to tune or scale up. Massively Parallel Processing, or MPP, databases offer an alternative: scale out. A traditional database engine uses a single processor and memory space to process queries while an MPP engine will divide and conquer by spreading the workload across multiple servers resulting in increased query performance. MPP databases don't operate the exact same as a traditional database engine. In this session Brad will explore the similarities and difference of operating in an MPP environment, dive into distribution theory, discuss join and aggregation compatibility, and get you up to speed on all the basics of MPP theory. By the end of the session you'll be well positioned to understand the design pattern differences, ETL considerations, and query basics of MPP databases.
