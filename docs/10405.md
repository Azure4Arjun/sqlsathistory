## Title: IO, IO, Why's my SQL Slow?
## Abstract:
### Disk I/O can be a significant performance bottleneck for SQL Server. And when physical I/O is the suspected culprit, the first thought is to purchase more storage. But expensive hardware upgrades donâ€™t necessarily ensure a faster database. So how do you determine how much I/O is contributing to poor performance? How can you assess the performance of a specific workload on different types of storage? And how do you decide which infrastructure is best for a specific storage solution?  

This presentation will cover :
The difference between latency, throughput, IOPS, and how they relate.
Performance characteristics of several storage solutions.
Techniques for analyzing storage subsystem performance.
How database design and infrastructure interact and impact performance and scalability.
