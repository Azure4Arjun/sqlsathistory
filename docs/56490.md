## Title: A Good DBA Works Smarter not Harder
## Abstract:
### How many instances of SQL are in your environment? Are there any rogue SQL Servers installed? Do you manage each of them? Do you know if they are setup correctly?

There are many free tools out there to help you effectively manage your environment.

In this session we are going to be interactive, we are going to talk about points of pain and we are going to zoom in on several free tools to help you identify, manage and maintain your SQL Server environments. We'll take these tools and take you on a journey from discovering your instances, configuring the discovered environment, setting up policies to keep things happy, implement maintenance and perform baselines and performance analysis.
