# Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-62)
Event Date: 15-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 7
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
## Abstract:
### Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

# Bad SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-62)
Event Date: 15-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Geoff Hiten
## Title: Bad SQL
## Abstract:
### How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.

# Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-62)
Event Date: 15-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 7
## Speaker: Ira Warren
## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture , via SSIS, that relys on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(developemnt effort) for generating the code required vs manual cosing. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.

# Do You Know the Data Flow?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-62)
Event Date: 15-01-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Do You Know the Data Flow?
## Abstract:
### The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: DR Availability,You're Wanted in the Recovery Room
## Abstract:
### There are a lot of options when it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with regards to SQL Server. Most business owners (and many DBA’s) lump disaster recovery (DR)  high availability (HA) together and while they do share some pieces, they call for different strategies. Do you pick one or more than one of these options, and based on what? It’s incredibly important that you understand the decision tree that helps you pick the right one(s) for your business, and that you can explain the choices clearly to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated – and in this hour presentation we’ll give you a high level understanding of the options, the costs, complexities,  reasons for using each of them.

## Title: Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: SSIS and SSRS Better Together
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  and Reporting Services (SSRS) are two pillars of Microsoft's Business Intelligence stack:  SSIS gathering the data and SSRS displaying the data.  Do you know that SSRS provides a set of Web Services that SSIS can use to manage and even render SSRS reports? In this session we will develop an SSIS package that exports an SSRS report to pdf format using these Web Services.  Then we will use the SSRS Web Services in a Data Flow Script Component to get data from a report.

## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Every data warehouse needs a date dimension to help users slice and dice data.  What should be included in the dimension, what is enough and what is too much?  Should you use the wizard to generate the dimension for you; what are the advantages and disadvantages?  We will explore a generic date dimension load script, loading a custom table and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time dimension.  Finally we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make an Order Date, Ship Date, Received Date exposed to users as opposed to multiple date dimensions.

## Title: How SQL saved my Business Intelligence Platform
## Abstract:
### The capabilities of SQL are appreciated by the PASS community, but when the end users express their love for SQL, that is pretty amazing. SQL 2005 actually saved a BI deployment from becoming an utter disaster and flipped it to an enormous success. We will explore the previous data model and how the adaptability of SQL made changes to the front end (changing from standard html output to allowing RIA and Ajax design tools) and extension of user capabilities possible without degrading performance or burdening the developers.

## Title: SQL Server Memory Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server. RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.

## Title: You inherited a database Now What?
## Abstract:
### You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks.  When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything.  At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited.
