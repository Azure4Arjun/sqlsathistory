## Title: Azure SQL Database: Maximizing Cloud Performance and Availability
## Abstract:
### When you move to Azure SQL Database, you select a predefined set of allocated resources across several dimensions such as CPU, memory, storage, and more. For a typical business application you need to find a balance between cost, performance demands and availability requirements. Yet for your mission critical application your focus moves toward the highest availability (i.e. 99.995% uptime) and performance. In this session we’ll review best practices around how to select your Azure SQL database configuration that is optimized for a specific application pattern and how to maximize its performance and availability.  We’ll review the natural advantages you can leverage from the Azure SQL Database ecosystem and detail factors to consider when optimizing for performance in the cloud, including application patterns and anti-patterns that you may encounter when migrating legacy applications from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.
