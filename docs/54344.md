## Title: Cluster Standalone SQL Server Instances at “Ludicrous” Speed
## Abstract:
### Join CTO of DH2i, OJ Ngo, for a live demo and discussion as he builds out a very unconventional SQL Server failover cluster. He will show you how to take standalone SQL Server instances on a mix of different OS and SQL Server versions/editions and transform them into an automated HA cluster with multi-subnet geo-clustering capability—all in just a few minutes.

With speed like that, there will still be plenty of time to show you:
•	QoS controls at the instance level
•	SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start
•	How this solution can save you 30-60% on licensing costs

Stop slaving over your traditional WSFC environments and learn why Global 500 customers have adopted this profoundly simple, Microsoft certified solution.
