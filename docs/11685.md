## Title: Transactional Replication Beginner to Expert
## Abstract:
### Learn what use cases you can use transactional replication for and then dive in to tuning and troubleshooting techniques that can work for all replication types. We will cover best practices for DB and drive setup and the use of custom agent profiles. See examples of custom monitoring emails so you don't have to watch replication monitor all the time.
