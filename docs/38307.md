## Title: In-Memory OLTP Vol1 – XTP Fundamentals  Future Development
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2014 introduced a completely new storage engine: XTP (Codename “Hekaton”) which offers so called memory optimized tables + indexes and natively compiled stored procedures. Both features together enable for potentially enormous performance-gains: from 3 up to 30 times compared with standard indexes and standard T-SQL. Of course, practice is somewhat more complex and it is important to understand which workloads truly can benefit from this technology and what migration challenges you may encounter. In this introductory session, enriched with a few demos, I will make sure, that everyone gets a basic understanding of In-Memory OLTP concepts and terminology. Also we will take a first glance on the upcoming SQL Server 2016 developments in In-Memory, which combine the mighty ColumnStore technology for DataWarehousing with XTP under the marketing-term "Real-time Operational Analytics  In-Memory OLTP".
