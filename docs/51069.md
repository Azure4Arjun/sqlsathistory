## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Do you still prefer troubleshooting issues using SQL Server Profiler, because you find Extended Events too complicated? Or is it because you have never used Extended Events before, or it was in the dark ages of 2008 and your love for XML wasnâ€™t strong enough to make you use them? The good news are that the recent versions of SQL Server give you a nice UI and made it all as user friendly as possible. The bad news are that you have no excuse anymore to not use them! Join this session to learn the basics of SQL Server Extended Events. You will see example use cases that could make your life easier and will learn how to troubleshoot issues in a modern and efficient way.
