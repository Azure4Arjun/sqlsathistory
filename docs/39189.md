## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
Many people are forced to use Microsoft#174; SharePoint#174; because it is already there or part of the Office 365™ ecosystem; therefore many users see it just as another task to add to their burgeoning  workload of tasks they have to complete in their busy working day. When any technology is introduced into a business it should help not hinder users. It should enable users to do more, not less. Technology should meet business needs and not be focused around a single product.

With this in mind, Penny will look at automating business processes using out-of-the-box functionality of SharePoint and with the use of Azure™ Logic Apps outside SharePoint, beyond firewalls and beyond even your own datacentre. You can create these workflows using no-code visual designers.
