## Title: Monitoring and Alerting for an Azure PaaS application
## Abstract:
### The support of PaaS applications is a challenging task. These systems consist of multiple loosely coupled cloud services and components using a Service Oriented Architecture. You must monitor their availability and resource usage along with overall system health via custom End-to-End tests. 
This session will show how to setup and configure monitoring and alerting on individual components in both the Azure portal and Application Insights including an operational dashboard that ensures the PaaS application remains healthy and available.
