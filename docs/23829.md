## Title: Using Filetables
## Abstract:
### The FileStream feature was introduced with SQL Server 2008 allowing BLOBs to be managed by the DB. In 2012, FileTable expands on this feature by using specific tables for storing these BLOBs. This allows Windows apps to access these items as if there were stored on the file system.
