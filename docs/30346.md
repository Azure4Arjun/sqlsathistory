## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: All about MERGE
## Abstract:
### The MERGE statement was introduced in SQL Server 2008, and it offers a tremendous value.
Most people do know the basic function of MERGE: synchronising imported data with base data by inserting new rows and updating existing rows, all in one go. But MERGE can do much, much more.
In this demo-rich session, Hugo Kornelis will present the full syntax of the MERGE statement, explain all the options, and show the possibilities. He will also demonstrate that the introduction of MERGE might have made your existing triggers incorrect, and how to fix the problems.
