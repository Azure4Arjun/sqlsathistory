## Title: Dive into SSIS Catalog and SSISDB using PowerBI
## Abstract:
### If you have worked with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 or above for few years then you already familiar with SSIS Catalog reports. SSISDB Catalog reports - help us to monitor projects, which you have deployed to the server. By using these reports, we can quickly find information related to executions, logging and other interesting things with few mouse clicks. However, have you ever wondered how to design an SSIS Project so we can take maximum benefit of SSISDB Catalog? How to troubleshoot SSIS Project executions from the Catalog? How to navigate your way around the built-in catalog reports? How to design a dashboard with SSIDB Catalog data? This session will focus on these scenarios by diving into SSISDB catalog views using PowerBI.
