## Title: Zen and the Art of Perfmon
## Abstract:
### If your boss asked you for the list of the five most CPU-hungry databases in your environment six months from now for an upcoming licensing review, could you come up with an answer? Performance data can be overwhelming, but you can make sense of the mess. Twisting your brain and looking at the data in different ways can help you identify resource bottlenecks that are limiting your SQL Server performance today. Painting a clear picture of what your servers should be doing can help alert you when something is abnormal. Trending this data over time will help you project how much resource consumption you will have months away. Come learn how to extract meaning from your performance trends and how to use it to proactively manage the resource consumption from your SQL Servers.
