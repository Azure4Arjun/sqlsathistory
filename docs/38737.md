## Title: Zero-Downtime Upgrades: Rockstar DBA
## Abstract:
### SQL Server upgrades bring enticing new features and much needed enhancements, but can you perform them while maintaining high availability of your SQL Server infrastructure? 

You can actually do this by leveraging rolling upgrades, which are upgrades performed with minimal downtime or service disruptions.

In this session you will: 
* Understand how rolling upgrades are better than in place upgrades 
* Learn how to use database mirroring or AlwaysOn Availability Groups for rolling upgrades 
* Explore how you might use Log Shipping to perform a simpler type of rolling upgrade 

This is a demo-intensive session, so you can see rolling upgrades live and up close. 

If you are considering upgrading to a major version of SQL Server, or just applying a Service Pack or a Cumulative Update, this session is for you!
