## Title: T-SQL Enhancements in SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### The release of SQL Server 2008 represents a paradigm shift in the way that we program T-SQL.  With new commands and new data types, 2008 provides the SQL developer with a bevy of options intended to make their development tasks easier.  In this session, we will explore what enhancements have been made to T-SQL including (but not limited to) row constructors, the MERGE statement, table-valued parameters as well as what new data types are available to us.
