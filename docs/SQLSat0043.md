# Tuna Helper for DBAs and Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#43---Redmond-2010)
Event Date: 12-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 2003
## Speaker: Dean Richards
## Title: Tuna Helper for DBAs and Developers
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process I use with great success and it will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and others that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

# Auditing your SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#43---Redmond-2010)
Event Date: 12-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 2011
## Speaker: David Lydston
## Title: Auditing your SQL Server
## Abstract:
### New in SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition is a feature called SQL Audit.  This feature allows you to record statements executed against the SQL Server at the server and database scopes, for database, schema and object classes.  Unlike prior features that could be used for capturing these statements, SQL Audit allows the user, greater granularity in statements captured, multiple output targets, and the ability to capture statements previously un-captureable. In this presentation, code will be presented to setup and monitor SQL Audits along with tips and additional code to enhance your SQL Server auditing experience.

# The Compression Session
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#43---Redmond-2010)
Event Date: 12-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 2015
## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: The Compression Session
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 allows you to compress your data in several different ways. Your tables can be compressed using row compression or page compression, and your can also choose to compress your backups. In this session we'll look at what kinds of data give you the most space savings when compressed, and we'll also discuss the algorithms SQL Server uses to compress your data. Knowing how SQL Server performs compression will allow us to evalutate when the space savings will be worth the cost, and when you might want to avoid compression.

## Title: SSIS Performance Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Need a fast data integration solution, but don't have the time or budget for heavy performance tuning? Come learn how to maximize your ROI by applying trusted design patterns to your Integration Services packages. We talk about how to set performance expectations, and how to put together a simple framework to record benchmarks for your ETL process. We go over the basics of smart package design, and then look at a number of design patterns for common data warehousing problems, such as Slowly Changing Dimension processing, Range Lookups, and Change Detection.

# Replication Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#43---Redmond-2010)
Event Date: 12-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 2015
## Speaker: Chuck Lathrope
## Title: Replication Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### This session is for users who want to improve their throughput using Replication Profiles and Server/Networking tweaks. I will also cover custom monitoring stored procedures that don't require you to keep replication monitor on all the time. Last item covered are some queries you can use to see replication errors and common solutions to them. It is expected that you know how to setup replication.

# Data Warehouse Dimension Processing with SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#43---Redmond-2010)
Event Date: 12-06-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 2011
## Speaker: Todd McDermid
## Title: Data Warehouse Dimension Processing with SSIS
## Abstract:
### The SCD Wizard included in Integration Services is easy to use, and has all the features you need for smaller, simple dimension processing. However, it is not the easiest component to adjust, and doesn't perform very well with larger dimensions. This session will cover three alternative techniques for processing changes to dimension tables within SSIS: "rolling your own SCD" with Lookups and Conditional Splits, using the T-SQL MERGE statement, and the Kimball Method SCD component. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique will be described and demonstrated.
