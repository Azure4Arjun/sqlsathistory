## Speaker: Scott Shaw
## Title: Dimensional Modeling for the Everyday DBA
## Abstract:
### This session will work to relieve the skepticism and mysticism around dimensional modeling. If, like me, you've grown up in IT with normalization hammered into your head we'll walk through why in large data warehouses and cubes you need to think differently.  You'll learn the basic terminology of dimensional modeling and you'll learn where it all started and where it is going. By the end of the session you'll learn to accept denormalization as the solution to some very specific problems.
