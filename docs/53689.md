## Title: Beyond Relational with SQL 2016
## Abstract:
### There is a saying "no man is an island", and that holds true for SQL Server as well. 

In your organization you have data stored all over the place, and your data may not always be relational. In this talk we will see how you can handle both relational as well a non relational data in SQL Server 2016. Among the things we will talk about are JSON support, Hadoop and Polybase.
