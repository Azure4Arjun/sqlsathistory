## Title: Loading Data with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### In this session we’ll take a look at how to load data into SQL Server using various data sources such as: text, csv, table.  We’ll also load data from XML files; update data inside of XML files; and even kick off SSIS packages all from PowerShell.  Finally we'll re-use our newly found XML scills to modify an SSIS package before we run it.
