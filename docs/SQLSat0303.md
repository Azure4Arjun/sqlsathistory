# Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-303)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular
## Abstract:
### The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

# Bridging the Chasm:  BI Theory vs. Practice
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-303)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Bridging the Chasm:  BI Theory vs. Practice
## Abstract:
### A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.

# The Modern Data Warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-303)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Andy Roberts
## Title: The Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Current models of data warehousing are being challenged by data that is coming at us bigger, faster, and more variable that it ever has before. In traditional models we would throw out much of the data or aggregate to a course grain so that we could gain query performance but may loose some of the nuance needed for deep analytics. How is Microsoft bridging the GAP between the need for speed in both data ingestion and query performance? How is Microsoft integrating the worlds of relational and non-relational data? This session will discuss aspects of Microsoft's data warehouse vision ranging from traditional SMP, our MPP appliance, what we are doing in the cloud and how it all works together.

# Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-303)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting
## Abstract:
### You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.
