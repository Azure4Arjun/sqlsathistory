## Title: Using StudioShell to Automate Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### StudioShell is an open-source deeply integrated PowerShell host available inside of Visual Studio 2010. It’s goal is to fundamentally change the way you interact with your IDE and your code.  It exposes many of Visual Studio’s extensibility points in a simple and consistent way, and it makes the Visual Studio programmability features interactive and discoverable. What an add-in does in a compiled binary, StudioShell can accomplish with a one-liner.  Come see the possibilities in a session of practical demonstrations given by the author.
