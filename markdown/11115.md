## Title: BIML--Step by Step
## Abstract:
###  BIML--Business Intelligence Markup Language is your key to faster development of SSIS Packages. This session will guide you through an introduction to BIML. We'll explore the capabilities of BIML and BIMLScript, available through the free Codeplex BIDSHelper download. We'll move through basic syntax of plain BIML, and progress to BIMLScript, using LINQ, and Lambda expressions to access enterprise metadata, speeding SSIS development exponentially.
