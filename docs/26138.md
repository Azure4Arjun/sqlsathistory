## Title: Security for your BI data
## Abstract:
### How the manage security for your data during the ETL and reporting process across multiple servers and in HA/DR situations. 
Handling permissions on a read only copy (readable mirror or snapshot) or individual permissions on a column are just two examples of topics this session filled with best practices will cover. After covering the protection of the raw data we will have a look at all the tools (SSRS, SSIS, SSAS, ...) and how to secure them as well.
