## Title: Tuning optional filters
## Abstract:
### "Catch-all" queries are very common, found in nearly every database. You know those "give me a row with this @ID or give me all rows if @ID is -1"? That is an optional filter, and probably you have a combination of multiple. Tuning them is a nightmare that sometimes even professionals fail to solve completely. Such queries are sometimes fast and suddenly get slow without apparent reason, bringing server to its knees if often executed. You will see the secret mastery and wizardry of achieving the best possible performance for those queries, and understand internals of SQL Server deeper than before. Bringing your company huge benefits in smooth databases performance and increase your customers' satisfaction.
