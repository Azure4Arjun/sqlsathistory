## Title: Power to the Prototypes: Using Power BI to Deliver Better SQL Reporting
## Abstract:
### As SQL Server professionals, we have a complicated relationship with Excel-based tools. Rather than broadly paint Excel as friend or foe, why not learn how Power Query  Power Pivot can improve the SQL Server solutions you develop? In this session, we’ll cover scenarios where Power Query and Power Pivot can be leveraged to get the most from the proof-of-concept phase of your reporting, ETL,  analytics projects. Learn how Power Query can help you test the quality of your data well before the production ETL is deployed. We’ll also cover how Power Pivot can help you visualize the structure and granularity of your data, and why it’s the perfect “gateway drug” for SSAS cube development.  If you've ever had a BI project fall flat because “We didn't know what we didn't know” or want to avoid delivering a hundred reports when the data merits ten, this is the session for you!
