## Title: Backups  Restores: Youâ€™re Not In Kansas Anymore!
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been in Kansas and have a random house drop on you?  Ok, probably not, but the moral of the question is that you never know when a house might fall out of the sky and you certainly don't want to be caught under it when it does!.  Not understanding database backups  restores is just like having a house crash down on around your ears.  Loud, noisy and sometimes hard to put the pieces back together.  As a follower of the Yellow Database Road, You have to be ready for said event.  Now how do you do that you ask?  You come to this session about Backups  Restores.  We'll talk about how to use them to help avoid having a house fall on your head!
