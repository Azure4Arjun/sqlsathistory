## Title: SQL Server 2014 New Features
## Abstract:
### There is MUCH more to SQL Server 2014 than just Hekaton and Updatable Column Store Indexes!!  This session will be a medium-to-high-level overview of many of the new features and enhancements coming in SQL Server 2014.  When I thought of doing this session I initially wanted to have some demos, but there are SOOO many things to cover I couldn't fit in any demos in a 1 hour session!
