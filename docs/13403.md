## Title: A Heart ot Heart with the Business User
## Abstract:
### This session discusses how we can deliver a better BI product if we learn to better communicate with the business user and get then to think differently about data and about their needs.

Attendees will gain an understanding of how to initiate conversations and begin a process of increasing the quality of user requirements. They will also learn how to start and develop this process to get user buy in. The end goal is to fully utilize BI capabilities to reduce costs, improve performance or identify new business opportunities.
