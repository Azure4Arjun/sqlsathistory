## Title: Designing  Building Highly Available Solutions
## Abstract:
### Building a system that is Highly Available is something that requires a lot of thought and work up-front, it is not something that is easy to add after the system is built.

In this session I will help you understand the questions you need to ask, the options that are available to you and design principals  technology that can be leveraged to build a solution that can meet your needs and the needs of your business. Covering elements from the physical storage all the way out to the client application connectivity, we will look at just what it takes to build something that can sustain component failures and keep functioning.

So no matter whether your systems are cloud resident, on-premises or hybrid we will look at how you can make sure they work as planned.
