## Title: Windows Clustering for the DBA Part 1
## Abstract:
### You need to implement AlwaysOn Failover Clustering or Availability Groups, but need help with the Windows Clustering part.  This session will guide you to success.  We'll talk about how to plan your network, DNS, Active Directory, and storage.  I'll provide you with a check list you can use to plan your implementation.  We'll see how to choose the right quorum model for a robust failover configuration that ensures your database is always available.
