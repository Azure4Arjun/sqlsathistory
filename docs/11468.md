## Title: Extended Events in SQL Server 2008 and 2012
## Abstract:
### I will demonstrate practical examples of how to use Extended Events to figure out details of what SQL Server is doing when problems are occuring. You can dig deep into the internals of SQL Server with Extended Events since they track operations at a very low level. Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 but have not been used that much because of the learning curve. SQL Server 2012 has promoted Extended Events to a much more important level. The feature is now ready to replace Profiler as the primary tool to gather real time details of query execution. The majority of my presentation will be demoing real world problem solving.
