## Title: A Concept for Clean Reporting: Information Design Rules for SSRS and R
## Abstract:
### The statistical language R has many ways to visualize data, as does SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). In this session, we take our two favorite methods and show you concepts to standardize and support these languages under the focus of a centralized information-design management. We take ICB standards and proposals for a conceptual, perceptual, and semantic information design and apply it to both languages, with the help of Master Data Services. You will see the concepts, techniques, and visual output in live demos and take away a concept that you can apply to your own SSRS reports or R output.
