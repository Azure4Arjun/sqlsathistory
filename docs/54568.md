## Title: SQL Server 2016: Temporal Tables and Dynamic Data Masking
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduces many new features and enhancements. This session will look into two of those: Temporal Tables and Dynamic Data Masking. Temporal Tables simplifies the task of building a history table to track all data changes so that you can see how the data looked at a specific point in time, while Dynamic Data Masking is used to obfuscate data from users (for example, show just the last 4 characters of your SSN). This session is >90% demos!
