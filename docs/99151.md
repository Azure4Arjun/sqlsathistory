## Title: ETL Best Practices and Techniques
## Abstract:
### ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is the backbone of any data project and can be upwards of 70% or more of the effort. The tools you have access to allow you to make progress in a hurry. However, are you implementing best practices and techniques that will scale to the demands you need? Or will you be refactoring far too quickly than you should to meet performance requirements?

Gian helpful insights from decades of lessons learned and walk away with best practices you can implement in your own ETL solution.
