## Title: How to simplify a scientists life – PowerBI, R and an applied statistics
## Abstract:
### How to simplify a scientists life – PowerBI, R and an excursus to applied statistics.

In the last years several research fields have been revolutionized by the invention of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods and as a result the amount of data generated in a single experiment has increased remarkably and can now easily exceed several GB. 
The analysis of these comparably big amounts of data has become challenging because established software and workflows are often not applicable for these big amounts of data or make the analysis of the data to an time consuming and frustrating work step. 
In this talk I’ll show how the use of PowerBI simplified my daily routine. I’ll provide insight into the daily struggles a scientist has to deal with and why the implementation of R into PowerBI made this tool to my first choice when it comes to visualizing and analyzing big amounts of data. 
Every project has its own hypotheses and it is the overreaching goal of every experiment to prove
