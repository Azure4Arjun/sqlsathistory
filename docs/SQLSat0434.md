# Boost your analytical superpowers with spatial data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#434---Holland-2015)
Event Date: 26-09-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Data Science
## Speaker: Jeffrey Verheul
## Title: Boost your analytical superpowers with spatial data
## Abstract:
### Analyzing huge sets of data isn't something humans are made for. Humans are more suitable for making decisions based on things they can see. So how do you bring that into the business? One of the options you have is to visualize some of your (location based) data on maps. A feature for this in SQL Server is called spatial data (geo data). By using physical locations and shapes to visualize data, you can quickly analyze big sets of data.

In this session, we're going to take a look at how spatial data works, how you can query it, and how to use it to leverage your decision making process.

## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From? - Part 1
## Abstract:
### NB: This is part one of a two-part session
The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?
In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.
Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.

### Data science, predictive analytics, insights, statistics… There are so many buzzwords around these days. These words are frequently used in an introduction to some technical article, at the beginning of a presentation, and even in regular talk. However, when it comes down to a real analysis, you typically get reports with very nice Power BI graphs, but without real forecasting. It is up to you to recognize the patterns and then probably make some kind of interpolation by yourself. Data mining is the part that is based on statistics and can really make forecasts automatically. Data mining is part of SSAS installed in multidimensional mode. Is it possible to get the best from both words? This advanced session explains the forecasting algorithms and shows how you can integrate geographic and temporal predictions in Power View and Power Map visualizations and interactive animations. Popular buzzwords finally get some real meat behind them.

## Title: Moving away from SQL Profiler to use Extended Events
## Abstract:
### This session will guide you with practical tips  tricks to move away from SQL Profiler and use Extended Events instead.
Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 and should be used instead of the SQL Profiler. Still lots of DBA's and DEV's use SQL Profiler nowadays because of the convenience and lack of an Extended Events GUI in SQL 2008. 
Extended events however impose a minimal performance penalty on SQL Server and provides much more detailed tracing.
