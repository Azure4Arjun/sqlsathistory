## Title: 3D Geospatial Visualization Using Power Map
## Abstract:
### Power Map, formerly called GeoFlow, is one of Microsoft’s latest releases in the BI spectrum. It provides for 3D geospatial and temporal visualization of data. In this session we’ll first compare and contrast the geospatial reporting capabilities of SSRS, Power View, and Power Map. We’ll then quickly learn the Power Map tool and create some interactive geospatial animated tours. We’ll also discuss the concept of datums, which is relevant for those using latitude and longitude.
