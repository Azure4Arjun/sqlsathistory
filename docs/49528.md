## Title: From SSMS to SSDT why and how to move your SQL database development to SSDT
## Abstract:
### SSMS is the love child of what was Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager and has ever since been used as the dev tool of choice for people creating and modifying database schemas and code. Whilst SSMS is a really good management tool it is not suited to modern development. Instead Microsoft has created SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) which has had a lot of attention from Microsoft in the last few years which means that it is now ready for us to use full time.

We will cover:

* How to get your databases into SSDT and critically how to get them to compile correctly.
* A tour of the SSDT features that show how T-SQL development is actually easier and how SSDT makes you more productive
* The build  deployment process so you can start concentrating on writing useful code instead of upgrade and release scripts.

If you write, debug or modify SQL Server database code and haven't yet started using SSDT full time then this session will help you get started and be productive quickly.
