## Title: More Unecessary Query Tuning
## Abstract:
### Pronounced muck, this session walks you through common but recurring coding problems, how to identify them, and how to solve them. Based on the book, SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Tuning Distilled, this session covers the information that query developers—which includes DBAs, application developers, report writers, and other data management professionals—need to know about in order to prevent recurring problems caused by poorly written or poorly configured code. Topics include things as simple as getting the data types correct, including the schema in defining objects, and avoiding operators in search conditions. More advanced topics are also discussed.
