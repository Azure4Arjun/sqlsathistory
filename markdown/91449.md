## Title: Predictive Analytics - an Azure Machine Learning-Studio Use-Case
## Abstract:
### Machine learning is based on samples, and samples are built on your data: log data, CRM data, whatever.
In this session we learn about what is Azure Machine Learning-Studio with an example use case of learning music styles and/or alcoholic drinks to classify a custom article. 
We show how to load samples from a database and/or table storage to Azure Machine Learning-Studio, train and verify your model and generate a ready-to-run image to deploy with your Docker / Kubernetes services. So you can run the rate engine in the cloud or on-prem datacenter, or even on your client using Docker and/or WindowsML. 
Demo heavy talk.
