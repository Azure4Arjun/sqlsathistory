## Title: DevOps for Databases
## Abstract:
### What is the majority of applications without a database? The focus has been on developer practices and code quality, but the database has been long forgotten. In this session, I will show you how the database becomes a 1st class citizen in the development/DevOps processes. We will look at how to go about evaluating, testing and deploying databases for quick turnaround and continuous deployment.
