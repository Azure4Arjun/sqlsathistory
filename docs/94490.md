## Title: "Kubernetify" your SQL Server Containers
## Abstract:
### We have all now had a play around with Docker and Containers or at least heard about them.

This demo heavy session will walk through some of the challenges around managing container environments and how Kubernetes orchestration can help alleviate some of the pain points. 

We will be talking about what Kubernetes is and how it works and through the use of demos we will:

- Highlight some of the issues with getting setup, 
- Deploying/Updating containers in Kubernetes 
- Persisting data
- How to avoid making the same mistakes as I have
