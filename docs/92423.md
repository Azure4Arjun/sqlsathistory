## Title: Understanding Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### Starting with SQL Server 2019 preview, SQL Server Big Data Clusters allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers running on Kubernetes. These components are running side by side to enable you to read, write, and process big data from Transact-SQL or Spark, allowing you to easily combine and analyze your high-value relational data with high-volume big data.
In this session we will explore the technology and business/use cases for using SQL Server Big Data Clusters within your organisation. Welcome to the future of SQL Server.
