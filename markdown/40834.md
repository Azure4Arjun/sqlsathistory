## Title: Overview of Open-Source Tools of the Hortonworks Data Platform
## Abstract:
### I will present an overview of the open-source tools of the Hortonworks Data Platform for Hadoop applications development. In particular, we will examine (1) Sqoop for moving data between relational databases and Hadoop, (2) Pig as a platform for complex data transformations and (3) Hive as a tool for data analysis that allows writing ad-hoc SQL-like queries against large datasets.
