## Title: Continuous Integration for Analysis Services?
## Abstract:
### Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are well used methods in modern software engineering approaches and can help reduce workload, risks and therefore costs significantly. But Business Intelligence projects and amongst those especially Analysis Services projects offer certain challenges to the appliance of those methods. Comprehensive support by software vendors is definitely not given. So if you want to integrate those methods into your application life-cycle management (ALM) you probably will need to build your own solution. We will shortly recap definition and advantages of CI and CD. After a short analysis of the special challenges for BI projects we will dive into possible approaches. And let's try to find out if cloud services can be of significant importance.
