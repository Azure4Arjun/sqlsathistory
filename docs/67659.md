If you are releasing database changes, new reports, cubes or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
DevOps is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the toolchain to support the practices. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

Agile Development Frame of Mind
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/PBI/WI (concept)
Team Foundation Server
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)
PowerShell
	Microsoft's "Glue" (tool)
