## Title: Performance Tuning SQL Server with sp_AskBrent#174; and sp_BlitzCache#174;
## Abstract:
### You've already got a SQL Server application in production, and users are complaining about speed. You need to find the bottleneck as quickly as possible, and identify which queries are causing that bottleneck. In this session, you'll learn how to use free tools to quickly analyze your server's performance and pinpoint exactly which queries need to be tuned.

This session is for developers and DBAs who can change queries and indexes on their servers to speed up performance.
