## Title: The Business Intelligence Management Data Mart
## Abstract:
### Once you've built you're Business Intelligence ecosystem, you want to ensure that everything is running smoothly. SSIS packages should be timely, analysis services databases should be logging their usage, and reports should be monitored for improvement where, and when, possible. In this session, we'll start out by discussing why a management data mart is a good thing, and why you need this tool in your business intelligence environment to properly monitor and manage usage. Later, we'll discuss how to report off of this new data mart and the best way to deliver this report to management or your DBA for some much needed insight.
