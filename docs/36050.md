## Title: Developing Production Quality SQL Code
## Abstract:
### Most of the training we receive as SQL Server professionals has code developed for the purpose of demoing or providing training for a specific feature. I’ve developed my share of demo code and it serves it purpose. This session is different. I’ll quickly demo my company’s application (so you can get a sense of what it does), and then walk through many key portions of the actual T-SQL code showing you how the techniques I’ve used to make it production worthy with a focus on robustness, security, and performance. note: this session includes a LOT of dynamic SQL.
