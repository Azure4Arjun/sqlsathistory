## Speaker: Edward Roepe
## Title: The Ultimate Maintenance Plan
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.
