## Title: ABCs of CDC with SSIS 2012
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 added full support for Change Data Capture (CDC) on databases. In this session we will cover the basics of CDC in SQL Server 2012 and then how to build SSIS 2012 packages that make using CDC to load your Data Warehouses easier than they were before. No previous knowledge of CDC is required for this session, but some knowledge of any version of SSIS will make it easier to understand.
