## Title: Kubernetes Zero to Hero - Installation, Configuration, and Applic
## Abstract:
### Modern application deployment needs to be fast and consistent to keep up with business objectives and Kubernetes is quickly becoming the standard for deploying container-based applications, fast. In this day-long session, we will start with an architectural overview of a Kubernetes cluster and how it manages application state. Then we will learn how to build a production-ready cluster. With our cluster up and running, we will learn how to interact with our cluster, common administrative tasks, then wrap up with how to deploy applications and SQL Server. At the end of the session, you will know how to set up a Kubernetes cluster, manage a cluster, deploy applications and databases, and how to keep everything up and running.

Session Objectives
• Introduce Kubernetes Cluster Components
• Introduce Kubernetes API Objects and Controllers
• Installing Kubernetes
• Interacting with your cluster
• Storing persistent data in Kubernetes
• Deploying Applications in Kubernetes
