## Title: Creating Your Own ETL Automation Framework with Biml for Beginners
## Abstract:
### You may have heard of Business Intelligence Markup Language or even tried to learn it. But how can you take the time to learn it, while getting the rest of your work done. In this highly interactive presentation, I’ll guide you through the process of learning/using Biml, without sacrificing your daily productivity.

We’ll cover how to: 
Identify “easy” ETL patterns to BimlScript
Take incremental steps in automating these processes
Move to metadata driven BimlScript
Tie it all together into a full-fledged framework

As a bonus, you’ll leave the presentation with a completed framework which dynamically generates most types of flat files that you can use in your own environment.
