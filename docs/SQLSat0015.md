# RESTful Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#15-Jacksonville-2009)
Event Date: 02-05-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 1002
## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: RESTful Data
## Abstract:
### REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: The Truth About Disk Performance and Configuration
## Abstract:
### Would you buy a million dollar race car then show up to the track on a clear day with rain tires that aren’t properly inflated and wonder why you’re only doing 180 when the manufacturer says it can do 220? Your answer was probably close to something like "Of course not!". Now let’s suppose that your million dollar race car is really your DB server and your tires are your hard drives. Do you know the right configuration to use to get the best performance out of them? Sure, there's RAID 1, RAID 10, and RAID 5 but do you know which combination of partition offset, RAID stripe size, and allocation unit size to use? This session will answer those questions by looking at the results of extensive testing performed against local disks and DASD encl
