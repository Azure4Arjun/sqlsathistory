## Speaker: Ian Meade
## Title: A temporary fix for a short term problem 
## Abstract:
### Finding the best way to implement complex logic in TSQL can be more challenging then you’d expect. Often, the developer just makes the query bigger and more complex but this is not always ideal. We’ll look at how and when you should split larger queries into smaller chunks. We’ll explore the implication of larger queries, using temporary tables, table variables, functions and view, derived tables and sub queries and CTEs.
