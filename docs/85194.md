## Title: Connecting SQL and Blockchain: The Azure Blockchain Workbench [EN]
## Abstract:
### Getting a PoC for a Blockchain project running is hard enough. Connecting Blockchain data to classical databases, making them available to analytics or standard applications is worse (ever queried LevelDB?).
Microsofts  new "Azure Blockchain Workbench" let you do this in hours, not months. 
We will see how to
- Deploy a Blockchain on Azure in a breeze
- Generate templates for smart contracts
- Connect them to IoT devices
- Interact with the contracts via a simple UI
- Get all the data into a "real" database automatically
