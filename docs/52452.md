## Speaker: Simon Cho
## Title: Build ETL efficiently (10x) with Minimal Logging
## Abstract:
### This session is designed to teach DBAs and developers the best strategy to transfer large data. 

We will first analyze how data gets accessed from the source and how data gets updated or inserted to the target server: index access patterns in read operation and minimal logging in wring operation. I will introduce TF610 and cover its benefit for minimal logging even in full recovery mode.
