## Title: Table Partitioning: Evaluation, Planning, Options
## Abstract:
### Does SQL Server's table partitioning feature offer performance improvements, manageability benefits, or both? Table partitioning is a significant investment: it's important to understand many aspects of the feature to evaluate where it will be useful. This session will cover basic concepts of table partitioning. We'll discuss where the feature can be applied, its benefits, and changes that partitioning may require to existing database schema. Special considerations for management of partitioned tables will be discussed, as well as potential changes to query optimization and plans. SQL Server 2008 R2 features for partitioning will be included in the discussion.
