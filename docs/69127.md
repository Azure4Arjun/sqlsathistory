## Title: Patterns for building hybrid scenarios with SQL Server and Azure
## Abstract:
### SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds. 

For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost. In this demo-heavy session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do with your SQL Server infrastructure. SQL Server and Azure are built for each other.
