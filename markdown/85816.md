## Speaker: Damian Widera
## Title: Data Science for everybody. Beware of what you are eating.
## Abstract:
### This is a session about practical approach to the data analysis. I do not know much about mushrooms but I know that some of them could be poisonous. But what about other mushrooms? Should I eat them or not? If you have the same doubts than you should attend the session. I would like to  show you the machine learning and neural networks approach in such type of problems. And then you will see how you can generalize the approach to other types of problems as well.
