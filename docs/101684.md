## Title: Your User Feedback - in 2 Hours or Less - Part 1: Making Entry Mobile
## Abstract:
### Our users are constantly generating valuable data that we, as the business, could leverage.  Unfortunately, capturing and analyzing this data has been a costly endeavor both from a development standpoint as well as being labor intensive from an entry point of view.  That is until now.

In part one of this two part session,  we will review a proof of concept involving the development of a PowerApps for data entry.
