## Title: What to Look for in Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### You've heard often enough that you need to look at execution plans to understand what's going on with a query. But what are you supposed to look at? This session answers that question, providing a step-by-step set of considerations for evaluating your execution plans. We'll look at the aspects of an execution plan that should be immediately checked, why they should be checked, and provide some guidance for what to do about what you find. You'll be able to apply this information to your SQL Server 2012 systems as well as older versions of SQL Server.
