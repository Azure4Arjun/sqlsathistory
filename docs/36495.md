## Title: Spinning Brown Donuts: Why Storage Still Counts.
## Abstract:
### Storage, next to server hardware, is pretty commoditized and probably the least exciting thing in your datacenter. However, not properly assessing your storage needs and requirements can be the difference between a great app or resume generating event.  This session will cover topics such as: Why you may not need all flash, SAN is not just NAS spelled backwards, Leveraging cloud storage, Why RAID is not a sound backup solution,  and cutting through the marketing to make sense of it all.
