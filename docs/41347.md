## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Understanding how SQL Server stores your data can seem like a daunting task. In this session You'll learn how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in a data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map and GAM and SGAM pages. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.
