## Speaker: Just Blindbaek
## Title: Reporting the reporting services database
## Abstract:
### Complete the loop and create reports on top of the Reporting Services database so you can answer questions like: Who is using the reports and who is not? Any reports not being used? What are the top 20 list of slowest reports? Who received the Data-Driven Subscription? What are the dependencies between data sources, data sets and reports? What is the specific query in a dataset or report? When was the report deployed and by who? Who has access to the reports and by which permissions?

The session will walk-through the creation and all the attendees will get all the reports from the demonstrations.
