## Speaker: Mark Stacey
## Title: Slowly changing dimensions- an integrated approach
## Abstract:
### There are many treatments of table design for slowly changing dimenions, and almost as many on doing ETL on an SCD. Much less has been said about building a cube around a slowly changing dimension.
In this session, Mark will review the types of slowly changing dimensions, describe the performance implications of various methods of loading SCDs in SSIS (SCD task, Lookups, Merge, and Script component), and build the versioning directly into the dimension in Analysis Services
