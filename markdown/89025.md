## Title: Azure Resource Management with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### You’re company is transitioning to the Cloud. Initially, your Azure deployment was small and could be managed primarily via the Azure portal but now it spans the globe with implementations in several countries. You have too many resources to manage with the Azure portal alone. You can automate these tasks with PowerShell without being a PowerShell expert. I’m Ronald Dameron. I’m responsible for managing the resources of twelve Azure subscriptions containing hundreds of resources. I can show you how. I’ve done it.
