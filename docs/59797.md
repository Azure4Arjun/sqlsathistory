## Title: Working with the  SQL Azure DB
## Abstract:
### Working with the  SQL Azure DB -PAAS can be done in many tools:
Azure Portal, SSMS, VS, PS.
Monitoring is also different from On-Premise SQL Server.
SQL Server Agent is missing in SQL Azure DB.
I will show how a DBA can and need to work in DB on the Cloud.
