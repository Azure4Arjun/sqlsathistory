## Title: Object Relational Mappers for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are a tool often praised by developers and despised by DBAs. I'll show that, like most tools, ORMs have their place if used responsibly. They can also get out of hand if they are trusted to always do the right thing. I will demonstrate usage of the most common ORMs for .NET and how each can go awry as well as how to monitor each for proper usage. This will not be a validation or admonishment of their usage; simply a look at their advantages and how to overcome some of their disadvantages.
