## Title: Things You Should Never Do In Microsoft SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this fun session we'll review a bunch of problem implementations that have been seen in the real world.  Most importantly we will look at why these implementations went horribly wrong so that we can learn from them and never repeat these mistakes again.
