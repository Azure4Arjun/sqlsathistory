## Title: In-Memory Technology in SQL 2016 (Columnstore Indexes and In-Memory Tables)
## Abstract:
### Some presentations cover the columnstore index and some cover in-memory optimized tables.   In this presentation, I'll cover both!   I'll demonstrate some actual examples of data warehouse, BI, and OLTP applications where the columnstore index and in-memory optimized tables in SQL 2016 can yield tremendous performance enhancements.
