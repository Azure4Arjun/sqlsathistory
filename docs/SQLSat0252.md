## Speaker: Brent McCracken
## Title: Using Event Notifications with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Event Notifications are a great tool often not used by DBA's. I will show you how this is a good introduction into the world of Service Broker and why it is better than triggers or SQL Trace. I will demo a practical use of auditing that we use in Kiwibank that you can take away and use yourself.

## Speaker: Dave Dustin
## Title: Microsoft SQL Server – Project Hekaton
## Abstract:
### The release of Hekaton, Microsoft’s In Memory OLTP enhancements for SLQ Server, promises to change the kind of high performance solutions that can be implemented using SQL Server. 
In this session we'll look at what Hekaton actually is, how it achieves the 10x-50x speed improvements on the same hardware and how architects and developers can start planning future application.

## Speaker: David Curlewis
## Title: Building to scale: Overcoming Performance Hurdles
## Abstract:
### In this session I'll be using a fictional auction website's database (which I've created for demonstration purposes) to take an accelerated look at what a typical web-scale database application's performance pain points might be as it grows, both in size and load.  We'll simulate some users, monitor some stuff, see what breaks, and then fix it. 

This will include some basic design and indexing best practices to kick things off - but we'll quickly move on to more interesting options for getting the most out of SQL Server under load.  Time allowing, I'll also do some demo's on the impact that SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP (i.e. Project Hekaton) tables have compared to our previous best efforts in 2012, and whether natively compiled stored procs will give us any additional zing as well!
