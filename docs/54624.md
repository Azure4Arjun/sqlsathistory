## Title: Making Database Development and Deployments Easier With SQL Server Data Too
## Abstract:
### Tooling for database development and deployment is often a cause for frustration. Developers don't like using Management Studio because it's an administrative tool that doesn't offer the full Visual Studio experience. DBAs want an automated, consistent, and reliable way to deploy changes without having to write custom scripts every time. Enter SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), a free set of tools from Microsoft that spans all phases of the database lifecycle from development to deployment while relieving both Developer and DBA pain along the way. In this introductory level session you'll learn what SSDT it, how it works, and how to implement it in your environment.
