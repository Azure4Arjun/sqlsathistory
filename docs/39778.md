## Title: Third-Party Application Deployment: Dispatches from the Trenches
## Abstract:
### Before you install that third-party solution in your SQL Server environment, come to this fireside chat.  John will spin tales from more than a decade of experience in application support to cover some of the more common, and more problematic gotchas you might encounter, as well as their workarounds and solutions. With luck, you'll leave with an improved pre-checklist for deploying purchased products, whether in Development or Production environments.
