## Title: Optimizing Temporal Queries
## Abstract:
### Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is the performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed lately. This high-level technical session introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals. Of course, these solutions can be implemented on other temporal problems as well. Actually, the test for overlapping intervals is one of the most complex temporal problems.
