## Title: You did what with PowerShell?!
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is cool. And powerful. Don’t believe me? See it for yourself. Come to this session, and I will show you cool things we can do with PowerShell – ranging from backing up your servers, working with BLOBs and XML, to automating SSRS report deployments and downloads, and even integrating with SSIS. We’ll work with different facets of SQL Server from a PowerShell perspective.
