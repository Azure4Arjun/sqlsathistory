## Title: SQL Server and ElasticSearch Integration
## Abstract:
### ElasticSearch is a No-SQL document store and search engine that scales up to very large data volumes and down to very small ones effectively.  Using ElasticSearch to do full-text searching makes a lot of sense.  This talk will introduce ElasticSearch and discuss strategies and practices for integrating it into a SQL Server environment.  Specifically discussed will be using queuing systems, LogStash and ETL paradigms to share data with ElasticSearch.  Considerations of deployment and operations will also be discussed.
