## Title: Delivering BI Solutions Rapidly using Vulcan
## Abstract:
### SQL Server, Integration Services, and Analysis Services are used together to deliver BI solutions but development efforts are carried out separately, without sharing of metadata between the products. This creates duplicate effort and compromises the ability to develop agile, iterative solutions.  Vulcan is an open source project from Microsoft (http://vulcan.codeplex.code) that helps bridge this gap, while also providing many of the benefits of code focused approaches used in application development. It allows you to define the relational data marts, ETL, and OLAP cube portions of your BI solution in a common language, and seamlessly uses that information to generate the appropriate database schemas, SSIS packages, and SSAS cubes.
