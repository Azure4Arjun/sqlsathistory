## Title: Introduction to DAX in Power BI
## Abstract:
### PowerPivotPro's Foundations curriculum is a crash course that has been crafted and refined over 10+ years to help Power BI and Power Pivot beginners to level-up their DAX skills quickly. This talk will be an introduction to Evaluation Context and the role it plays in how a DAX formula works under the hood, which is a critical concept for progressing beyond the limitations of drag-and-drop measures in Power BI and Excel Pivot Tables.
