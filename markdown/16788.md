## Title: Introduction to Kinect SDK - [en ingles]
## Abstract:
### During this session we'll explore the basics of Kinect Programming using the Kinect SDK.  This has nothing to do with SQL, but should offer a refreshing respitre from SSxS, SQL and other database stuff for any programmers attending.  Kinect SDK for Windows is an innovative new approach to Natural User Interfaces.  We'll explore how to trap and work with the various kinect sensors, such as camera, audio, depth, and skeletalk tracking you have.  After the session you'll understand the basics, and where to go next with your Kinect SDK development. [en ingles]
