## Title: Efficient Indexing Strategies
## Abstract:
### Indexes are incredibly powerful objects to optimize your database performance. However, when not implemented optimally, indexes can also have a negative impact on your queries! In this session we will take a close look at the different index types, how they work and how we can use that knowledge to design an efficient indexing strategy for your databases. We will also spend time analyzing existing indexes. Are those indexes being used? Can we combine indexes? Those are some of the questions you will learn to answer in this session.
