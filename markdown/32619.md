## Title: DBA Repository Update 2010 Using SSIS and SSRS
## Abstract:
### I put together the DBA Repository a few years back and have written and spoken about it for as many years with updates and enhancements over time. At it's heart, the solution employs SSIS and SSRS and in late 2009 I updated it for performance and resiliency. You can read about the original solution in SQL Server Magazine. The latest update will be published in 2010. This will be a sneak peak at those enhancements. The session will cover some interesting uses of package variables and MERGE in SSIS with new reports as well.
