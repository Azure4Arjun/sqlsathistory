## Title: Realizing the Power of Microsoft Reporting
## Abstract:
### Once youâ€™ve loaded your data into a star schema and built an Analysis Services 2008 R2 cube around it, you are ready to harness the power of multi-dimensional analysis. Then, what are your next steps? You need to decide how to create and display reports.  Should you go with Reporting Services, PowerView or another reporting tool? This session will explore and demonstrate the different reporting options for deriving business intelligence.
