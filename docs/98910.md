## Title: Query Store a gran escala: llegando a la milla extra
## Abstract:
### Query store feature was presented in SQL Server 2016 to provide insights on query performance and simplify troubleshooting.
This feature might be enough for small enterprise environments, but When managing hundreds of instances requiring top performance
and zero down-time - it requires going an extra mile.

In this session we'll present how at ChannelAdvisor we leverage the power of query store feature into a central store - proactively improving performance on an on-going basis.
