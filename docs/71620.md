## Title: Getting your DB schema under control with SSDT
## Abstract:
### Have you struggled with keeping track of all of the scripts needed to release the next version of your database? Have you ever had to scramble at the last minute due to bad database scripts? This session might help you get control of your database schema by using SQL Server Data Tools.

We'll cover:
* What exactly is SSDT?
* Getting your database into an SSDT project
* Putting that project into source control
* Making changes to the project through schema compares or direct changes
* Pushing those changes out to your servers

This session assumes basic knowledge of TSQL to create and manipulate database objects. Some understanding of Visual Studio, version control, and SQLCMD will help, but is not essential.
