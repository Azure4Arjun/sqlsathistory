## Title: Production is all Virtualized, Is Yours?
## Abstract:
### I don't know how the Sql Server will perform!  You can't do that! Yes, we can!  Yes, we did! It runs better than our physical server.  Need to add a CPU in less than 5 minutes, no problem. Need more memory, sure.  Give me 5 minutes.  Thin provisioning, thick provisioning? Can I put as many Sql Servers as I want on the Host?  What is a Host and a Guest? What is causing my Sql Server to run slow, is it the virtual, operating system or Sql Server? How do I know? What is the licensing for Sql Server? How do you monitor it? How is it working? Letâ€™s find all of these answers.
