## Title: NO-SQL For the DBA
## Abstract:
### In this session I will make a high level introduction of NO-SQL databases from the viewpoint of a Database Administrator. We will review some of the key benefits and challenges of the no-sql database concepts and understand how DBAs will become more involved in the day to day operations of such databases. While no-sql databases are designed for developers, important operations will fall in the hands of DBAs over time. We will look primarily at the Azure Table no-sql data store, and quickly tour other storage engines to understand how they differ such as DocumentDB, CoucheBase and more.
