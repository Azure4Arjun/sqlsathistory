Event Date: 26-09-2020 - Session time: 13:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Carlos Lopez
## Title: Getting started database development with WSL2
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will apply (WSL) Windows Subsystem on Linux to manage SQL  Server on Docker containers interfacing in your local environment.
We will take advantage of this new out-brake to maximize the use of resources and apply this scenario into the SQL Server world with the use of containers. We will manage a containerized SQL Server database and inspect through scripting capabilities between Linux and windows environments working together.

Overview SQL Server containers demos inside the image prepared as well as the configuration for it.
