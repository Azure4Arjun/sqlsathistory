## Title: Handcrafting Covering Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you have a need for speed but cannot change the code? Covering indexes might be your best friend. You might have heard about covering indexes, but what are they exactly and how do you design one? In this session, we explore what covering indexes are, why you might or might not need one, how to craft them, and how to test them for effectiveness. By the end of the session, you will be prepared to make effective indexing decisions while tuning individual queries.
