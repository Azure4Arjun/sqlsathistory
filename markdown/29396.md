## Title: Data Mining with Analysis Services 
## Abstract:
### Modern day computing power and SQL Server makes it possible to add sophisticated data mining models to our applications that forecast and predict, perform anomaly detection, and classify data. This presentation will demonstrate how to use Analysis Services to incorporate these complex algorithms seamlessly into your databases. Attendees will be shown how to create a data mining model using SSAS, how to use SSIS to query and load mining forecasts, and a sample web application that seamlessly uses a mining model. Take a step forward towards making BI pervasive in your organization by integrating data mining into your companyâ€™s applications...and learn how to win your fantasy football league and beat the stock market too!
