## Title: Make Your Maintenance Plans Better and Faster
## Abstract:
### Maintenance plans are never easy. They get worse as the databases get bigger and the maintenance windows shrink upon pressure from the customers. So, stop struggling with your nightly/weekly database maintenance plans. 
I am going share a case study of a three-terabyte database and how I tweaked my Indexing, backup and restore jobs to help cut down my maintenance window from over eight hours to under 30 minutes. By the end of my session you will be able to shrink the duration of your maintenance plans by as much as 75%. 
You will learn to use parameters like BLOCKSIZE, BUFFERCOUNT and MAXTRANSFERSIZE appropriately with the BACKUP command. You will also see the advantages of native database compression, striped, parallel and staggered backups in combination with a mix of Full/Differential and Log backups.
I will also show you how third party tools like Copy Data Virtualization or Snapshot Mirroring help us cut down our backup and restore times by as much as 95%.
