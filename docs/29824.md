## Title: Getting Spatial with SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### One of the great features of SQL Server 2008 is its native support for spatial data types. Spatial data represents information about the physical location and shape of geometric objects. These objects can be point locations or more complex objects such as countries, roads, or lakes. This session looks at how you can take advantage of this support for spatial data to enhance your location based applications in new and interesting ways. You will learn how to load and query spatial data in SQL Server as well as how to present the data in a Bing map.
