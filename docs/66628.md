## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Joe Celko - Data Encoding Schemes
## Abstract:
### Data doesn't go directly into a computer. It is usually encoded, but nobody takes time to classify and consider how to actually design these encodings. The goal of this talk is to give you those skills.

We'll begin by considering the basic types of encodings.

Enumeration Encoding
Measurement Encoding
Abbreviation Encoding
Hierarchical Encoding
Vector Encoding
Concatenation Encoding

The talk will then move on to the concepts of validation and verification, what makes a good encoding scheme, and where to look for industry standards.

Speaker: Joe Celko
Joe Celko served on the original ANSI X3H2 Database Standards committee and is the author the Joe Celko series of SQL books for Elsevier/MKP. These days, I do training and design evaluations.
