## Title: How to downgrade a database
## Abstract:
### You just can't simply move or restore a database to a SQL server with lower build version. Some would say that this is impossible! Well it's not!

In this session we'll discuss why would you need to downgrade a database and then I will demonstrate a few ways how it can be done for different levels of database complexity.
