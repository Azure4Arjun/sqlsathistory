## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
## Abstract:
### Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!
