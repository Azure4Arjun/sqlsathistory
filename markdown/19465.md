## Title: Optimizing DAX Analyzing Query Plans
## Abstract:
### Learn how to optimize DAX measures and queries in this very technical and deep-dive session. Starting from simple performance issues, you will see how to read and understand the query plan of a DAX query. With this information, you will be able to locate bottlenecks in calculation and improve performance by changing DAX expressions, moving the workload from the formula engine to the storage engine and get a complete understanding of the internals of the DAX query engine. A previous knowledge of the xVelocity In-Memory engine and some basics of the DAX Query Engine are suggested in order to follow this session in a more productive way.
