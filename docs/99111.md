## Title: Data scientists have left ... How will I deploy their work?
## Abstract:
### Description
That's it, data scientists have left the house! Behind them, some scripts written in Python or R, thousands of CSV files, three sheets and two whiteboards of mathematical equations, many PowerPoint presentations and a clear instruction from the CEO: go to production ASAP! Unfortunately, no trace of a deployment procedure. Hopefully, this session, will explain how to industrialize data scientists' scripts. How to import and refactor code written in Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code, How to put in place the best practices of DevOps and apply them to Machine Learning with Azure Pipelines and some other tips and tricks for a successful go-live.
