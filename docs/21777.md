## Title: SSIS for ETL in the Enterprise Environment
## Abstract:
### Design walkthrough of an ETL solution developed using the Microsoft SSIS system for an enterprise level Data Warehouse.  Managing the ETL process migration from a single data warehousing SQL Server to a multi-server environment can often be a complex task.  This session will walk you through the design of a ETL system that has been created for such a scenario.  The design takes into consideration several of the shortcomings inherent in the SSIS system and provides a structure for coordinated loading and processing of data from extraction to presentation.
