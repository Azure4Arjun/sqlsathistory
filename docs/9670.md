## Title: Executing SSIS Packages using SQL Server Agent
## Abstract:
### This presentation introduces SQL Server Agent job options that are avialable for packages that are deployed to the new SSIS 2012 server. I'll also review known solutions for troubleshooting packages that don't run when called from a job step, and show how to use the Log File Viewer and SSIS Catalog reports to troubleshoot.
