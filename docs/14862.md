## Title: SQL Server 2012 Memory Manager Changes
## Abstract:
### The SQLOS component is an internal user mode OS enrichment layer for SQL Server that delivers necessary system level services such as co-operative user mode scheduling, memory management, deadlock detection and exception handling to SQL Server components. One of the investments we made for SQL Server 2012 is to refactor the Memory Manager subcomponent in SQLOS to allow users to predictably size the SQL Server memory consumption in addition to performance  scalability improvements. Come learn about what this change means for sizing memory for workloads in SQL Server 2012. You will also hear about related DMV and performance counter changes for this improvement.
