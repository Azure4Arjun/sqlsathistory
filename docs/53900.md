## Speaker: Pawel Potasinski
## Title: (PL) Think Mobile! Mobile Reporting with Microsoft Data Platform
## Abstract:
### There are some business users wanting the information to be available at hand, wherever they are. A good example is a board member tracking profitability of his/her company on a favourite iPhone. Microsoft Data Platform allows BI developers to build reports and dashboards that can be delivered to the most popular mobile devices in the world (iPhone, iPad, Android devices, Windows devices). The purpose of this session will be to show up the capabilities (but also some caveats) of mobile reporting solutions built with SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services (ex-Datazen) and Power BI.
