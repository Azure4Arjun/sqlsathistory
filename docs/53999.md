## Title: Azure Search - full-text search in a cloud
## Abstract:
### During this session we will talk about Azure Search - full-text search engine provided to us via SaaS model. The main advantage of this service is not only that is fully managed by Microsoft, scalable, reliable and all other cloud related stuff. It is more about numerous data sources you can use to populate your search indexes. Also, because you use HTTP to work with Azure Search, you can easily use it not only within your desktop or web applications, but also you can easily consume it in your mobile applications, IoT solutions, etc.
