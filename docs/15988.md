## Title: Shredding XML in SQL Server
## Abstract:

It's there in client data feeds, files shipped from customers, and underneath the covers of SQL Server's own execution plans. The fact is, it's there, and you need query that data. In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery. By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to tear apart any XML like an old pro.
