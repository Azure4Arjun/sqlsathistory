## Title: Gain RANK in your queries with the ranking functio
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will explore the ranking functions that were part of the new feature set added with SQL 2005.  These allow the addition of a ranking column to your result sets that can be used to manipulate data sets without the need of the dreaded cursors.  We will explore Row_Number, Rank, Dense_Rank and NTile along with ways that they can greatly optimize queries.  We will also see the use of CTEâ€™s while demonstrating some of their uses.
