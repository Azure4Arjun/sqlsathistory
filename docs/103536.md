## Title: Introduction to Graph Databases in Azure Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### Azure Cosmos DB provides a fully managed graph database through the Gremlin API offering.  This allows us to build graph databases in the cloud that can elastically scale, are available in multiple regions across the globe and can provide fast query times on our data.

In this session, I'll cover the basics of what graph databases are and how these concepts apply in Cosmos DB. Then I'll discuss how we can model our graph data in Cosmos DB, how we can optimize the performance of our Graph databases in Cosmos DB and how we can build applications to interact with our Graph databases.

By the end of this session, you'll leave with an understanding of what Graph databases are, how we apply that knowledge to Cosmos DB and how we can build graph databases in Azure Cosmos DB
