## Speaker: Pat Sheehan
## Title: SQL Server 2014 In-Memory Architecture - Microsoft xVelocity Engine
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review the xVelocity engine enhancements for columnar data and In-Memory OLTP. •	For OLAP/DSS: provide an overview of columnstore –v- rowstore, learn how/when to apply columnstore indexes, demonstrate the radical improvement in columnstore can provide. There will be a demonstration where a DW system will be optimized using columnstore indexing.  •	For OLTP: describe the bottleneck inherent in OLTP operations, review a radical new approach to resolving the issue, and demonstrate the results. There will be a demonstration where an OLTP database will be converted to leverage SQL Server 2014’s new in-memory optimization. Benefits of attending: •	You will learn where columnstore indexes are best suited, and, just as importantly, scenarios where they are not suited •	You will learn how and why columnstore may provide orders of magnitude performance increase for your DW systems •	You will learn how to create columnstore indexes •	You will learn how to diagnose a specif
