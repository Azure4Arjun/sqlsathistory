## Speaker: Jay Robinson
## Title: Developer Nights: The Ballad of Bobby Tables
## Abstract:
### Hard skills have their place, but the key to successful software development is effective communication and collaboration. Join other developers and DBAs at the end of the day for a lively and informal discussion about how we work together to be successful. In between the jokes and war stories, gain insight into patterns and practices that empower software development teams. And... perhaps a few that don't.
