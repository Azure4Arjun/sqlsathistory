## Title: A Database Designer's Favorite Features in 2016: Security, Privac
## Abstract:
### The launch of SQL Server 2016 means there will be a lot of blog posts and webinars of people talking about all the great administration features that come with this new release.  Karen Lopez and Thomas LaRock will be sharing the best features from a database designers point of view -- from Always Encrypted to Zombie Datatypes.  

We'll look at the new features, why you should consider them, where they work, where they don't, who needs to be involved in using them, and what changes, if any, need to be made to applications or tools that you use with SQL Server.
