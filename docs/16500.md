## Title: Designing Stored Procedure Solutions
## Abstract:
### In this session, you’ll learn about SQL Server stored procedures (SPs): what they are, when and why you'd use them, and how you'd go about developing a solution with one.  We will address common SP myths and learn about planning for performance. Most of all, we’ll walk through examples to explore the process of solution building in SQL Server.
