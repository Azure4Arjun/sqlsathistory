## Title: 1, 2, 3, … 100. How to manage many SQL Servers the easy way?
## Abstract:
### Quote: “A good DBA is a lazy DBA”. When you have to manage a few SQL Servers, it’s not that hard to be a lazy DBA and to automate your day to day activities. But when you have to manage over 100 instances, it can become a tough job. Just imagine how you will deploy a new maintenance job on all your instances? Are you going to connect to each server one by one? Not really… Microsoft provides an enhanced set of multi-server management tools. The purpose of this sessions is to point out which SQL Server tools you can use for multi-server management. The session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what features can be helpful in your environment.
