## Title: Change Tracking: A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control
## Abstract:
### Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture. Change Tracking is now the red-headed stepchild, but in many cases may be the best solution for data ETL movement from an SQL Server OLTP database to a data warehouse or reporting database. This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos. It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos using TSQL only (no SSIS).  A variation of this implementation has run every 5 minutes with never a failure in over 7 years.  Come learn how you can adapt the supplied code to have near real-time in your data warehouse (or reporting database).
