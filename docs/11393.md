## Title: Service Broker in Action
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Service Broker is a messaging framework built into the SQL Server engine. It enables SQL Server to handle messaging between servers and applications with light setup and overhead. The flexibility of the framework enables Service Broker to queue event notifications, task execution requests or other messages while leveraging the strength of SQL Server transaction management, reliability and recoverability. In this session we will see how to set up Service Broker, discuss case studies where it has been implemented in industry, and step through a practical example implementing an audit log.
