## Title: SQL Service Brokers
## Abstract:
### This session will provide an overview of Service Brokers, which provides asynchronous messaging capabilities in the SQL Server environment. We will discuss when it is appropriate to use service brokers as well as how to create and manage them. During the session we will build a simple service broker implementation so we can see brokers in action.
