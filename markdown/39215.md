## Title: Big Data for the SQL Ninja
## Abstract:
### As more enterprises start implementing big data solutions, how does the DBA support these efforts and do they have the skills and knowledge to integrate big data solutions into your current architecture and processes? This demo-filled session has two purposes; first, to help DBAs understand how to apply their existing SQL Server skills in understanding and utilizing HDInsight and related technologies. Big data technologies don’t need to be intimidating, and this session will help DBAs see how they can easily apply their current skill when working with big data. Second, this session will show how SQL Server and HDInsight be used together to create solutions to solve big data problems without the complexities of massive learning curves and using technologies DBAs are already familiar with. We’ll look at technologies that make working with big data much less daunting, including HiveQL and Sqoop, both of which don’t require a rocket science degree to use.
