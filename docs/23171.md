## Title: Powershell Gems for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Over the last 5 years Powershell has become the “go to” tool for the automation and management of the Windows platform and SQL Server.
In this session we will walk through a number of Powershell functions, code snippets and techniques that can help fast track the development of automation and management DBA scripts. The examples in the session will show case Powershell building blocks like logging, exclude/include lists, read/validate INI files, retries, report generation, data load of performance data etc.
