## Title: Power BI Time Intelligence using a custom calendar
## Abstract:
### Power BI time intelligence (Month to Date, Year to Date, etc) functions work great when you use the normal natural calendar. But what happens when you have a custom calendar where the month does not begin and end on the first and last days respectively of a month. Learn how to use Power Query (M) and DAX to create the time intelligence fields and measures needed to solve this problem.
