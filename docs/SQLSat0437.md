# SQL Server Compression - Getting More Out of Less
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-437)
Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Michael Nowill
## Title: SQL Server Compression - Getting More Out of Less
## Abstract:
### We are storing more information then we ever have before and we need to retain this information for longer periods of time. Do we keep adding more and more disk space? What about performance? What about cost? Is there some way we can use the existing space more efficiently? With data compression we can tackle these issues and do it with minimal or even no changes to our existing code.

Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andrew Novick
## Title: 100 Times Faster: Experiences making SQL Server go fast
## Abstract:
### How do you go about making a program run a lot faster!  Like 100 times faster?   It’s difficult.  Microsoft tried in the Hekaton project, its in-memory tables feature of SQL 2014, and they got close.  Inspired by that effort, this presentation looks at some recent cases where I’ve been able to achieve huge performance improvements in SQL Server code and how that happens.

When I work on SQL Server performance I emphasize that the first thing to think about is how to accomplish the task in a different way that will be much faster”.   Sometimes there’s a better algorithm.  Sometimes a different technology is more appropriate.  Sometimes it’s a combination of many changes that combine to create the desired outcome much, much faster. 

This presentation is illustrated with examples from my work and we'll look for common threads that might help us all.

# Unleashing SSIS with expressions, configurable properties, and parameters
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-437)
Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Daniel Bowlin
## Title: Unleashing SSIS with expressions, configurable properties, and parameters
## Abstract:
###  Have you struggled to build SSIS packages?  You are starting to get the hang of it, but many things more than basic data movement remain a frustrating challenge.  The SSIS expression language is an incredible source of power within SSIS but a profound challenge to many.  Another area of power and flexibility in SSIS is its very broadly scoped configurability.  This presentation will walk through the basics of the SSIS expression language including the whys and wherefores of a few expression peculiarities.  Then we will review how you can use those expressions to configure so many of the properties in SSIS that you might barely recognize what your package can do when you are finished.  Finally we will review input parameters and how to further influence the behavior of your packages at run time.  Download includes slide deck, expression samples, and some packages.

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Introduction to Biml
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Leadership Without Borders: Working with Global Teams
## Abstract:
### As companies become more global, IT teams need to adapt. This often means having resources in locations outside our home countries as well as hiring outside parties for staff augmentation. As we place people in locations outside our own walls, processes and practices need to keep up with this shift. 

Whether your people are in Boston, Berlin, Bangalore, or Beijing, they all need to work together. We look at the challenges of having a globally diverse team, including collaboration, feedback, work assignments, and performance evaluations. We also look at outsourcing, offshoring, and a combination of the two. And we look at one of the greatest benefits: follow-the-sun support. 

In this session, we demonstrate how a language barrier isn't usually the biggest challenge and how cultural differences make the most impact.

Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 14:30:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Jack Corbett
## Title: Handling Data Error in a Data Flow
## Abstract:
### It can be frustrating to build an SSIS package with a data flow task and have data related errors where you can't identify the row or column that caused the error because of the cryptic or generic error messages presented to you by SSIS and the driver.  How do you find out what caused error?  Is there a way to get a better error message?  Can I identify the rows?  We'll go over a method I developed to handle error rows  using a script task (at one time upgraded to a custom component) so the offending data can be identified and corrected.  We will discuss ways to correct the problems in an automated fashion.  We will discuss other options in addition to my solution.
