## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Almost But Not Quite the Same
## Abstract:
### Let's talk about Managed Instance, the newest member of the Azure SQL Database family. It's a WHOLE lot closer to out-of-the-box SQL Server than other flavors of Azure SQL DB. But it's still got some differences. Do those matter for you?  What exactly is it? What is it good for (or not)? How much does it cost? Just how compatible is it with existing systems? How can I move data in and out of it? How is my data protected, for HA, DR, and backups? What else do I need to know about it?

Bottom line: Does Managed Instance make sense for me?
