## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: The DBA Career Roadmap
## Abstract:
### Nobody has a step-by-step plan for your career. But, you do need to know the general direction youâ€™re heading in; which roads go that way (and which ones dead end); and what might be worth stopping for along the way. For example, working for a small shop might be a dead end career move, or it could be a fantastic shortcut to somewhere you really want to be. Getting that next certification might be a worthy way to spend your time, or it might be running around in circles. 

Want to find out how to get to the next great place in your career? Get solid advice from the people who have already been there. If you want to be somewhere in five years, start moving today.
