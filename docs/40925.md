In this precon, we will be looking at the processes involved of taking a simple statement and forming a workable well performing execution plan.

Firstly, we will be looking at Execution plans themselves and picking them apart to describe the physical actions   that are executed by the engine to perform the required statement.  This will be followed by statistics, estimation and caching and the role that they play in forming and costing execution plans. We will see how SQL Server 2014 has new functionality and the problems that they are designed to resolve, we will finish with query optimizer internals.
