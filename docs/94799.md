## Title: Let it Flow:  Data Flows in Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure data factory has been the main tool for copying data from one source to another.  But it doesn't do a good job transforming the data, relying on tools like DataBricks, U-SQL or stored procedures for data transformation.  In May 2019, Microsoft made Azure Data Factory Data Flows available in public preview .  This tool, which in some ways is as powerful or more so than the SSIS equivalents makes it possible to edit the data as it comes from a source to a destination.  No more do you have to process the data to a file in order to change it in flight.
