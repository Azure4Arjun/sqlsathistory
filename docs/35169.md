# SQLSaturday #2 - Tampa 2008
Event Date: 16-02-2008 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 5
## Speaker: Jeffrey Garbus
## Title: Writing Determinate Functions
## Abstract:
### Determinate functions (also called characteristic functions) were originally used before SQL introduced the case statement. They allow you to make decisions mathematically, rather than with logic, which can make code dramatically faster. This session is not for people afraid of simple algebra.
