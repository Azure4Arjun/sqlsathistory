## Title: Adding Strategic Value By Leveraging Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Done right, SQL Business Intelligence solutions can provide tremendous value to executives tasked with strategic decision-making. We possess massive amounts of data. By filtering it and presenting it as information, and then through analysis creating intelligence, we are ultimately able to transform our work into fact-based strategy. Using real world examples, we will demonstrate a compelling case for how IT can leverage Business Intelligence to help the organization reach its goals, and in doing so elevate ITâ€™s own strategic role within the organization.
