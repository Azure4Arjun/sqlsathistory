## Title: Challenges to designing financial warehouses, lessons learnt
## Abstract:
### In todayâ€™s rapidly changing financial world, designing robust and durable data warehouses can be a challenge that does not always stand the test of time.
In this presentation, we shall look at some of the challenges and design issues that were encountered whilst designing two custom warehouses and the steps that were required to cope with ongoing requirement changes, indecision from management, and shrinking budgets; all of which affected the progress of moving these projects from the design board to a profitable production stage.
