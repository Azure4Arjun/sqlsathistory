## Speaker: Josh Fennessy
## Title: Little in the middle but got much [Write]Back
## Abstract:
### Often missing from many BI projects is the ability for users to quickly and effectively submit data BACK to the reporting system.  Luckily, when these reporting systems are built from a SSAS cube foundation, we have a potential answer.

Writeback is often an underused feature in SSAS cubes.  In this session, attendees will learn how to create their own writeback partitions, and create end user interfaces to submit data to them in Excel.  Also a deep-dive into the architecture of the writeback implementation in SSAS will be covered, as well as some limitations to the technology that are important to know before designing a solution.
