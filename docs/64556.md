## Title: HELP! HELP! My System Databases Are Gone!
## Abstract:
### Your worst nightmare has happened. You had a server crash and lost your system databases. Now what? Watch me break a Hyper-V virtual machine and then fix it again. This presentation will walk through regenerating and restoring your system databases to get back up and running. I will also discuss several situations I have faced and scenarios prepped for and strategies for preparing for the worst case DR situations.
