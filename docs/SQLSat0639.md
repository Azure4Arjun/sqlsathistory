# Columnstore Indexes with SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-639)
Event Date: 12-08-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Database Development  Administration
## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Columnstore Indexes with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### The columnstore index is the standard for storing and querying large data warehousing fact tables. It uses column-based data storage and query processing to achieve up to 10x query performance gains in your data warehouse over traditional row-oriented storage, and up to 10x data compression over the uncompressed data size. Beginning with SQL Server 2016, columnstore indexes enable operational analytics, the ability to run performant real-time analytics on a transactional workload. 

In this session, you will learn all about columnstore indexes and how to start taking advantage of this technology to achieve true real-time analytics.

## Title: Cloud Data Warehousing: Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### The heart of almost all Business Intelligence solutions; Relational Data Warehouse, has been servicing us for decades making the implementation is complete and success. It was always an On-Premises database, but now it is available as a Database-as-a-Service with Microsoft Azure, called Azure SQL Data Warehouse. It is a MPP cloud-based, scale-out relational database that supports workloads from few hundred gigabytes to petabytes of data and it addresses all modern requirements in data warehousing. Letâ€™s talk about traditional On-Premises data warehouse little bit and then discuss about Azure SQL Data Warehouse and implementation of it.
