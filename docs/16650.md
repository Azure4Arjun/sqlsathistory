## Speaker: Jessica Moss
## Title: Getting Reports on Your Schedule
## Abstract:
### Too often reports sent on a daily basis end up in a mail filter. Only a small percentage of the reports are actually necessary for someone to take action. How happy would your users be if you could only provide the report when they actually needed to look at it? You can, by using subscriptions and alerts in Reporting Services 2012. This session will provide a comparison of regular subscriptions, data-driven subscriptions, and data-driven alerts in Reporting Services 2012 in SharePoint Integrated mode. Attend this session to learn how to provide reports that will be read rather than filtered.
