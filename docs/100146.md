## Title: Production down!  How to keep calm and query on during an outage.
## Abstract:
### We've all been there.  Alerts firing, alarms going off, pages being sent.

It's 3AM, production is down and you're on call.  How do you approach an outage?

In this session, we'll cover methodologies for navigating outages, how to stay relaxed and keep a clear head, tips for identifying where things are bottlenecked and best practices for escalation and notification to customers and stakeholders.

This session will arm you with techniques to help you and your team efficiently triage, diagnose and resolve outages with cool and calm confidence.
