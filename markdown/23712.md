## Title: How Active Directory affects SQL Server
## Abstract:
### There are many things that can go wrong with SQL server, and a lot of times they come from outside influencers. Active Directory is one of the largest influencers that can have many interesting and unexpected issues that are not apparent. We'll discuss how the location of your server in AD is important, how security can be compromised, and even AD DNS configuration. By the end of the session you'll have a check list of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work. This includes the biggest perpetrator, Group Policies Objects.
