## Title: BI in Modern Excel: The value is in the Refresh
## Abstract:
### 2 text transaction files, a pivoted excel budget file, 20 Power Queries, 6 dimensional tables, and one interactive Excel dashboard = mind blowing awesomeness in under 60 minutes.  But while the analysis is important, the real value in the refresh.  Can your model pull in another 22 text files and next year's budgets in less than a minute?  This model can.
Come and see how Excel 2016 gives us the ability to not only rapidly create business intelligence, but also allows us to build engaging and interactive models that can be quickly updated and shared via Power BI.
