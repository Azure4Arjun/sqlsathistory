## Title: Moving applications to SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP
## Abstract:
### In-Memory OLTP aka Hekaton aka XTP is without a doubt one of the key features in brand new SQL Server 2014. By placing your data in memory and using native compile stored procedures you can boost and increase you SQL Server performance in times. But it is not so easy to implement as it may seem, you need to make a lot of changes in your code and even in your application architecture. In this session you'll learn what parts of your system can benefit by using In-Memory OLTP and what you should take into consideration before starting. As a bonus, I'll share my own experience of implementing In-Memory OLTP into a real production system.
