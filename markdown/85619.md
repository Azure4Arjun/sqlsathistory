## Title: Building Your Own Power BI Image Generating Measures
## Abstract:
### With the August 2018 version of Power BI, you can now write DAX measures that generate dynamic chart images using the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) standard. This means the long sought-after chart types of "small multiples" and "spark lines" are suddenly available, letting report authors create a sort of pivot table, not of numbers, but of dozens of tiny dynamic charts. However, this only works if you know how to leverage DAX to write dynamic SVG code, a rather oblique use of the language. In this session we'll be showing users how to do exactly that live on stage. We'll create several chart measures, from KPI indicators, to spark lines, to the game-changing bullet charts. Folks will walk away with some basic patterns they can use to create their own chart measures at home in no time at all.
