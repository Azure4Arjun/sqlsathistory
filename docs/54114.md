## Title: The 20% of DAX That Gets You 80% of the Way There
## Abstract:
### For those of us coming from a SQL background It's easy to get intimidated by DAX.  It's a weird language meant to appeal to Excel people while also mimicking much of the functionality of MDX.  This session will cover the topics that will make you productive immediately with DAX.  Those topics are 1) Calculated Columns v. Measures, 2) Implicit vs. Explicit Measures, 3) the CALCULATE function, 4) Time Intelligence,  5) CUBEVALUE.  This is truly the 20% of DAX that will make you productive in 80% of situations.  We're going to start with a working data model and start building calculations right away - bring your laptop.
