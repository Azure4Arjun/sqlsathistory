## Speaker: Kevan Riley
## Title: Uncovering the hidden gems in execution plans
## Abstract:
### We all know that the execution plan is central to understanding query performance, but the way we view the execution plan hides lots of good, useful information from us.   The plan is an XML document and knowing what attributes to look for can give you a better window onto your query's performance.  In this session Kevan will cover the attributes that he looks for, what they mean and what actions to take.  We may even get a sneak peak of what's to come in SQL 2014 too.
