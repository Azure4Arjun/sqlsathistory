## Title: Database design for mere developers 
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012: Efficient and effective database design is so important that leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns", final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.
