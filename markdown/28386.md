## Speaker: Aaron Nelson
## Title: PowerShell Awesomesauce
## Abstract:
### In this session we will begin exploring the amazing world of the PowerShell language.  We will compare cmdlets/operations to similar syntax/patterns in the T-SQL language.  We'll also step through one of the most talked about topics (the foreach-object command).  PowerShell has been bragged about since the beginning because of how much you can accomplish in just one line of code.  When you leave this session YOU will be bragging about what YOU can do in just ONE line of code!
