This session presents an view of how Docker containers work and how SQL Server runs in them. I  will cover  practical scenarios where with SQL Server and  containers how to deploy and configure a highly available SQL Server solution using Availability Groups on containers in a Kubernetes cluster as follows :

 ·         Using the Docker client
·         Exploring the Docker System

·         update a SQL Server Container
·         Multi-instance SQL Server using Containers
·         What’s New with SQL Server and Containers with 2019
·         Using SQL Server containers on windows
