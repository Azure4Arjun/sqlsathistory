## Title: Re-Introducing Power BI
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has brought business intelligence to the cloud. And it keeps changing! What does this mean and how does this work? In this session, we'll review the BI components available in Power BI. We'll also compare and contrast functionality of the Power BI tools with the functionality built into Excel, your current options for refreshing data in Power BI, and how to get real-time data into Power BI dashboards. After attending this session, you'll have a better understanding of what's possible and which tools best meet your requirements.
