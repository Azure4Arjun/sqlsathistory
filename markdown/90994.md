## Speaker: Joakim Nyström
## Title: Off-load data from production using Replication  Change Tracking
## Abstract:
### A common problem is to have too much old data in the production database, which affects administration and sometimes also performance of the production environment. 
SQL Server comes with many tools that, when properly used, can make your life a whole lot easier; some of which are: SQLCMD scripting, the Change Tracking system, Transactional Replication and the MERGE command.
In this session you will be presented to a simple toolkit that will utilize these tools to set up synchronization of your production data to an offline database in a way that is easy to configure and manage. The toolkit contains a very small number of T-SQL and SQLCMD scripts together with a “How to” instruction, AND it´s available in SQL Server Standard edition!
