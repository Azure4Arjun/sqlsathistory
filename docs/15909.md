## Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS
## Abstract:
### Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!
