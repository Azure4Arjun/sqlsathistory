## Title: Crazy Things That Developers Do, Part I
## Abstract:
### Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this 2 part session to learn what we do, why it's bad to the database server... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.
