## Title: Dirt, Spit, and Happy FLWOR: Hands on with XQuery.
## Abstract:
### Relational databases have become storage engines for more than just the traditional datatypes; the inclusion of XML in SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 opens up a host of new avenues for application development.  XQuery is a powerful language for querying XML fragments in conjunction with the relational engine; this session is designed to cover the basic FLWOR syntax of XQuery in an interactive fashion.  Participants are encouraged to discuss their own challenges with XML as well as seek out solutions from each other.
