## Title: Concurrency Controls and Isolation Levels in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server determines how multiple processes access the same data simultaneously based on the transaction isolation levels.  Because the locking strategy that the database utilizes to control access to data pages is different between the different isolation level settings, the effects on database performance will also be different.  The right isolation level must be chosen to achieve a good balance between data concurrency and performance.  In this session we will review the isolation level options in SQL Server, their effects on data locks, and performance considerations when running under each of the isolation level.
