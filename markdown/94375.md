## Speaker: Liz Amador
## Title: Women In Tech Panel
## Abstract:
### The greatest supporter of women are other women! Women are 18% of the professional field in data analytics. This is even less than the IT field as a whole. For those that identify as women, feel motivated seeing other women in this space share their journeys. For allies, take an opportunity to see and hear from women and other allies on how to support them.
