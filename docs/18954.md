## Title: NoSQL?!? No WAY!
## Abstract:
### NoSQL?!? No WAY!

Don't worry - the relational database still rules the data kingdom, but the world of data is moving beyond the confines of rows and columns and into a variety of types of systems.  

At the end of this session you will be able to dazzle your family and friends with your knowledge and application of the CAP theorem. We'll take a walk through the various types of NoSQL systems and discuss why you would use them.  You'll be armed with the right information to understand where document, columnar, key value, or hybrid solutions shine - and when you should avoid them.
