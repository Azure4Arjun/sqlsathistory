## Title: Advanced Data Recovery Techniques
## Abstract:
### Disasters happen â€“ plain and simple. When disaster strikes a database you're responsible for, and backups and repair fail, how can you salvage data, and possibly your company and your job? This is where advanced data recovery techniques come in. Using undocumented tools and deep knowledge of database structures, you can manually patch up the database enough to extract critical data. This demo-heavy session will show you never-seen-before methods I've used extensively in the last year to salvage data for real-life clients after catastrophic corruption. You won't believe what it's possible to do!
