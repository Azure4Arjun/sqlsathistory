## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Indexes, beyond the basics
## Abstract:
### Do you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but still aren't satisfied? Then this is the session for you! Learn about advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. Discover how they are stored on disk and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, see the tools SQL Server hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. Finally, get an stunning demonstration of just how badly you can hurt performance by creating too many indexes.
