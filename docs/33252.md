## Title: From DBA to Data Architect: Changing Your Game
## Abstract:
### The role of database administrator has been around for years, but as information collection and storage needs have skyrocketed, a new career opportunity has opened within enterprises: the data architect.  This session is intended to give some guidance on the differences between database administrators (and their cousins, the database developer) and data architects, including specific advice on how to transition from one role into the next.
