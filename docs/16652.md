## Title: Implementing CapTech's Data Management Framework
## Abstract:
### It can quickly become overwhelming to track all of your SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages for loading data.  Trying to figure out ‘what ran when’ and ‘who did what’ are tasks we've all had to face.  CapTech Consulting has successfully solved these common data management problems by implementing a data management framework for multiple organizations.  Come to this lunchtime session to learn how to implement your own SSIS framework and to never worry about your SSIS packages again!
