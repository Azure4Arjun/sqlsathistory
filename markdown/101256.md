## Title: Deploying Database Changes Without Taking an Outage
## Abstract:
### For most DBA's and most companies changes to the database are done during either a maintenance window that allows some downtime or during a full planned outage. Doing it that way makes a lot of sense, you don't have to work about blocking or deadlocks or the code being out of sync with the database. But what if your business needs to move faster, say deploying changes every week? It's possible, with some caveats and a small risk or two! This presentation will start an overview of "blue/green" deployments and why "database first" is a good plan. From there we'll look at how to deploy various types of changes and how to assess and mitigate the risk of each. It is possible, and the upside if that you'll work fewer nights and weekends making changes!
