## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: Spot the Potential Breakpoints in your Automated Process
## Abstract:
### We all have automated processes that were built in a rush and as long as everything is right, it works very well.  Then, several months later, after you have shoved the relevant knowledge about it to the corner of your brain, something happens that you didnt expect and the process fails.  You fix it, and it works again, but something else comes up and it breaks again.  This interactive presentation helps to show how to identify the potential break-points in a proces.  We will review 2 case scenarios: SFTP process which pulls files from a vendor and a log shipping process.  For each scenario, we will disect each part of the process and find out where the vulnerabilities are.

## Speaker: Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Going Asynchronous with Service Broker
## Abstract:
### Do you have complex operations that have already been tuned for optimum performance, but still run too long for a good end user application experience? If you do, Service Broker may be the solution. 

This session will explain the benefits of asynchronous processing in Service Broker compared to other options like SQL Agent jobs or SSIS packages, and how to implement the basic components required. Even in SQL Server 2014, Service Broker lacks a UI integration, which is sometimes a road block for implementations. Not to worry, this session will show you how to configure Service Broker correctly the first time so you can develop easy, foolproof deployments to solve complicated problems.

# Modern Concerns about Reporting Style with Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-699)
Event Date: 24-02-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Modern Concerns about Reporting Style with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers.  Reports combine tables with charts and KPIs and more.  Visually, there is a lot to be concerned with when designing your report to get the right information across to your audience.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation.  Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty.  It is about grabbing your audience's attention.  It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce ADA (American Disabilities Act) problems that will detract from your message if your audience cannot understand or interpret your data.  This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of ADA concerns to keep your data's message on track.

## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
## Abstract:
### We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

## Abstract:
### Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually is teach at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the exciting of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model have intrinsic limitations because of the false positives and false negatives. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reach, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all has reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.

## Abstract:
### Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or whether or not a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? The answer is baseline metrics.

Only if you have baseline performance information can you answer these questions and form a plan to address the issues at hand. In this session, we will be discussing several open source tools you can combine into an inexpensive baselining system you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions.

Attendees in this session will learn how to collect important metric data, what data to collect, and how to interpret that data and develop a plan of action to address any issues.

## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry
## Abstract:
### Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.

## Title: Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python
## Abstract:
### Six months ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.
