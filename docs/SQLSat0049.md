## Speaker: David Waugh
## Title: Response Time Analysis of SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues. Designed for the SQL Server DBA, Developer or anyone concerned with performance.

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#49---Orlando-2010)
Event Date: 16-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: TSQL
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

# Moving Data with SQL Azure and SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#49---Orlando-2010)
Event Date: 16-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS
## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Moving Data with SQL Azure and SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Azure allows you to host your data in SQL Server in the cloud. That provides some big benefits in scalability and management. However, it leaves open the question, “How do you get your data into / out of the cloud?” At some point, you are going to need to move data to or from an on-premise store to SQL Azure. In this session, we’ll discuss the available options for this, including SSIS, the Sync Framework, and BCP. We’ll cover the pros and cons for each. We’ll drill into one of the options, SSIS, in detail, and review performance options and potential issues that you may encounter when doing this.

# Transactional Replication: Beyond The Basics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#49---Orlando-2010)
Event Date: 16-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA2
## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Transactional Replication: Beyond The Basics
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication can support synchronizing from as few as a hundred to as many as hundreds of millions or more of changes a day across multiple servers. However, replication is more than clicking your way through wizards; Monitoring and tuning are required to achieve optimal performance and the number of processes involved increase the likelihood that problems can (and usually will) occur. This session is for DBA already familiar with the basics of transactional replication and looking to go beyond the setup wizards to gain a deeper understanding of the technology.  We'll cover monitoring techniques, calibrating performance, and troubleshooting common replication problems plus share some tricks and tips.

## Speaker: Ken Simmons
## Title: Automating Routine Maintenance
## Abstract:
### You have installed SQL Server in your environment, but now what? Unfortunately, far too many servers are neglected after SQL Server has been installed and the applications are up and running. In order to sustain a SQL Server instance that provides optimum performance, it requires constant maintenance. Luckily, you can use the same tools within SQL Server to automate maintenance tasks that you use to meet the business needs of the organization. This session will cover the tasks you need to perform in order to maintain a healthy instance of SQL Server as well as the tools you can use to automate them.

## Abstract:
### This session begins with a simple SQL database with several related tables.  It then shows how to import those tables to create a simp;le cube in Analysis Services.  Given a simple, but functional cube, the session then goes into Excel to use the cube in Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.  Finally, you will see how easy it is to publish those Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts into SharePoint using Excel Services to protect the calculation methods while allowing anyone with a browser to see and use your results.

## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: As a DBA, Where Do I Start?!
## Abstract:
### Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on its responsibility or joining a new company with previous experience, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority form. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also look at some of the available tools and scripts to help see where our environments rate. Mike emphasizes our role as "Protector of the Data" as a DBA throughout.

# Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS

## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS
## Abstract:
### The complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poorly planned and executed ETL project will inevitably lead to maintenance nightmares, low reliability of the system, or worse yet, to the failure of the project. 
In this session, we will use ETL best practices to make a requirements checklist you can use in your next ETL implementation, and will demonstrate  how you can use SSIS to implement and meet  such requirements. If  you already learned the basics about SSIS and now want to take your ETL solutions to the next level, or if you became an SSIS developer/architect by accident and wonder what do you need to succeed, then this is the right session for you.
