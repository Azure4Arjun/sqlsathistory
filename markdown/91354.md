## Speaker: Craig Porteous
## Title: Power BI and PowerShell - A Match Made in Heaven
## Abstract:
### Power BI is the shiny new tech for processing and visualizing data in the Microsoft Data Platform. However, the plumbing in the background does need managing (even if it is cloud-based and supposedly automagic).

In this session we will take a look at how to manage your datasets, security, monitor licensing and more, all through the ultimate administration interface: PowerShell!

You'll leave the session with an overview of the management capabilities of Power BI and couple that knowledge with the awesome power (and automation possibilities) of PowerShell
