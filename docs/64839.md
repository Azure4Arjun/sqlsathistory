## Title: Always On Multi-Site Patterns
## Abstract:
### Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.
