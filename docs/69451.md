## Speaker: Kamil Nowinski
## Title: Maintenance of a DB project and Continuous Delivery using SSDT
## Abstract:
### The task seems to be easy. Maintenance of a database project in the code repository, treat it as a master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex when the number of objects in the database grows. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
I will explain all these topics on the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.
