## Title: Speak your hands – using body language for effective presentations
## Abstract:
### Your body language can be a great asset to your presentation skills, and it can also be a good reason your presentation is relegated to the bottom of the scrap heap. Why is it that some speakers make you feel warm and fuzzy, like you instantly like them, while other speakers make you want to leave? Science tells us time and again that the nonverbal part of communication is a very important and significant, but still surprisingly few speakers – especially technical speakers – give it much thought.

 In this hour I go through several pointers for using your hands to convey and reinforce your message. I give ample examples of both good and bad body language and show you several tips and tricks to seriously enhance your stage presence.  Attend this session to learn about how body language can make sure you convey what you think you do!
