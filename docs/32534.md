## Title: Building PowerPivot Models and Reports
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will use the features of the PowerPivot add-in for Excel to import data from various sources, cleanse and prepare the data for analysis and finally use the data to build complex reports and publish. We will also take a look at Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) and how to use them to extend the functionality of the model and the reports.
