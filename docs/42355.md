## Title: Lightning talk - Live Query Statistics
## Abstract:
### Live Query Statistics is a new feature(ish) introduced in SQL Server 2016. In this lightning talk I will demonstrate the Live Query Statistics extracted from my DBA life made easier with 2016, Query Store and LQS. LQS will help in troubleshooting long running queries to pin point the pain points in the query execution even before the query completes the execution.
