## Title: SQL Server Spatial Data
## Abstract:
### This presentation will provide an introduction to the spatial data capabilities that were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  We will examine the spatial data types and indexes.  Then we will look at how to work with these data types, including loading data, querying spatial data, and generating reports with spatial data.  We will also discuss interacting with spatial data types from a .Net application.
