## Title: High-Availability and DR Options for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A comparison of SQL HA  DR options, by a practitioner who has implemented  managed all the SQL HA and DR approaches ( various combinations thereof). Tim is an operational SQL DBA, who keeps SQL servers up  running  optimized for managed-services customers. We will compare trade-offs between the various SQL HA  DR options: for complexity, usability, hardware, licensing, failover speed, initial costs, ongoing support costs, staff skill requirements, etc. And weâ€™ll briefly cover some of the upcoming SQL Denali HA / DR features.
