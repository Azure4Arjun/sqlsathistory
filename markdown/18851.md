## Title: Performance-Tuning for Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) Operations
## Abstract:
### Much has been written about performance tuning transactional systems and reports, but what about those huge queries used to populate your data warehouse, data marts or large data extracts? What good are reports if you can’t deliver the underlying data in a timely manner? What can be done to make handling millions of rows at a time go faster? In this talk, we’ll go over how to architect an ETL solution that will use every trick in the SQL-Server engine to make data move faster! We’ll be focusing on T-SQL based ETL stored procedures (and a little SSIS) rather than expensive tool-based ETL. We’ll also discuss hardware issues and how to tune processes that you can’t “change”.
