## Title: Temporal Data Capture
## Abstract:
### Come see how I solved that lack of CDC in SQL Azure Database by leveraging a new feature in SQL Azure database and SQL Server 2016: Temporal tables. In this in-depth 400-level session I will demonstrate the techniques that I created to simulate CDC in SQL Azure Database. We will examine the code that implements the solution, the code that automatically writes code for you, and a wizard that makes it simple to consume.
