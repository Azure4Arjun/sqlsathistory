## Title: harnessing the GPU power for Big Data Analytic 
## Abstract:
### Today modern graphics cards have a lot of computing power for example the Nvida flagship card Tesla K40 has 2880 cores and is able to peform 4.29 T operations per second !!.
In this  lecture I will represent the principles of developing for applications for GPU and I'll  discuses the advantages and the limitation  of using the GPU (graphic process unit) on big databases . 
I'll presents some interesting benchmarks we've  done on a GPU database vs RDBMS and columanr database and we'll try to predict the future in the area.
