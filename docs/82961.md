## Title: PowerShell for BI Pros: Automating SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, and Power BI
## Abstract:
### PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and automation. Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.
This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases. We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a minimum of effort. In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets  their integrations with SSRS, SSIS, SSAS, and Power BI. 
By the end of the session, you'll be able to accomplish in minutes what would normally take hours or days. Youâ€™ll know ways to quickly migrate and deploy hundreds of reports to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS dimensions. Additionally, you will also solve some pesky ETL tasks: deploying large-scale SSIS solutions, updating parameters for existing packages and streamlining data imports for Power BI Report Server
