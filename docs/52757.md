## Title: SQL Server Replication - What, How and Why [EN]
## Abstract:
### In an AlwaysOn world we focus on entire databases being highly available. However, replication offers another, arguably more powerful, way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" High Availability scenarios. 

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication. You will leave the session with an understanding of how you can leverage this feature to achieve solutions that are not possible using other High Availability features. 

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.
