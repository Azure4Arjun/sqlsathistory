## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Letâs see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Speaker: Juan Soto
## Title: Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?
## Abstract:
### Learn how to launch your career as a consultant, from how to get leads to call you, how to close the sale and what to charge for your services. A must see session if youâre ready to make the plunge!
Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).
I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
I will share how I close $25,000 deals over the phone, how to get your lead to say yes and how to overcome price objections. 
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life.

# Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#734-Dallas-2018)
Event Date: 19-05-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
## Abstract:
### Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

# Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#734-Dallas-2018)
Event Date: 19-05-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?
## Abstract:
### Could your seemingly-normal SSIS package be hiding a disaster, waiting to detonate at the most inconvenient time? Integration Services is an incredibly flexible product, and that flexibility can lead to good - and occasionally bad - design patterns. Small and seemingly trivial design decisions can lead to big issues down the road, including leaky data flows, data quality issues, paralyzing performance issues, and other explosive behaviors.

In this session, we will explore some of the most common SSIS design patterns that are potentially more harmful than they first appear. From package configuration to control flow constraints, and data flow transformations to logging, we'll demonstrate what can go wrong and show some alternative designs to prevent these types of problems from developing into bigger issues.

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Introduction to Biml
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

## Title: Beginning Admin: The Care and Feeding of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Design and development may be exciting, but database administration is absolutely critical (and, reasonably well-paying!) The care and feeding of a server tends to get short-changed or neglected.  In this class, we'll cover the basics of the big five administrator tasks:

* Backups â You must set up regular backups, to keep copies of your databases...just in case something breaks, or someone makes a bad, bad mistake.
* Integrity checks â Regularly and automatically check databases for corruption, which is when bits get scrambled, lost, and ruined.
* Index maintenance â Databases need regular upkeep so they'll continue to run well.
* Disk management â It's actually your job to find out about full disks before they happen. After all, databases grow!
* Alerting â Alerts tell you what's wrong, so you don't have to go looking for problems.

Being a database administrator is a big job, but we can cover the basics in one session!

## Title: That's bad mkay!
## Abstract:
### We've all heard that things like nested views, cursors, and under/over-indexed tables are bad...but why?  What is the real cost of the badness that abounds in the database world?  What's really going on when you run that query against a view of a view of a view.  How can you quantify what happens when that cursor ends up running the same simple query thousands of times.  And how can indexes really impact the way SQL Server decides to solve your queries.  In this session we'll talk about the basics of how to read query plans and use extended events to understand why all these things can be big resource drains on a SQL Server.  Good times should be had by all.

## Title: The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality
## Abstract:
### How would you like to learn about using Virtual Reality (VR) to present information? The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of data and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. VR can provide a way for people to see relationships and interact among data sets which can be difficult for computers to display visually on a flat screen.

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using Epic Games video game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). With native support for VR, UE4 has been used for applications beyond just video games. With the commercial availability of affordable VR headsets, data professionals can now create visually compelling environments that were almost impossible or extremely expensive just a few years ago on both PC and mobile devices.
