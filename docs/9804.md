## Title: Strategies for Sharding with SQL Azure Federations
## Abstract:
### Putting big data in the cloud is not without its difficulties and the Microsoft Azure teams have been consistently upping the resource limits that you are able to utilize within a given instance. Those of us with larger capacity instances still have to hedge our bets when looking at moving to the cloud. That is until the recent release of SQL Azure Federations, which offers a native SQL Azure based option to possible unlimited scalability. In this session, we will break down the basics of sharding within SQL Azure Federations, explain what needs to be taken into consideration in terms of database design, and put you on the right path to a successful Federation based deployment.
