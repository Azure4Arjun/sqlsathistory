# SQL 2012 Table Compression
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#227---Charleston-2013)
Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

# “Indexing” Encrypted Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#227---Charleston-2013)
Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: “Indexing” Encrypted Data
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

# 10 Things all BI System Administrators Should Know

## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: 10 Things all BI System Administrators Should Know
## Abstract:
### Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator?

Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.

### Data is beautiful…or at least it can be….This session dives into the art  science behind data visualization. We will start by looking at the research done by Stephen Few and Edward Tufte to practically understand questions such as why you should prefer a bar chart over a line chart and why you typically should avoid pie charts whenever possible. Next, we will look at why Reporting Services is a rich  powerful platform for delivering your visualization before wrapping-up with techniques for implementing and delivering your eye-popping data visualizations.

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Database Health and Performance
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that sick servers generally do not perform well. But, how well are your servers running? Let’s perform a health and performance check! In this session, we will perform a holistic system health and performance analysis where we dive through common tasks that you should routinely perform. Once the health and performance analysis is completed, a remediation plan is developed. Baselines are established and updated. Coming out of this session, you will have a tried and true methodology for examining your system state, checking for unhealthy components, analyzing performance, and keeping things that way for years to come.

## Title: Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros
## Abstract:
### Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."
