## Speaker: Ronald Dameron
## Title: Sysadmin not always required...
## Abstract:
### I'll describe how I've used the Separation of Duties Framework and a Privileged Identity Management suite to minimize the permissions needed by DBAs to do routine work.  I'll review the Separation of Duties Framework and the process I took to arrive at a workable solution that will give DBAs the access they need to maintain the server but not be able to view user data.
