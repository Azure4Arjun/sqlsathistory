## Title: Devops for Data Science
## Abstract:
### In this presentation we will examine practices that combine and automate the processes between data science and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release models faster and more reliably.  We will examine the Data Science Devops technology landscape, and demonstrate how Kubeflow can be used to achieve end to end Devops for Data Science.
