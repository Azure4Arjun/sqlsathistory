## Speaker: Ronald Dameron
## Title: Cure your sysadmin addiction
## Abstract:
### Learn how to use the Separation of Duties Framework and a Privileged Identity Management suite to minimize the permissions needed by DBAs to do routine work. I'll review the Separation of Duties Framework and an easy to implement, low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain the server but not be able to view user data.  I will prove that sysadmin is not always required more often than most DBAs think. Also, attendees will learn how to define a permission set with a single script that allows your companyâ€™s DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies.
