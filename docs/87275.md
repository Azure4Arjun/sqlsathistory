## Title: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence with ONNX
## Abstract:
### WinML enables the execution of pre-trained machine learning models in Windows 10 devices. By leveraging WinML, devices would be able to perform local computations without dependencies on centralized cloud services which should play a role streamline the implementation of intelligent edge computing applications. The magic of WinML is based on another super cool AI initiative that Microsoft has been working on: The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is a project created by Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook to define a computational graph model that can be used across different deep learning frameworks. Technologies such as Tensorflow, Keras, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or Caffe2 have been developing support for ONNX.
