## Title: The Accidental Programmer
## Abstract:
### Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who out of nowhere get thrown into working with databases. Well what about the other side of the coin? What about those DB Developers and DBA's who have to write code? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. It covers optimizing your code to reduce database requests, standard object oriented concepts such as data abstraction and encapsulation, tier architecture, security, and translating SQL data result sets into strongly typed class objects in .Net.
