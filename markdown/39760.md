## Speaker: Carlos L Chacon
## Title: The TSQL Review for the Busy Data Professional
## Abstract:
### How does the way I write my query affect the way data gets returned to me?  If I use an inner join here, how does that affect my results?  This session will review some of the ways we write queries and how these decisions affect us.  We will also review database design concepts and how our architecture can influence our ability to make data available to users.
