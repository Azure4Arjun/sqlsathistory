## Title: Keeping your SQL Code safe â€“ An introduction to GIT and SSDT for DB professionals
## Abstract:
### Imagine that you have been hard working in that amazing project, your SQL code has been tuned and contains new features and followed the standard that will be crucial for the success of this project. The deploy date has arrived and you have deployed early in the morning but some minutes after the deploy, the users started to call for reporting several issues in the different systems which are using the Databases that were part of your deployment, after stressful minutes, you realized some SQL code deployed were not the same that were tested and you must rollback your code. 

In this session, I'm going to show you how to avoid problems derived of mistakes during the development process through the proper use of source control code strategy which can combine the potential of GIT and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for managing latest version, detecting changes, code review and deploying through environment without stress.
