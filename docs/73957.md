## Title: Solving Common DBA Problems With R
## Abstract:
### External script languages were introduced to SQL Server in 2016, starting with R and continuing with Python in SQL 2017.  To familiarize myself, I attended various community sessions, but each one was about statistics, anomaly detection, or forecasting.  That's all interesting, but itâ€™s not my thing, so we won't be talking about any of that!  This is a demo rich session about things you didn't know you could do from SQL Server with the help of R, such as parse JSON or convert to CSV, integrate Azure Key Vault for securely storing passwords, get documents from Azure Cosmos DB and add them to your data warehouse, archive tables across platforms, quick and simple ETL, and finding out easily which column of data is causing that "String or Binary data will be truncated" error.  Come join me for some eye opening demos about the many practical uses of R for non-statisticians!
