## Title: Get TurnedOn with AlwaysOn
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, there were 2 SQL Solutions named High Availability and Disaster Recovery. They had a love hate relationship and could never find a common ground. That is, until SQL Server 2012 brought them together in a love story built for the ages. When the dust settled, a beautiful new feature was born. It was called AlwaysON and brought with it new technologies like availability groups, read-only mirrors and listeners. It was a perfect blend of both HA and DR all wrapped up in one bundle of joy. 
SQL Server AlwaysOn provides a high-availability and Disaster-recovery solution for SQL Server 2012. Come see and learn some of the new features associated with it, how they work and why this new feature of SQL Server 2012 is so wonderful.
