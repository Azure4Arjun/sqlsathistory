## Title: AI and (Power) BI - Better Together
## Abstract:
### Power BI is on the market for a while now. It's seems to be a mature BI platform, but still does not utilize the potential of AI to support business decisions. However, in the last few months Microsoft announced many new Power BI features related to AI which can change the way people will work with this technology in the future. The purpose of this demo-intensive session is to show the AI-based capabilities of Power BI in use.
