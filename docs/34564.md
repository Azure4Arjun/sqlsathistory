## Title: How to write professional Powershell scripts
## Abstract:
### You probably have a few Powershell scripts sitting around, perhaps written from scratch but most likely you borrowed the idea from a blog somewhere, and then used those as templates to achieve your goal. It's time to take those ad-hoc scripts turn them into your very own module. And while we're at it we might as well add proper error handling, parameterization and pipeline support. I will also demonstrate how to build help, force and whatif support.
This is a demo rich session and all demos will be covering practical SQL Server related solutions.
