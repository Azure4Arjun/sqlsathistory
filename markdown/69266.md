## Title: SQL Server Availability Groups Configuration, Maintenance and Troubleshooting [EN]
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Availability Group is a still newest HA feature available in SQL Server, even it’s (highly) available from SQL Server 2012. After you successfully configure and deploy your first AG, you will need to further monitor and maintain AG to ensure that your environment stays highly available after deployment in production. Also, troubleshooting is a part of every DBA’s real life and  we will not even avoid this part. In this session, besides looking on the AG newest features in SQL Server 2016/2017, we will address most common scenarios of administration, monitoring and troubleshooting of Availability Groups.
This session is useful for DBA’s that are using or considering Availability Groups for high availability in SQL Server 2016/2017.
