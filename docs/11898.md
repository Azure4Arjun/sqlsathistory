## Title: Master Data Service in Practice: An Integrated Approach
## Abstract:
### Businesses depend on reliable, consistent and correct data that can be managed effectively and shared through-out the enterprise. Master Data Services provides a powerful, feature-rich platform for arriving at this destination but the successful journey to this end requires a proven integrated approach. This session will discuss how MDS fits in the overall EIM architecture within your customer's organization including real-world strategies for integrating (cleansing, matching and loading) Master Data into MDS and for making it available organization-wide.
