## Title: Insider Secrets to Securing the Budget You Need
## Abstract:
### How many times has a lack of budget for hardware, training, or expert assistance caused problems for you in designing, implementing, and maintaining a great SQL Server environment?  Come to this session to learn effective ways to secure the budget you need instead of being consistently required to do more with less, or worse â€“ nothing.  The good news is that there are several simple and practical things you can do to vastly improve your ability to get the budget you need when you need it.  You will hear how to think like an executive from someone who was one for many years so you can begin to influence decisions at the right level to get what both you and your SQL Server infrastructure need.
