## Title: Introduction to MDX
## Abstract:
### If you want to get the most out of your Analysis Services cube itâ€™s essential to know and understand MDX: you need to be able to write MDX queries and calculations. MDX is part of the underlying foundation for the SSAS (OLAP architecture), and it offers detailed and efficient navigation and drill across of multidimensional data. MDX is designed to ease the process of accessing data from multiple dimensions
This session aimed at those with little or no previous MDX experience will teach you the basic concepts of the language as well as show you how to write common queries and calculations.
