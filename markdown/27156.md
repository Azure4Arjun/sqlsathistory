## Title: How to Partition Anything!
## Abstract:
### Are you struggling with lots of data and really large tables? Have you heard of SQL Server Partitioning? Have you tried to figure out how you could add it to your database only to get lost in choosing the all-important Partition Key? Have you been told you canâ€™t do that or had problems trying to figure out how you could use Partitioning on an OLTP database because the search criteria doesn't fit the Partition Key mold of a date Partition Key in the data warehouse examples that you may have seen. In this session I will describe a way that you can use partitioning on just about any table in any type of database. This system of Partitioning can not only bring query times down but it can also speed up the insert times on very large tables. Please come and let me provide you some useful information that you can immediately implement on your very large problem tables in your database and see immediate results.
