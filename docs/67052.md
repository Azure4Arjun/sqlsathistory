## Title: SQL Server Data Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Data partitioning allows for the efficient loading, storage, retrieval, and shedding of data in an RDBMS platform. This session will focus on its use in MS SQL Server and how table partitioning can improve performance, manageability, and decrease concerns over concurrency. Especially if you are working with a data warehouse, you want to be sure to understand these concepts and how/when you might leverage them.
