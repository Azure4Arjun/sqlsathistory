## Title: Much Ado About Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Hadoop is a hot topic right now, and Microsoft is betting that Hadoop and SQL Server will go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  This presentation will spend a little bit of time on the theory behind Hadoop, but the rest will be a demo-driven look at how to get a handle on Hadoop before somebody introduces it into your enterprise.
