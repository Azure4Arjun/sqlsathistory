## Abstract:
### Title: Website Analysis Using PowerBI and App Insights:  Easier than you think

Description:  Recently, my company decided to turn on application insights.  I was tasked with learning the data model, extracting meaningful data, and providing marketing any information that could increase revenue.  The query language used in App Insights is SQL-like, and analyzing large amounts of data was easier than I expected.  So, if you have an Azure subscription, a web site, and executives telling you that they don't have enough visibility into web metrics, please attend.  During this talk after a brief overview of what App Insights does, I will demo how to run basic to intermediate queries against application insights data, and how to include that in a PowerBI report. 
 You will come away with ideas that can be quickly implemented that will make you immensely popular with the upper management.  This talk will be appropriate for DBAs and BI Developers alike.
