## Title: Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs
## Abstract:
### Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? I know I am, so I'm doing something about it...I'm automating my installs! From base SQL Server installs to Service Packs, Cumulative Updates and even Client Tools for DBA's and Developers, I'll show you ways to automate your installs using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project). Automating your installs doesn't just save you time, it improves standardization and adherence to best practices. There are multiple ways to automate your installs, but FineBuild goes above and beyond by allowing you to automate every part of the install from file locations to clusters, service accounts to custom databases, Reporting Services, Integration Services, Master Data Services, configurations and settings as well as many common 3rd party tools and more.  We'll cover many of the scenarios you may encounter and you'll walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.
