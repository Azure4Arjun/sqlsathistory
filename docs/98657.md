## Title: What I Wish Developers Knew About SQL Server
## Abstract:
### As a consultant, I visit many companies that are having performance of configuration problems with SQL Server. This session describes some of the most common problems I see from clients and explains how to avoid them. I cover reading query plans, SQL Profiler, indexing, correlated sub-queries, temporary tables, and user-defined functions, error handling and transactions and show how you can use them together to improve performance.
