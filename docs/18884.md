## Title: Performance Tuning your SSIS packages
## Abstract:
### In this session, you will learn valuable techniques on how to performance tune your SSIS packages.  As many of you know, creating ETL to carry out a specific task is one thing, but optimizing that ETL to run in an acceptable amount of time is a whole different animal.  You will learn about methods and properties that aren’t really mentioned in your introductory or even mid-level SSIS courses, as well as some unconventional tricks that I’ve picked up along the way.  To get the most out of this session, you will need to have previous knowledge and experience with SQL Server Integration Services (Not an intro session).
