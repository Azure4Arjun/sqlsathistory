## Speaker: Jared Karney
## Title: What is causing my database to grow?
## Abstract:
### Have you ever received a call that an application is throwing errors about the database being out of space? This session will help you learn how to proactively deal with those calls! Sometimes it isnâ€™t practical to limit the growth of our databases.  As DBAs, it is our responsibility to make sure that we know the disk space that is used and free, the size of our databases, when they grew, and why they grew so that we can prepare for it or reduce it. We can also track the size and growth over time to be able to predict future trends. In this beginner session, Jared Karney will show you how you can track the size of your disks, databases, and database files using DMVs. He will show you how to structure tables and indexes for storing this data, demonstrate the Extended Events to track when a data or log file grows and what caused the growth to occur, and how you can automate the whole process using SQL Agent.
