## Title: Mysteries of Data Masking Revealed -  in Azure, SQL Server, and beyond.
## Abstract:
### Data Masking, or Data De-identification, is a technique allowing a database practitioner to hide data with "false" values. Done in  response to the compliance regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, PCI and other, it allows securing data in variable ways based on the user role in the organization. Data Masking is not encryption! The strategies and algorithms would differ whether you need to use it in production or non-production environment and whether you need to apply it enterprise -wide or in separate applications. Learn about data masking as a part of privacy - by -design strategy and how to decide what to use and where.
