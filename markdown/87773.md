## Title: Tips, Tricks and Secrets for the SQL Professional
## Abstract:
### Ever heard the term, "work smarter, not harder". A mantra to live by in my book. Over the years, I have seen, forgotten, seen again and forgotten again all of the shortcuts, tips and tricks we all take for granted. SO like a good DBA, I started to document and share all of these commands and shortcuts to share. Come see and learn many of the everyday shortcuts in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) that will help make your life easier on a daily basis.
