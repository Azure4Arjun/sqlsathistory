## Title: Data Partitioning for Database Architects and Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Data partitioning is a valuable technique that simplifies database administration tasks and helps meet availability and performance SLAs. In this session, Dmitri will cover several techniques and architectural approaches you can use to partition data in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. You will learn about partitioned tables, partitioned views and stretch databases introduced in SQL Server 2016. Finally, Dmitri will discuss the practical questions, such as how to move data between filegroups and disk arrays keeping tables online, implement sliding window data purge pattern and benefit from partitioning in the systems with mixed (OLTP/DW) workloads.
