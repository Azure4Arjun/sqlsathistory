## Speaker: Dave Turpin
## Title: De-mystifying Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### Too often the query plan, or how the SQL Server engine actually implements the logical query, is ignored by developers and DBAs.  The reason for not trying to dive into the meaning behind the hyro-glyphic plan is simple: It's not easy to understand what all those icons mean in isolation, never mind as a collection.

This session will bridge the gap between the theory of internals, where the details are mentioned but not demonstrated, and the logical query.  A series of actual query examples will show how queries are treated by the optimizer and why; what to do to identify slow performing queries, and how to make simple adjustments to allow the query to perform significantly better.
