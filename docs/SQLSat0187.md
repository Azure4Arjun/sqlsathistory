Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: A DBAs Guide to HIPAA
## Abstract:
### In this hour long session We'll delve into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what implications it has for us as data professionals.  We'll discuss SQL Server best practices that can help protect ourselves, our company, and the people whom we serve.
We'll also dive into several features in SQL Server that can help in this endeavor.

# Writing faster queries
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Dev
## Speaker: Tim Chapman
## Title: Writing faster queries
## Abstract:
### Poor database performance is Achilles' heel of any system. Better and faster hardware can improve systems to a certain point. However, for truly great performing systems, there is no substitute for properly written queries and designed indexes. In this session we'll take a look at some common query performance killers, along with some no so obvious things that we can do to our queries to make them as fast as possible.

# SQL Server Index Internals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Tim Chapman
## Title: SQL Server Index Internals
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what an index actually looks like and performs under the covers?  In this talk I'll discuss Index Internals, and how SQL Server creates, maintains, and uses indexes internally for normal operations.  I’ll be discussing topics such as index data structures, query optimization (briefly) and maintaining indexes and statistics.

# How Flash-Optimized Storage Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage For Virtualized Environments
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Professional Development / Misc
## Speaker: Nimble Storage
## Title: How Flash-Optimized Storage Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage For Virtualized Environments
## Abstract:
### This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.  But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures designed from the ground up to leverage the best characteristics of flash and disk. Will these new solutions be able to simultaneously deliver high performance and high capacity primary storage? And can they improve data protection, improving recovery point and recovery time objectives with far less cost and complexity? Learn the answer and examine real-world case studies in this informative session.

# Intro to Common Table Expressions
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Geoff Johnson
## Title: Intro to Common Table Expressions
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTEs) serve two main functions: first they remove the clutter of subqueries out of the FROM clause while simultaneously making them easy to reference multiple times by alias if need be, and second they make it possible to do recursive queries. Learn the basics of using CTEs to streamline T-SQL code and to query self-referential tables.

# Query Tuning in the Clouds
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Professional Development / Misc
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Query Tuning in the Clouds
## Abstract:
### Just because you're using an Azure SQL database does not mean you can avoid tuning queries. Microsoft has throttling in place that could seriously impact your systems if your queries are using up lots of resources. This session will introduce you to the tools you have available to identify poor performing queries, such as dynamic management objects and others. You'll learn how to understand why a query is running slow using the Azure Portal execution plans. This understanding will enable you to fix your poorly performing queries.  All in the cloud.

# Database Backups for the Accidental DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Database Backups for the Accidental DBA
## Abstract:
### You've fallen into a job that requires you to manage a SQL Server Database Management System. Now you have to keep these databases on their feet. You've heard of this concept called a backup, and it sounds great, but you sure don't know what it is. This session is for you. We're going to go over backups, right from the beginning, so that when you come out of this session you can go back to your systems and set up backups, log backups, differentials, and anything else you might need. Further, you'll know how to recover your database in the event of an actual failure. The fundamentals you need to get a good backup in place and then be able to restore it will be covered in this session.

## Speaker: Jessica Moss
## Title: Getting Reports on Your Schedule
## Abstract:
### Too often reports sent on a daily basis end up in a mail filter. Only a small percentage of the reports are actually necessary for someone to take action. How happy would your users be if you could only provide the report when they actually needed to look at it? You can, by using subscriptions and alerts in Reporting Services 2012. This session will provide a comparison of regular subscriptions, data-driven subscriptions, and data-driven alerts in Reporting Services 2012 in SharePoint Integrated mode. Attend this session to learn how to provide reports that will be read rather than filtered.

# Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#187---Richmond-2013)
Event Date: 09-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Mixed
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Windowing Functions: THE Reason to Upgrade to 2012
## Abstract:
### For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.   And these are NOT limited to Enterprise Edition, like so many other really useful and important features!  The range of data processing needs that can be very efficiently and cleanly solved with these tools is stunning. In this demo-packed session we will cover as many features as we can pack into an hour's time, and you can take the demo code back home with you to review at your leisure!

## Speaker: Kevin Hazzard
## Title: Creating an Extensible Data Quality Foundation
## Abstract:
### Data Quality (DQ) tools are typically expensive and difficult to integrate into your ETL and governance plans but it doesn't have to be that way. During this fun, highly-interactive session, Kevin Hazzard (Microsoft Windows Azure MVP and author of the book Metaprogramming in .NET), will show you how to implement a modular, highly resilient DQ foundation from the tools you already own, no matter which version of SQL Server you're using today. At the end of this discussion, Kevin will give you a copy of his schema and his standard DQ function library that you can use in your own databases.
