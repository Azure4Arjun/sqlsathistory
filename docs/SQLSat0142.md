## Title: Building your first BI Semantic Model Tabular
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduces the new Analysis Services Tabular Mode. BI Semantic Model (BISM) Tabular is in-memory database in Analysis Services using state-of-the-art compression algorithms. BI Semantic Models can be developed in either Visual Studio or in Excel using the SQL Server 2012 PowerPivot add-in. In this session, I will show you how to build a complete solution in Tabular and creating one from the ground up, deploy a rich semantic model and discover a simpler method for analyzing business data. You also learn the basics of DAX language and how to manage role based security and partitioning in a Tabular model. You will be able to create your BISM Tabular models, and gain a solid background to enable you starting your next project.

# Table Compression
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#142---Waltham-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Table Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

# Transitioning from SQL Trace to Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#142---Waltham-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jack Corbett
## Title: Transitioning from SQL Trace to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Extended Events were introduced with SQL Server 2008, but without a UI, which meant using T-SQL to create and manage them and using XPath and XQuery to parse the output.  Microsoft has added an Extended Events UI in SQL Server 2012 and also added additional events.  With the announcement that SQL Trace/Profiler is being deprecated now is the time to begin learning Extended Events.  This session will show you how to take existing Traces and convert them to Extended Event Sessions.

## Speaker: David Taylor
## Title: To click or to type, that is the question 
## Abstract:
### When adminstering SQL Server, in SSMS are you a clicker or a typer? This session explores the use of the GUI vs. using scripting in SSMS to get day to day tasks accomplished, with a bent toward scripting for increased accuracy, control and speed. Tasks are illustrated through the use of the Day-to-Day section of Brad McGeehee's Sure DBA Checklist at http://www.bradmcgehee.com , Used with Permission and Great Thanks.

## Speaker: Kathy  Gibbs
## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware
## Abstract:
### SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: New Server in an Hour? No Problem!
## Abstract:
### "We need a new server before you leave on vacation!" Never mind that it's Friday at 2:00 PM and you need to be in the airport in a couple of hours. This isn't the time to panic. Mike Hillwig deploys new servers every week and has a streamlined process that allows him to deploy a new server in an hour from delivery of the Windows server. We're not talking just installing SQL Server. This is having the new server production-ready in an hour, including scripts to backup, monitor, and maintain databases. With a little bit of advanced planning, following a few simple rules, and some scripting, you can be ready for just such an emergency. And you'll still catch you flight!

## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: Aviation Disasters - And IT Lessons From Them
## Abstract:
### What does a plane crash have to do with technical skills? You might be surprised. There are many lessons to be learned from disasters. Most accidents are caused not by one factor, but by a series of seemingly-small missteps; even if a freak accident occurs, training and preparation can make all the difference - it's the same for us! In this session we’ll have a group discussion through a few actual aviation disasters and see what skills, attitudes and thought processes led to them. We'll look at some success stories and see what was different. We'll see how these attitudes and decisions impact us at work and talk about how to identify them in ourselves and our teams. Then we'll figure out how to prevent them in our day jobs.

## Title: Network or Perish
## Abstract:
### As IT personnel, we tend to get boxed-in, stranded on our own little island. We fail to make people aware of our activities, both within our own organization and in our wider professional circles. Just like a shipwrecked captain waiting for the rescue boat on a desert island, if you fail to communicate, your career will be stuck with no possibility of progression. This presentation will show you how to leverage networking and self-marketing techniques that will allow you to set sail off the island and into new opportunities.

## Title: Intuitive and ad-hoc reporting using Power View
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Power View (formerly known as Project Crescent) provides intuitive ad-hoc reporting for business users such as data analysts, business decision makers, and information workers. They can easily create and interact with views of data from tabular models based on PowerPivot workbooks published in a PowerPivot Gallery, or tabular models deployed to Analysis Services (SSAS). Power View is a browser-based Silverlight application launched from SharePoint Server 2010.

In this session I will give you an overview of the key features of Power View and then I will develop some of these views.

## Speaker: Varsham Papikian
## Title: SQL Server Data Tools(SSDT) a.k.a. "Juneau"
## Abstract:
### SSDT is a brand new new integrated environment for database developers. It's based on VS2010 Shell and it will replace 'Database Projects' found in VS2010. Database Developers should be able to perform most, if not all of their work without any need to switch to a different tool. It enables Declarative, Model-Based database development, allows to develop both online/offline, enables local testing and SQL Server version-aware targeting. SSDT also makes it easy to integrate your code with Source Control Systems like TFS. At the beginning of the session I will explain what is declarative, model-based development and why do we need it. Then I will demonstrate the power of SSDT by showing how to use.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data
## Abstract:
### SSRS 2008 R2 provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many of these features, such as the server aggregation function, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.
