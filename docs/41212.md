## Title: Datawarehouse in the Cloud with Azure
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Datawarehouse is the latest SQL related cloud service, Microsoft released in Preview. It uses Microsoftâ€™s massive parallel processing (MPP) architecture where you pay for time-to-insight, not hardware, based on performance objectives for fundamental data warehousing operations like scanning, loading, and query processing. Quickly deployable, it is definitely one of the services that will change the gear in the datawarehoue world. Join me in the session where I will provide a quick overview of the service and show you how easily you can migrate and start using it.
