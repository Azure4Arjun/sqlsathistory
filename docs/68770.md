## Title: Play Data - Increase Your Power BI Skills With Free and Fun Data Sets
## Abstract:
### Many of us have by now dipped our toes into the Power BI pool and liked it so much we thought we were ready to swim out to the deep end and dive right into analyzing data from our day to day jobs, whatever that may be.  Soon we discover that we are now actually working. No fun. Using freely available data sets and some that I have modified from "work" to "play" with data that interests me,  I will show how you can find, model,  and analyze the data you find interesting as well.  And then you can go back to work which should be much easier now.
