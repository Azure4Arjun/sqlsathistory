## Title: Introduction to ETL with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
## Abstract:
### In this session, geared toward beginner level users, attendees will be introduced to SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) as an ETL tool. We will review the SSIS workspace and toolbox to familiarize users with the various features offered and how to navigate between them, as well as discuss their functionality. We will then build an SSIS package to extract data from a flat file source and load it into a SQL Server Database. The session will conclude by reviewing best practices surrounding the documentation of SSIS solutions, and attendees will receive a copy of documentation describing the package we created. 

This session is designed for users with little to no familiarity with SSIS who are looking for a baseline understanding of the tool, or who want to begin working more with SSIS development but do not know where to begin.
