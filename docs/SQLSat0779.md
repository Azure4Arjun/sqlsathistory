## Speaker: Cláudio Silva
## Title: Administrating SSRS/PBIRS was a boring task! Sorry...did you said WAS?
## Abstract:
### Once in a while I need to deploy dozens of reports, data sources, permissions and subscriptions across multiple Reporting Services folders. 
Some time ago, I accomplished this by hand, wasting hours of my life. Nowadays it takes me a couple of minutes and I'm done.

In this session I will share how you can leverage on ReportingServicesTools PowerShell module to deploy your reports, manage permissions and subscriptions and stop waste your time with some of those trivial tasks.

# Parallel Query Processing in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Dmitry Pilugin
## Title: Parallel Query Processing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Depending on a query plan SQL Server may choose to process a query in a serial or a parallel way. With a parallel query processing a server may utilize more CPUs and complete a query faster, however, managing parallel execution is not simple and demands additional resources, so for some quires a serial execution is better. The balance is important.

In this session we will look at the balance from the Query Processor prospective. We will learn the reasons: how and why does a server choose a parallel or a serial plan. We will learn how to read and interpret parallel plans and look at some important aspects of a parallel plan analysis. After this session you will know what to look at, when the next time you have to deal with parallelism in SQL Server.

# T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing
## Abstract:
### This session aims to explore all the features offered by the language T-SQL for aggregating and calculating data. There's much more of the clause GROUP BY.
With grouping and ranking functions you can calculate in your query grandtotal, running totals, find islands in intervals, select the last-not-null value, etc.
Windows functions apply directly on a set of rows defined by the OVER clause ("a window"). Windows function do not perform aggregation on group level and do not hide row details.
So they allow mixing detail and total elements in the same query.
The session is mainly based on a copious array of demos, to make explicit every concept introduced taking into account the impact on performances for every solution.

# Execution plans ... where do I start?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution plans ... where do I start?
## Abstract:
### SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That's where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it's slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

# When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.

# Query profiling options in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Karol Papaj
## Title: Query profiling options in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Developer’s best practice is to check query plan before the query or procedure is ready for testing or moving into production. We have two kinds of plans for this purpose -  Estimated and Actual Execution Plan. Both plans can be obtained easily during development – just make an appropriate action before you run the query and you will get what you want – either Estimated or Actual Execution plan.
The situation in production is a bit complicated. In some cases exploring the plan cache and analyzing Estimated plans can be good enough to fix problematic queries. In other cases we would need to analyze runtime statistics, available in Actual Execution Plans only. 
In this session we will cover query profiling infrastructure available in SQL Server since SQL Server 2008 (including SQL Server 2019) and query profiling options on global, session and query level.

## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Football Feelings Quantified – Ranking Clubs by Supporter Sentiment
## Abstract:
### Regardless of what football league you follow, some years the title chase can be quite boring. A football podcast in the US (Men in Blazers) came up with an interesting idea - what if we ranked the English Premier League by the Twitter sentiment of the supporters at the end of the match? I heard that episode and created the Premier League Mood Table for them to discuss on the podcast. While the premise of a mood table might be quite silly, the underlying concepts and technology are relevant to any company with a social media sales presence. Join me as I walk us through using Azure Logic Apps, Cognitive Services, and Azure SQL Database to store and analyze Twitter sentiment that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours as well!

## Speaker: Grzegorz Stolecki
## Title: Predictive Reporting Services Performance Monitoring
## Abstract:
### Every user wants to have his/hers reports generated quickly. But reality isn't so cute. Sometimes you have to wait and wait, and wait again while looking at the rotating green circle.
During my session you will learn how to monitor Reporting Services with the Execution Log.  I will show the structure of the log and some useful queries to get precise insights into report generating process. Analysing the log gives you a quick way to find bottlenecks and sources of your problems. Especially when you use a tool like Power BI or Excel to create a functional dashboard. You also will learn how to use R powered models in Power BI to predict problems with your reports execution.

# The Complete Guide to Temporary Tables and Table Variables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#779-Prague-2018)
Event Date: 08-12-2018 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Guy Glantser
## Title: The Complete Guide to Temporary Tables and Table Variables
## Abstract:
### It is very common to use temporary data structures in the database. In SQL Server, we can choose between temporary tables (#MyTable) and table variables (@MyTable). There are many differences between these two structures, some are obvious and well known, and some might surprise you.
The main difference in terms of performance is statistics, which exist for a temporary table, but do not exist for a table variable. For that reason, there can be a huge difference in performance of a stored procedure that uses one data structure or the other.
In this session, we will demonstrate the differences and analyze performance for various use cases. We will cover all kinds of ways to work with these data structures, such as OPTION (RECOMPILE) and trace flag 2453.
By the end of this session you will know exactly when and how to use each one in order to achieve the desired functionality with the best performance.
This is a must session for every SQL Server developer.
