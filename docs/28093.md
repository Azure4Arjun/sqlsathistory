### SQL Server MVP and Business Intelligence Architect Bill Pearson leads an introduction to using Excel 2013 to deliver self-service business intelligence.  The focus of this session is to help those unfamiliar with the BI features that debut in Excel 2013 to become familiar with the assembly of data from diverse sources into models that deliver BI upon demand.  Weâ€™ll discuss accessing and relating data, and employing the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language, to construct and share PowerPivot applications that support analysis and reporting throughout the enterprise.
