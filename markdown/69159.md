## Abstract:
### We have an enormous set of tools for analysis and pattern matching in the data ecosystem. Among the most used, we can find solutions that come from the academic world such as R, others integrated as part of productivity solutions such as SQL Server Analysis Services or Excel, as well as cloud based hosted solutions such as Azure Machine Learning and Power BI.
