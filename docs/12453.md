## Title: A real DBA don’t need a GUI -A Guided Tour of SQL Server Management Studio
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Management Studio is at the heart of any SQL Server DBA or developer’s day. We take it for granted  but rarely do we take a look at how we can customise or improve it to make our day to day work easier and more productive. 
This presentation will show you how to use SSMS and will look at many of the hidden features and shortcuts that you had forgotten about or didn’t know were there.
At the end of this session you will have learnt at least one new feature of SSMS that you can use to improve your productivity.
