## Title: Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree (from a user perspective)
## Abstract:
### This session dives down and looks at the important items on data pages of clustered, non-clustered, and unique non-clustered indexes using the DBCC Page command. It will also look at the effect of row data compression on clustered and non-clustered indexes. In all demos we will try to ascertain how the SQL Server® optimizer might use them and also strive to gain some insight from a performance advantage.  Its purpose is mainly to try and understand how SQL Server implements indexes, their underlying structure, and where performance benefits might lie from a layman’s viewpoint.  Session is 80% demos.
