## Title: Continuous integration for BI
## Abstract:
### Team Foundation Server (TFS) is a collaboration platform to manage the lifecycle of your BI Solution. In this session, we are going to focus on the interaction between SSDT, SSIS, TFS and automated testing. 

I will demonstrative how to do develop, test and publish and publishing the changes to an on-premises instance of SQL Server. We will look at how we can do continuous integration of Databases and other BI elements between development and diffrent environments in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solution. 

Testing will cover different aspects of SQL, SSAS and execution of SSIS packages for test-purposes to ensure simple setup of test-cases and both manual and automated execution.
