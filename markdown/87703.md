You'll see first-hand how easy it is to migrate databases from on-premises to a Managed Instance. We'll explore the differences between Azure SQL Database, Managed Instances, and SQL Server on an Azure VM to help you determine which is the best fit for your organization's requirements. If you've been considering Azure for your organization, this session is for you!
