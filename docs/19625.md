## Title: Introduction to SQL Spatial Analysis and Reporting
## Abstract:
### Most all data captured today is tied in some way to spatial elements.  SQL Server has powerful functionality that will allow you to leverage this information to get deeper insights and make better decisions.  We will walk through demonstrations of basic reporting and analysis involving place data.  We will use "in house" analytical/spatial data along with openly available spatial data.  Demos will show the various spatial functions for data analysis along with reporting using reporting services, powerview, and geoflow.
