## Speaker: Travis Page
## Title: Look, over there, your permissions are showing!
## Abstract:
### You just walked into that fancy new gig, and you're getting your first cup of coffee.  Your boss walks up and asks, "Who has access to that prod server?", do you know how to get the answers in the next hour?  More importantly, do you know what these permissions mean, what an attacker could do with these permissions?  In this session we'll start from scratch assuming that you have no experience with an audit with this question in mind.  We'll work back from here to develop a strategy of how to harden your server.
