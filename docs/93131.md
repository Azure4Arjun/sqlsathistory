## Title: "M" is great! Keep it that way.
## Abstract:
### Power BI is great for modelling. Having the ability to edit and clean your data quick and easy is one of its greatest boons. It is however very easy to have your model bogged down with applied steps. This talk will open the window to best practices with modelling and how to utilise "M" to your advantage.
