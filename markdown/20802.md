## Title: Azure SQL DB Resource Management
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service that delivers predictable performance, scalability, business continuity and data protection for cloud developers. Azure SQL Database service is built on shared resources from thousands of physical machines at Microsoft Data Centers. Each physical machine host many databases; availability and performance for each database can vary based on other activities on the physical machine. Azure SQL Database uses some techniques to manage resources and provide a stable system with optimal usage of physical servers.
I will overview the architectural layers and internals of Azure SQL Database and then focus on resource management techniques like load balancing, engine throttling, using resource governor to isolate load on physical machines. We will go over resource limitations on Azure SQL Database like memory usage, database size, transaction duration and Temp DB usage. Finally, we will conclude with best practices
