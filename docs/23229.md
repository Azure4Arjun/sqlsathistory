## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: A Few Of My Favourite Query Plan Operators
## Abstract:
### Without feeling any need to resort to any kind of Julie Andrews rendition... 

Query plan operators do all the work when you run a query, and some of them are more significant than others. You may have learned about Seeks and Lookups, and about different Join operators, but when I look at a plan and see certain operators, some of them convey a lot more information than you may realise. This talk will look at operators such as "Merge Join (Concat)", "Top N Sort", "Filter", "Hash Match (Distinct Sort)", and more, exploring the significance of some of some of their properties, and helping you raise your game when it comes to performance tuning.
