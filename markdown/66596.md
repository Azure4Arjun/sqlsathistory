## Title: Configuring DBaaS for the first time!
## Abstract:
### Are you new to Azure?  Are you new to DBaaS?  This is the perfect session for you!  We will discuss the deployment of the server, as well as how to template it.  We will cover what you configure once the server is deployed(resource locks, firewall, etc).  What maintenance does Microsoft provide?  What is an elastic pool?  What maintenance is still your responsibility?  Overwhelmed yet?   Don't be, by the end of this session, you will have enough knowledge on how to create your very first DBaaS instance.  This session is geared towards new users of Azure DBaaS and future users of Azure DBaaS.
