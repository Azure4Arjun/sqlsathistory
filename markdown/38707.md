## Title: Power Query para Power BI: De Cero al [M]#225;ximo
## Abstract:
### Power Query is a free add-in created by Microsoft for Excel 2010 (or later) and also for the Power BI Designer. It’s an intuitive tool that lets you manipulate, transform, consolidate, enrich, merge and do much more with your data. It also acts as an ETL tool which means that it Extracts data from almost any data source, Transforms that data somehow and then Loads it somewhere – in our case that’s either Excel, Power Pivot or the Power BI Designer canvas.

In short, this is THE best Data tool for the Business User.

In this session you'll learn the basics of this tool and how some things are even easier with this tool than with something like SSIS.
