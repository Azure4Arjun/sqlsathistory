## Title: Change Data Capture in SQL Server 2008/2012
## Abstract:
### In this session, I'll talk about Change Data Capture (CDC) terminology and configuring a database for Change Data Capture. I'll show how to read CDC log tables, and show CDC code samples. I'll discuss CDC and SQL Server Agent jobs, and the use of CDC versus database triggers (and where triggers are still needed). Also, the impact of CDC on the transaction log and system performance will be explored. Finally, I'll talk about how to deal with schema changes, performance tuning, and using CDC in an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) environment with SQL Server Integration Services.   Time Permitting, I'll show some of the SSIS 2012 enhancements in dealing with CDC
