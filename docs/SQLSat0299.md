# Tally 'Em Up
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#299---Columbus-2014)
Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Performance
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Tally 'Em Up
## Abstract:
### Database administrators as a rule hate Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) solutions due to how poorly they perform in T-SQL. Sometimes, though, it seems as though we need to make do and take that performance hit. This presentation will show you that the humble tally table can eliminate RBAR-dependency across a number of different problem spaces, including splitting text, validating dates, and even reporting on errors. With plenty of examples, you'll get to see exactly how powerful a tally table can be.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Abstract:
### Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Transactional Replication-10 steps for successful implementation
## Abstract:
### What is potentially our biggest problem with transactional replication? You guessed it...it breaks! It may break for a variety of reasons and we as DBA’s probably have experienced them all at one point or another. Our biggest worry? Bringing replication back online whenever a full snapshot reinitialization is not an option due to time or space concerns. But don't you worry; we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves! During this session, we will go over options available to you to re-sync your replication with minimal downtime for your production environments.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Speaker: Brian Davis
## Title: SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier
## Abstract:
### How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.

Event Date: 14-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS  ETL
## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Unit Testing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.
