## Title: Power BI – Finally I can make decisions based on facts
## Abstract:
### SSW’s Chief Architect, Adam Cogan, will take you through his personal journey of discovery into the world of Power BI.

He will show in a live demo how Power BI allows even non-technical users to produce and share invaluable reports and dashboards.
