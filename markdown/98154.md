## Title: PaaSport to Paradise: Lifting  Shifting with Azure SQL Database + SSIS in Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI, configure it to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will next show you how to use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to design/test/deploy/execute your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. We will finally show you how to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking/scheduling SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combining/chaining them with other activities, allowing you to trigger your pipeline runs by events, automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, etc.
