## Abstract:
### In this talk we will delve into the particularities of time series data. We will introduce what time series data is and which specific systems and services exist to support the management and analysis of time series data. Specifically, we will take a look at Azure Time Series Insights and its functionality. We will compare it (mainly) with the Open Source system InfluxDB and the TICK Stack utilizing a practical example which covers the setup and implementation of an analysis task and visualize the near real-time results accordingly.
