## Title: A Survey of the Azure Data Platform
## Abstract:
### Choosing where to store your data is far more difficult than ever. We can be paralyzed with choice! This session seeks to ease that anxiety and provide direction for application developers and DBAs. You'll learn the differences between DocumentDB, Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL in a VM, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Analytics, Azure Data Lake Store, and more. See demos and review case studies so you'll have a complete view of how data is stored in Azure and how to choose between these great tools.
