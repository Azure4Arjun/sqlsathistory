## Title: Case study: How we simulated a lights-out data center DR test
## Abstract:
### Traditional DR tests may include application-specific recovery tests, or perhaps your workplace holds an annual "DR weekend" when you test the recoverability of your applications, and measure yourself against your own RPO's and RTO's.

With our applications now running in cloud, whether IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS, we typically must trust vendors' SLA's, and sometimes must design our own DR plan. 

This case study is a real-world story about how we decided to test our DR plans when our various applications run in the cloud. We used Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup Services, some Inf-as-Code solutions, a lot of automation, and some pre-configured but powered down infrastructure. I'd be happy to share our lessons learned.
