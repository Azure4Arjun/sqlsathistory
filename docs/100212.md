## Speaker: Dave Mason
## Title: Auditing and Taming SQL Server Permissions
## Abstract:
### Excessive authorizations violate the principal of least privilege and put you and your organization at risk. In this session, we'll review how to identify the server and database principals that pose the greatest threats to the security, availability, and recoverability of SQL Server. Then we'll look at a real world example and show how to "downsize" permissions to a more appropriate level that both administrators and users can live with.
