# Power BI Dataset Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#919-Atlanta-BI-Edition-2019)
Event Date: 19-10-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Armando Lacerda
## Title: Power BI Dataset Tuning
## Abstract:
### Most Power BI reports rely on a small dataset. And due to a lighting fast data engine most data model mistakes are shadowed by the speed of the service. When the dataset gets bigger then best data modeling practices are required. The trick here is Power BI data engine is not relational and therefore most data modeling techniques either don’t apply or don’t deliver. In this session we will go over how to model and measure performance for larger Power BI datasets.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

## Speaker: Samara Soucy
## Title: Power BI Embedded for Fun and Profit
## Abstract:
### You COULD hire a front end developer to build data visualizations for your app. You COULD use "Publish to Web" to expose your sensitive data to anyone who gets a hold of the link. You COULD even force your users to leave what they were working on and tab over to the Power BI service to look at the data relevant to their current task.

None of that is fun, and it certainly isn't the most efficient use of time or funds. Fortunately, Power BI embedded is coming to your rescue. You can use the visualizations you've already built, keep the security you've already put in place, and allow your users to view contextual data in your applications-- right where they need it. You'll learn how embedding works within the Power BI service and how to create a successful embedded deployment.

## Speaker: Paul Waters
## Title: SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) = Awesome
## Abstract:
### Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is awesome! Here are a few reasons why.

- Create and organize database objects more easily with the Database project template.
- Write SQL code faster with IntelliSense.
- Checks for errors in real-time to identify mistakes quickly. 
- Makes refactoring database objects seem like magic.
- Includes powerful tools for comparing database schemas and data.
- Integrates with source control systems including GIT.
- Helps make team development easier and safer.
- Enables continuous integration and deployment for modern end-to-end application lifecycle (ALM) practices.

Best of all… It’s free! Also, it works with all versions of Visual Studio – including the free community edition.
In this presentation, I will show you how to get started with SSDT, get some quick wins, and touch on some of the advanced features. By the end of the presentation, I hope to make you as excited about SSDT as I am.

## Title: Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar
## Abstract:
### In the world of Power BI, data modeling is what separates the Rockstars from the Rookies. Join me to learn how dimensional modeling - a concept developed 20+ years ago - continues to be the best approach for delivering self-service BI to the masses.

Not only will good data modeling result in better Power BI solutions that support a wider range of reporting requirements, but they will also be easier for the business users to understand and work with. 

In this session, you'll learn how to create flexible data models that can be expanded upon over time, unlock the power of the date table, and a variety of DAX patterns supporting common but complex business logic.
 
If your Power BI solutions typically contain a single table, if you're frequently banging your head against the wall trying to figure out how to write a DAX calculation, or if you've never heard the term "dimensional model" or "star-schema", this session is for you.
