## Title: How to perform a health check
## Abstract:
### Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, weâ€™ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.
