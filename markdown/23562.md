## Title: PowerPivot and Power View for the Business Analyst
## Abstract:
### Excel 2013 brings PowerPivot and Power View to the desktop (without downloading add-ins) so you should get ready for it. Your users will google Power View and try to make magic with their own data. Unfortunately it isn't as simple as uploading a grid of excel data into PowerPivot and exploring it with Power View. We will work with an imaginary Business Analyst who needs help bringing their data to life.
