## Title: T-SQL Brush-up:The Best Things You Forgot You Knew
## Abstract:
### You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements like MERGE, OVER, and PARTITION BY. This session is chock full of code examples, including before-and-after demos and how-to illustrations.
