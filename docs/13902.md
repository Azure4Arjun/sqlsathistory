## Title: SSMS for Non-DBA Developers
## Abstract:
### You're a database application developer who's using SQL Server now, but you're no DBA.  Sure you use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and maybe you're even pretty good at designing tables and executing queries. But there's a whole lot more functionality in this seemingly simple program than you may realize. In this session we'll share features in SSMS that you may have overlooked but will make your life as a developer a lot easier.
