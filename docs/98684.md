## Title: More Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise PBI Deployment
## Abstract:
### Power BI is an amazing tool for end-user analytics and reporting, but if you don't architect for it correctly it may not work right as an enterprise reporting solution. Come to this session to get actual implementation details from a real deployment that was completed for a mid-sized company (1,500+ employees) and is being used daily by more than half of the employees after only a few months of being live in production. Using demos and actual documentation you will see what you need to think of for a project like this. We will be covering architecture, implementation, governance, change control, and support to get a Power BI enterprise deployment working successfully from someone that has done it! Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium will be discussed and how each is being used in this solution as well.
Prerequisites: Understanding of reporting/modeling in an enterprise setting is helpful, but not required for this session
