## Title: So you've built a cube...Now what?  MDX essentials
## Abstract:
### MDX is an elegant and powerful query language for SQL Server Analysis Services but it's not easy for most to figure out, unguided.  This session is led by Microsoft BI Architect, author and SQL Server MVP, Paul Turley.  We will start with a review of the basic of concepts of cubes, dimensions and hierarchies.  From the ground up, you will learn how to use MDX query constructs to report business analytical data to your users with measures, calculated members, KPIs, slicers.  You'll learn to use some of the most useful MDX functions so you can take what you learn and put it to practical use next Monday morning.
