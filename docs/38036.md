## Title: Metadata-driven Automatic Package Creation with Biml - Notes From The Field
## Abstract:
### We already know what Biml is. But how do we leverage its power to create next generation ETL? In this session we want to show you different approaches to package creation with Biml, based on user-specified metadata. We'd like to show you advanced scenarios, some lightweight metadata storages, and MDS. We'll also cover live database discovery, automatic database object creation, automatic data type normalization, flexible incremental stage loading, and more.
