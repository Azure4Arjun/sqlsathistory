## Speaker: Walter Shields
## Title: Remember what itâ€™s like to be a Beginner?
## Abstract:
### As an educator, I have seen such a wide demographic of people being attracted to databases and SQL. Wanting to understand how it all works and eager to learn this technology. From students majoring in computer science, business, and marketing to working professionals like developers, business analyst, marketing analyst and business managers. 

This is the new crop of beginners I see every day that are attracted to you and what you do as a professional in database technology! 

The thing is, as attractive as we are; to someone who wishes to enter this field; the actual steps they must take to become part of this profession can seem daunting. 

In this session, I will walk us down memory lane back to the place we all started, as a beginner. I will raise your awareness of just how influential you already are and how you can use that influence to help those starting on their journey to understanding databases and SQL.
