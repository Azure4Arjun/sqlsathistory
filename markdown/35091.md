## Title: Resource Governor in SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### One of the new features in SQL Server 2008 is the resource governor.  With increasingly consolidated SQL Server environments, and particularly with applications with complex performance requirements, this new feature will provide more fine grained control over how your solutions work.  During this session we will review the functionality included in this feature, identify scenarios where it can be used, and show how to implement it.
