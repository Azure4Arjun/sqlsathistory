## Title: Back to the future - Migrating our SQL Server On-premises database to Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### We will cover the main aspects to migrate to one of the three architectures available in SQL Server in Azure from SQL Server On-premises. 
 
This session consists of:
-> What is the best platform for my environment? IaaS, PaaS, or SQL Datawarehouse.
-> Best Practices and best tools for our migration process depending on the platform chosen.
-> After the migration, we have several outstanding questions:
            Can I keep both environments synchronized?
             How is the performance of my database
