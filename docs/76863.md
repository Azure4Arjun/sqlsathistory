## Speaker: Jacob Ross Andersen
## Title: Automate DWH  BI development using TimeXtender Discovery Hub®
## Abstract:
### Lunch and Data Warehouse Automation are perfect together, so join us and eat your lunch whilst viewing a complete end-to-end solution be built, in just 30 mins.
 

In this session, we will demonstrate the power of Discovery Hub® by building an end-to-end solution from scratch in just 30min. We automate the majority of the tedious tasks related to a DWH project with high quality auto-generated scripts, documentation, data lineage tracing managed deployment/execution and many other value-adding features. We accelerate BI projects dramatically and allows BI developers to focus their efforts on the tricky modelling tasks, rather than the majority of standard technical steps.

The session will include steps like:

Connect to a data source
Build an Operational Data Exchange
Stage data with examples of common ETL tasks
Create a Data Warehouse
Define a Semantic Model
Visualize data with visualization tool”
