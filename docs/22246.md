## Title: SSIS - manage concurrent processing using SQL Server Broker
## Abstract:
### In this session we will do a case study for a typical situation in industries like telecommunication or healthcare. We have a stream of multiple relatively small files incoming from external system and we need to load them to SQL Server database in near-real-time. Typical examples are CDR billing files, HL7 diagnostic results or medical claims.
In this session we will cover how we can use WMI event watchers to monitor for incoming files and we examine option for managing worker treads loading the files. We will look into SQL Server broker queues, conversations between treads and activation to achieve robust solution.
