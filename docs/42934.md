## Title: Introduction to U-SQL
## Abstract:
### U-SQL is the new kid on the SQL language block. In this session we'll look at the what, where, why and how of the language. Is it a query language? Is it a data transformation language? Will it replace T-SQL? Should you learn it? How do you learn it? We'll discuss all this and more.
