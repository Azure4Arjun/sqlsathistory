## Title: Biml 101: Automation and Patterns
## Abstract:
### Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) is a programming language for creating business intelligence objects. It is a simple XML that can be extended with small nuggets of C# or VB code to automatically generate SQL scripts, SSIS packages and SSAS cubes. It will allow you to turn tedious repetitive tasks into reusable scripts - no more drag-and-dropping! Using Biml will significantly cut down development time, reduce errors and improve quality of your code. In this session, you'll find out everything you need to know to start with Biml development. Our focus will be on SSIS solutions.
