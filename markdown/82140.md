## Title: Inside the SQLServer PowerShell Module
## Abstract:
### SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS and the new SqlServer module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.
