## Title: Understanding Query Modes in Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Model allows rapid and simplified data modelling of Business Intelligence solutions. An important aspect that is often overlooked when building a tabular model, is meeting real-time requirements. In this session you will learn how to tackle immediate (or close to) real time requirements using the different types of Data Access and Query Modes of Tabular Model and how your choice impacts your reporting options in the Microsoft BI stack.

Using live demo, this session will outline advantages and disadvantages between DirectQuery and In-Memory modes. We will also highlight impersonation and partitioning differences between the two modes. Finally, we will also cover the definition of a Hybrid Tabular Model solution.
