## Title: Catalog Views and the Art of Template Creation
## Abstract:
### A look at the Sql Server catalog views to understand the contents of your database.  From there we'll utilize the catalog views to generate templates that help uncover potential issues within our database.  We will also use the catalog views to create useable templates and enforce local T-SQL coding standards.
