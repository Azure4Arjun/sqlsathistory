## Title: Harvesting Web Data Using Data Explorer and XML
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover the basics of using Data Explorer (Now called Power Query) + other tools to explore XML data from the SQL Saturday website.  We will look at lesser-known features like XML feeds, harvesting data from other websites, and social media sources using open source tools like Curl (a command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax).  We will use Business Intelligence tools such as the new Data Explorer and SQL Server to download and analyze the XML.
