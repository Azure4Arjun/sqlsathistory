## Title: SANLess Clustering on the Ground and In the Cloud 
## Abstract:
### I'll tell you how to create a cluster to protect SQL Server in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible. For example, I’ll show you how to create a cluster using local high performance SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage for faster SQL application response times and high availability protection and I’ll discuss how to use native SQL Failover Clusters in the Amazon Cloud. You will also learn how you can build a cluster that eliminates the cost and single point of failure risk of SAN storage.  Topics covered: - How to create a cluster using local high performance storage to accelerate SQL Server without sacrificing availability - Benefits of AlwaysOn Failover Clustering vs. AlwaysOn Availability Groups - Availability options of SQL Server Standard Edition vs. Enterprise Edition - How to add high availability and disaster protection to your SQL Server Amazon EC2 instances
