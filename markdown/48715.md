## Title: Easy ETL with Biml
## Abstract:
### Can ETL be fun? Unfortunately very often creation of ETL layer is a time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone task. What’s more, any change in requirements needs a lot of work to be redone. In our session we’ll present new approach to creating BI solutions using Biml language and BimlStudio programming environment. They greatly simplify the process, allowing for amazing flexibility, and make the ETL work more pleasant. We will show real examples of how Biml and C# generates hundreds of usable SSIS packages in just couple of minutes. We will also cover integration of ETL with TFS and CI for ETL. Everything with 100% compatibility with unmodified SQL Server. Join us and see how BI just became fun again.
