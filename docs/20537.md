## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: What the VLF? 
## Abstract:
### Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.
