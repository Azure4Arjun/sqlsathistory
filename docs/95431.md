## Title: Building Scalable Cloud Databases
## Abstract:
### Usually when developers and DBAs talk about scaling databases we mean 'scaling up' our database server to handle the increased demands of our users.
But what if 'scaling up' isn't the only or best answer? 
What if we're building a multi-tenant SaaS application, and want to have a single front-end for each of our clients, but have multiple back-end databases to segregate customer data?
In this talk, we'll look at ways we can scale our SQL Server Databases 'out' instead of 'up'.
We will touch on a few database design considerations before diving into the Elastic Database Client libraries to see how we can add intelligent data-dependent-routing to our applications, ensuring that each request is routed to the correct database. 
Finally, we will explore how Azure Elastic Database Pools can be used to optimize our database workloads in Azure.
