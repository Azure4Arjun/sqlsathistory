## Speaker: Tim Warner
## Title: A Real, Live PowerShell Beginner's Tutorial
## Abstract:
### This is for the PowerShell precon. The problem I've seen with most PowerShell "beginner's tutorials" is that they almost always go way beyond the basics. In this session, in which participants are expected to be utterly brand-new to the technology, we cover the true basics, focusing on only three commands: Get-Command, Get-Help, and Get-Member. I can do this in 60 or 90 minutes, although I'd prefer the latter.
