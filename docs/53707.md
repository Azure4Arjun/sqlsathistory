## Speaker: John Sterrett
## Title: Synthetic vs Real-World Workloads: Benchmark Throwdown!
## Abstract:
### How much do you really understand how your workload changes based on the time of day, background processing, user load, or which application module is in use? There's no better way to understand your workload than to benchmark and replay it. This will help you mitigate risk in production before making changes, allow you to find and improve bottlenecks in your code or infrastructure. In this session, you will learn how to compare and replay your own workload and synthetic TPC-C workloads in your environment to make you look like a rockstar.
