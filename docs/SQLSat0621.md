# SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#621---Silicon-Valley-2017)
Event Date: 22-04-2017 - Session time: 17:00:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: J May
## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
## Abstract:
### Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. 

Our work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.

Event Date: 22-04-2017 - Session time: 17:00:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: The New Revolution in Data Science, R integrated into SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages.  

The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will introduce R and demonstrate the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server. 

This presentation is ideally suited for Business Intelligence professionals that are interested in understanding the new R Service that is being added to SQL Server.

## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Consolidated Essential Performance Health Check using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Standardizing essential performance health check is the key in responding quickly to production issues and can cut down initial evaluation phase to 1/3rd of the time, whether you have been requested to do health check or you may want to run these due to an alert. These sets of essential checks can be the first major checkpoint for a DBA, they can look quickly on consolidated email stats first to decide if any further action is required to fix an issue or is it feasible to jump into in-depth troubleshooting. This will cut down on time and effort while responding to Production issues.

First part of the email shares some key observations about SQL Server performance which can be the key to quick resolution of the issue. Rest of the email shows different set of stats regarding CPU/Disk IO/Disk Space/Memory/Network/Blocking and database performance which could lead to the slowness observed in the application. This consolidated email can be shared with technical stakeholders to give a snaps

## Speaker: Andy Parkerson
## Title: Programming in Power Query: An Introduction to M
## Abstract:
### While the DAX language gets all of the Power BI attention and love, its partner M is nonetheless a powerful workhorse that can be harnessed to do amazing things. We will begin by introducing ourselves to the functional language by building a calendar -- absolutely necessary for all of those lovely DAX time intelligence functions to work. From establishing the time period in question to deciding on what information we need and how we want it presented, our understanding of M will grow as we progress through this construction.

We then look at what to do when the information you get is incomplete and contradictory. Cleaning up data and handling errors and missing data will be our focus in an example of combining multiple data sources into a single data set. We consider this crucial step in the ETL cycle.

Our examination will conclude with a discussion of best practices, centering on coding style and deciding on when to solve a problem with M versus when to rely on DAX.

# Indexing Guidelines
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#621---Silicon-Valley-2017)
Event Date: 22-04-2017 - Session time: 17:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Greg Larsen
## Title: Indexing Guidelines
## Abstract:
### This session will discuss the indexes development lifecycle and some guidelines on how to make good indexing decisions.   By understanding the development lifecycle, you will better understand how to build and optimize your indexes over time.  We will also be discussing how to decide what columns to consider when building indexes, and how to ensure those indexes are providing value as your application matures.  Column selectivity will also be discussed.  This session will show how selectivity information can help you determine the best column order when building multi-column indexes.  During this session there will be numerous demos to highlight the concepts being discussed. Additionally, an indexing toolkit (a set of scripts) will be provided to help attendees better manage their indexes.

## Title: Why are you still taking backups?
## Abstract:
### Keep doing things the same way because they have always worked in the past is a very comfortable mistake we all make in many areas. That includes backup strategies and service account administration. In this one hour presentation full of demos I will explore many options available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure that can potentially reduce the amount of data and time required for backups and even eliminate the need all together. It sounds scary but it will be really fun.

## Speaker: Mike Lawell
## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.

## Title: Smart Re-Indexing - The quest of ultimate automation
## Abstract:
### How many times you have been called on weekends to handle a nightmare caused by Re-Indexing job? One of the most common aspect of performance tuning is a well-design dynamic index optimization process. If you ever wonder what it takes to design an efficient re-indexing process, which perform selective re-indexing, handles blocking automatically, avoid system downtime due to log disk full, automatically stop itself beyond a threshold, can be implemented across all sql servers regardless of application type or data size, in other words, fewer headaches. This session is for you!!

## Speaker: Milan Lee
## Title: Hybrid Cloud and On-Premise Environment for Model Development and Deployment
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce the model development and deployment capabilities that are integrated between SQL Server and the Microsoft Cloud Platform. We will demonstrate the model development process using Microsoft R Server on the Cloud, discuss some of the key differences between open source R and Microsoft R Server, and finally deploy the finished model into an on-premise instance of SQL Server for scoring and operationalization. No prior background in data science or model development is necessary.
