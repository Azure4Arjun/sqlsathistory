## Title: BI Office from Pyramid Analytics Delivering Better Decision for Everyone
## Abstract:
### Todayâ€™s organisations struggle to get measurable value from their business intelligence tools, preventing business agility, fragmenting data and risking gaps in their data security.

To become a data-driven organization, business leaders need more than overhyped productivity tools and analytic engines to make decisions. They need a thoughtfully designed platform that empowers everyone to make data an integral part of their day-to-day processes and decisions. They need an end-to-end solution that can bring together disparate data in a governed environment that allows users to easily model, discover, communicate, and distribute information.

For years now Business Intelligence products have forced organisations to make a choice between Governance and Scalability on the one hand or Agility and Self-Service on the other.  As a result, many Enterprises possess a patchwork quilt of Reporting, Dashboarding and Analysis tools creating multiple interpretations of the same underlying data.
