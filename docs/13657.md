## Speaker: Ed Elliott
## Title: Practical advice on how to get started using source control, ssdt and ci
## Abstract:
### Being more agile sounds like the right thing to do, unit testing, source control even SSDT should help to make us Sql Developers more productive and happier but how do we actually do it?

This is a talk about how to start with an existing database and drag it kicking and screaming into source control. 

We will cover what practical choices of IDE there are and how to use them to help, rather than hinder the development process.

In a nutshell, how do we become more agile on our Sql development!
