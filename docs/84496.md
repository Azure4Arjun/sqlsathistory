## Title: Containerized databases: SQL Server and DevOps
## Abstract:
### What are containers? When would you use them? Are they supported for production? Do they run on Windows? Do they run on Linux? Can they persist data?

These are just a few of the questions we will answer in this session. Containers are all the rage today - don't get left behind!
