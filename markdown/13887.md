## Title: Unit Testing Fundamentals 
## Abstract:
### How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? "Real" developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quickly ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll then introduce the tSQLt framework to run our test suite as well as SQL Test from RedGate.
