## Title: Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility
## Abstract:
### How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.
