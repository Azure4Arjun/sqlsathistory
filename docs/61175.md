## Title: CortanaAnalytics : with RaspberryPI  WeatherSensor
## Abstract:
### Cortana Analytics delivers an end-to-end platform with an integrated and comprehensive set of tools and services to help users to build intelligent applications. This session will show how Cortana can be used for monitoring live data collected from devices like weather sensors  and how we can use Cortana intelligence suit to monitor the live data and apply some machine learning process on them. In this Demo I will show how to set up an IoT device like Raspberry PI, how to use different components of Cortana Intelligence suite  for transferring data (Azure service bus and azure stream analytics), storing data in a azure SQL database, getting insights from collected data using azure ML,  and finally showing the results through  automatically in Power BI.
