## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart wi/SSIS - Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.
