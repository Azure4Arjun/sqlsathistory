## Title: An Artistic Dimwit Learns Data Visualisation
## Abstract:
### PowERBI goes Bananas

I'm scared of visualisations and I wanted to fix it. This is a talk by an artistic dimwit who is quite good at data.  

With a Trello-based Kanban board* as my muse and PowerBI as my canvass, I built a series of progressively less bad visualisations until I felt like an artist.

As with all art, you be the judge.
