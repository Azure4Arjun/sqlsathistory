## Title: Why Solidity is Solid – Basics of Ethereum, Smart Contracts, and Blockchain.
## Abstract:
### If you are into Ethereum or any latest Blockchain platform you may know the availability of “smart contract language (SCL)” comes easily. In this foundational quick talk, I will be introducing my audiences to a newer coding platform in Blockchain. We know that any RELATIONAL language/platform is legacy and solid when it comes to prevalence. But if you are open to experiment and broaden your understanding to a Blockchain world with the new-cutting-age-y languages, feel free to join my session. 
Topics that I will cover in this session – 
1.	What is Ethereum Blockchain (A, B, Cs of it.)
2.	Overview of NEO platform  Solidity language
3.	What are ‘Smart Contracts’
4.	Python, C++ Vs Solidity, Language of Smart Contract
5.	Last but not least, if you attend my session and do NOT understand ‘a thing’ I am speaking; you will still get a ton of ‘reference materials’ that I have been gaining from many over-priced Blockchain courses conducted by multi-millionaires, geeks.
