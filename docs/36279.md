## Title: Who needs SSAS when you've got SQL?
## Abstract:
### For SQL and .NET developers, Analysis Services may seem foreign or unnecessary, but it can offer many advantages for reporting and data exploration. In this session, we will cover useful features of SSAS and discuss conditions where it is beneficial. Next we'll compare the two types of Analysis Services databases (Multidimensional and Tabular) and cover how to decide which type is right for your solution. Then we will explore common ways to retrieve data and browse your SSAS database such as Excel, Power BI, SSRS, and custom .NET applications.
