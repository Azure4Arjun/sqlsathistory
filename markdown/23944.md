## Title: Unit Testing made easy for Database Development  
## Abstract:
### Though most developers agree that unit testing plays an important role in software development, to ensure quality and meet milestones, most developers write unit tests only as an afterthought. Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) helps to mainstream Test Driven Development methodology (TDD) into world of database development.  Unit testing presents a unique challenge in Database development, because of the need to provide a consistent test environment.
In this session, we will not only cover the basis of unit testing concepts and terminology, but also discuss how unit testing helps ensure and document the quality and accuracy of database deliverables. We will run through a demo of creating and running database unit tests using VSTS 2010.
