## Speaker: Emanuele Meazzo
## Title: How to use PowerBI as a free monitoring tool (including 5 free reports for SQL Server)
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a business analytics service that delivers insights to enable fast, informed decisions; we'll use it as an (improper) free monitoring tool.
Being at SQL Saturday, we'll focus on SQL Server Reports, but the methodology is system-agnostic and will enable you to create a monitoring report for anything.

In the first part of the session, you'll learn why we're using PowerBI for such task and what are the limitations, explaining the PowerBI basics, architecture and components.

In the second part, we'll analyze 5 examples of ready-to-go and license free monitoring reports tailored for SQL Server:

- FirstRespondersKit Monitoring Dashboard
- Xevents Dashboard to track query errors
- Job Information Dashboard
- Permission Information Dashboard
- Streaming DataSet

This will give you both some reports that you can start to use right now, and the inspiration to build your own.
