## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Defy the Defaults!
## Abstract:
### Installing SQL Server is easy, right? You just insert the install media, click Next a bunch of times, and you'll have a working database server in just a few minutes. At least that's what many of our non-DBA colleagues think. Not so fast, says veteran DBA Mike Hillwig. SQL Server has lots of default settings that can be potential performance killers, and we'll look at a bunch of them. These include things like where data files live, data file growth, basic security settings, and the services being installed. And while we're at it, we'll look at a bunch of the good defaults and talk about why they shouldn't be touched.
