## Title: Flash 101- An Introduction to Flash Storage for MS SQL Server and Data Centers
## Abstract:
### More CPU/more Memory/More Spindles’  has been the mantra for increasing performance for SQL Server environments that are resource bound.  This often leads to complicated file placements,  complicated lun/disk striping, complex partitioning schemes and creative resource handling.  Storage has been the last area of hardware technology that has improved performance for enterprise systems,  but now the next generation of storage is here… Flash, and its available and practical for database systems.
