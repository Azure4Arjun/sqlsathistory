## Title: Getting to and Nailing Your Interviews
## Abstract:
### Are you stuck in your existing job for years? Do you feel you need to get out, try either a new company or a new role; or even a new boss? This a very entertaining and highly interactive session is perfect for you. I promise, you'll walk out of it totally reassured and enlightened.

In this session I'll share my and other people's real stories and the techniques about keeping abreast the job market and finding new opportunities. 

We'll also talk about normal mistakes that people make when they are cozy in a job. 
But, what do we do once we get that rare opportunity to interview. 

We must take care of :
1. Overall appearance
2. Food habits on the eve of the interview
3. Postures
4. Arrival
5. During the interview
6, Closing
7. Follow up
8. Maintaining interview logs

Keep going at it. Never stop looking!!!
