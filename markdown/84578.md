## Title: A Whistle stop Tour of Microsoft SQL Server and Azure BI Offerings
## Abstract:
### Get ready for a wild ride as we identify  discuss the combination of Microsoft technologies which make up the “Data territory”, the offerings for BI/DW/Data Science practitioners. Some parts of the territory are ripe w/opportunity while other less-discovered parts are a bit hostile.

We’ll leave the engine running at each stop but spend enough time for the passengers to understand exactly what the various components mean. Throughout the tour, we’ll talk to the applicability of the components based on sizes of data (and customer). 

At journey’s end, the attendee will want to take action and their own path into Microsoft “Data Territory”.

Learnings:	
Attendees will have a more complete view of Microsoft’s SQL Server and Azure BI “Data Platform” offerings
Attendees can expect to be whisked into aspects of the Microsoft Offerings they may have never heard of or understood.
Attendees should be able to correlate the various Microsoft offerings to the size and scope of their own projects
