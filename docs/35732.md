## Title: Ask the CEO - Infrastructure for your new business
## Abstract:
### Want to start a new business? You have the great idea, but what about creating a business plan, web site, invoicing, CRM, social media and all the other infrastructure you need to operate that great startup. Come and spend an hour with me and see how we did it with our new company Effektor.  Ask all the questions you have. I might even be able to answer them.
