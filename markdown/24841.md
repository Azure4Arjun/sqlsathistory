## Speaker: Scott Shaw
## Title: Cubicle to Consulting
## Abstract:
### What you do for a living may say a lot about who you are. No where is this as true as in IT. How you learn, how you grow, your passions, and your goals can all be reflected in your job. There are many ways your skills can be delivered and you need to choose the best fit for who you are. This session aims to take an unbiased look at the difference between working in a solid, stable IT environment or trekking out and offering your skills as an IT consultant. The differences are staggering and each has their risks and rewards. Each role has its own myths and, like most myths, some are true and some are not. This session will draw on real-world experience and won't hesitate to point out the successes as well as the failures.
