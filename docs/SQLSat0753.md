# Create Stunning Visualizations with The Help of R
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#753---Lviv-2018)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: Create Stunning Visualizations with The Help of R
## Abstract:
### R is the first choice for data scientists for a good reason: besides accessing and transforming data and applying statistical methods and models to it, it has a wide variety of possibilities to visualize data. As visual perception of data is the key to understanding data, this capability is crucial. This session will give you a broad overview over available packages and diagram types you can build with them on the one hand, and a deep dive into common visualizations and their possibilities on the other hand. Impress yourself and your peers with stunning visualizations which will give you insights into data you could not achieve with other tools of Microsoft’s BI stack.

# Database tuning advisor vs. dynamic management views
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#753---Lviv-2018)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Torsten Strauss
## Title: Database tuning advisor vs. dynamic management views
## Abstract:
### Query tuning is a challenging task for a developer and database administrator - so how can we achieve this?

SQL Server mainly offers two different tools we can use for this purpose: DTA Database Tuning Advisor and Missing Index Dynamic Management Views.
But what are the differences in terms of reliability, usage, limitations and tuning recommendations?
So, we will try to answer these questions in this deep dive session (300-400).

## Abstract:
### Everthing is connected. Everything is accessible. Everything is hackable.
This is a security "worst" practices session for developers (yes, yes, the boring "best" practices are also included).
As always, should you or any of your colleagues be hacked or exploited, the Demo Gods will disavow any knowledge of the speakers' actions. This session will self-destruct in 60 minutes. Luck has nothing to do with it, Jim…

Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Grzegorz Stolecki
## Title: Predictive Reporting Services Performance Monitoring
## Abstract:
### Every user wants to have his/hers reports generated quickly. But reality isn't so cute. Sometimes you have to wait and wait, and wait again while looking at the rotating green circle.
During my session you will learn how to monitor Reporting Services with the Execution Log.  I will show the structure of the log and some useful queries to get precise insights into report generating process. Analysing the log gives you a quick way to find bottlenecks and sources of your problems. Especially when you use a tool like Power BI or Excel to create a functional dashboard. You also will learn how to use R powered models in Power BI to predict problems with your reports execution.

# SQL Server Performance Tuning Nowadays
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#753---Lviv-2018)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Denis Reznik
## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning Nowadays
## Abstract:
### Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in a process of performance tuning. 

In this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way, we will learn performance tuning practical techniques and solve a bunch of issues in real-time. And despite I'm a big fan of Profiler and old-fashioned tools and technics, new, more interesting and useful instruments are available nowadays, so will use them to find the bottleneck and tune performance. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.

## Title: Dynamic Search Conditions
## Abstract:
### A common requirement in database applications is that users want a function to search a set of data from a large set of possible search conditions. The challenge is to implement such searches in a way that is both maintenanble and efficient in terms of performance. This session looks at the two main techniques to implement such searches and highlights their strengths and limitaitons.

# ДБА мимоволі – що робити? (українською)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#753---Lviv-2018)
Event Date: 29-09-2018 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Yevhen Nedashkivskyi
## Title: ДБА мимоволі – що робити? (українською)
## Abstract:
### Часто роль адміністратора баз даних закріплюється за принципом «може розібратися і має на це час», а іноді і просто ігнорується. На жаль, це призводить до проблем з продуктивністю, необгрунтованих витрат на обладнання, ризику втрати даних і простою основної діяльності.

Доповідач, в стислій, але доступній формі на прикладі СУБД Microsoft SQL Server розповість і покаже, що необхідно робити новоспеченим адміністраторам баз даних, навіть якщо ця роль дісталася їм мимоволі.

У цій сесії:

1. Планування
2. Інсталяція і налаштування
3. Регулярне обслуговування
4. Проблеми з продуктивністю і як їх вирішити
5. Масштабування
6. Побудова стратегії відновлення від збоїв
7. Сторонні утиліти і інструменти

Доповідь призначений для широкої кола в тому числі і для тих, хто не має досвіду в адмініструванні баз даних, а також тим, кому роль ДБА дісталася за сумісництвом.

Українською мовою.

## Speaker: Vitalii Bondarenko
## Title: Data Migration Project for over 200 TB: Pre-sale, Architecture, PoC and Delivery
## Abstract:
### We would like to describe a data migration project for Law Company from UK. 500M documents in more than 20 offices around the world were migrated from a legacy Document Management System to a new one. As the result, in total, over 200 TB of data were extracted, transferred, reshaped and loaded. The session will start from specifics of a pre-sale process, than cover in details "As Is" and "To Be" architecture, show the results of a PoC, which was done in Azure Cloud and finally describe delivery and results. During the presentation we will focus on specific aspects of Data Migration projects, scalability, security, etc. Also will discus several difficulties we dialed with. The session contains lots of architectural diagrams and examples of code.
