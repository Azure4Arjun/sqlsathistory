## Title: Isolation Levels: Improving Performance Through Concurrency
## Abstract:
### Support for multiple simultaneous operations is a key feature of database systems, but there are many ways this can be implemented. This session explores the different isolation levels supported by SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. It will cover what they are, how they work, the issues they address, and how they differ. We will also investigate In-Memory OLTP and what it offers. Demonstrations will show how isolation level configuration can affect both the performance and result set returned by a query. Additionally, attendees will learn how to choose the optimal isolation level for a given workload, and will see how easy it can be to improve performance by adjusting isolation settings. Proper use of isolation levels can help relieve bottlenecks that no amount of query tuning or indexing can address - attend this session and gain Senior DBA-level skills on how to maximize your database's ability to process transactions concurrently.
