## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: Power BI Architecture
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a cloud service that lets you share, collaborate and access your Excel reports anywhere on any device. In this session, you will learn how to create data models, display visualizations, and synchronize cloud data with on premises data sources. In order to use these new features, you will continue to leverage existing skillsets, such as Tabular, Power Pivot, DAX, and you will be able to connect to database and semantic models you already built, such as existing databases in Analysis Services Multidimensional and Tabular. The goal is to create dashboards leveraging data and models that you have both on cloud and on premises.
