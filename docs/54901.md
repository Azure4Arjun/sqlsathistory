## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
## Abstract:
### High-end storage is expensive, and SQL Server data compression can make your database smaller. So compress all the tables! 

No--unfortunately, it's not that easy. We'll talk about how data compression actually works, and the differences between ROW and PAGE compression. As part of this, we'll look at the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.
