## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes For Data Analytics
## Abstract:
### The concept of convenience typically involves ease of use and/or the ability to get results fast while maintaining quality and integrity.  The industry of business intelligence and data analytics has been changing and evolving with this same concept in mind. 

The traditional data warehouse includes various implementation and development phases that can be both costly and time consuming to architect.  Although a viable solution for analytics based on query speed and performance, one of the biggest drawbacks is data latency from the OLTP engine to the OLAP engine.  First introduced in SQL Server 2012, Columnstore indexes have made great strides in SQL Server 2016.

In this session, we will cover the architecture of columnstore indexes compared to traditional B-tree indexes.  We will look at specific use case scenarios and performance statistics to understand if columnstore indexes can be your solution for data analytics with or without a traditional data warehouse.
