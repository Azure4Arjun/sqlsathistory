## Title: Delayed durability from an application perspective
## Abstract:
### Transactions durability is topic that is not commonly discussed, SQL Server 2014 brings a new feature called delayed durability, this provides greater management capabilities over your transactions and application modules. We will highlight how to implement delayed transactions at the database and transaction level, and also how this could eventually impact your application performance.We will discuss possible use cases and check with a demo using .Net enterprise library and the logging block, and monitor to see the difference of behavior of a full durable transaction vrs a delayed durable.
