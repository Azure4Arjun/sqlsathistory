## Title:  Introduction to Graphical Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### In this introductory level session, which is designed for DBAs with little or no knowledge of query execution plans, you will learn why execution plans are important, how they are created, learn about the different execution plan formats, discover different ways to produce them, find out about the difference between estimated and actual execution plans, and most importantly, learn the basics of how to read and interpret graphical execution plans. This includes taking a look at ten of the most commonly used execution plan operators, and finding out exactly what they mean.
