## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Intro Into Index Analysis
## Abstract:
### Indexing in SQL Server is both - art and science. It is also never-ending process. Database schema, queries and workload change overtime, making old indexing strategy obsolete and leaving you with inefficient or unused indexes.  

In this session, Dmitri demonstrates several techniques that help you to perform index analysis in the system. You would learn how to detect unused and inefficient indexes, identify incorrect clustered indexes and choose the right candidates for consolidation and further index refactoring.
