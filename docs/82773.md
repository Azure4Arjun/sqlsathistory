## Title: Image classification with Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit
## Abstract:
### Artificial intelligence is called electricity of the 21st century. 150 years ago the invention of electricity changed our whole world. Today, thanks to AI, we are facing a revolution on a similar scale.
This breakthrough was possible due to use of deep learning models for such tasks as image and film classification, sound recognition and natural language processing. All of these skills that people come naturally are relatively difficult to machines. Only a combination of three factors: a large amount of available training data, blazing fast computers and innovative deep learning algorithms allowed computers to see, hear and understand colloquial language.
During this session we will learn the principle of deep learning models for visual recognition, starting from linear models and model hyperparameters, through general neural networks, to convolutional neural networks. All this theory will be augment by examples â€” we will build and compare different models using Cognitive Toolkit.
