# SQLSaturday #972 – Belo Horizonte – Virtual 2020
Event Date: 24-10-2020 - Session time: 01:00:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: André Melancia
## Title: Cosmos DB: An Azure Odyssey
## Abstract:
### In the vast IT Universe, there are two dominant types of particles: the SQL electron and the NoSQL positron. Everyone has seen SQL, but not many have seen NoSQL, or even understand it.
Spark your imagination in an IT Universe where replication works at a magical quantum level, and .Net planets coexist with Cosmos DB star clusters.
Disclaimer: Mixing SQL electrons with NoSQL positrons may lead to the destruction of the known universe. Doing it right however, you can create the brightest supernovas!
