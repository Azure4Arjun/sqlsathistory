## Title: Five Easy Pieces
## Abstract:
### It's story time. I explore 5 unrelated recent production episodes I tackled. For each issue, I explain the troubleshooting methods I used, the data I collected, the plan I made and the actions I took. DBAs or DB Developers in attendance will learn about data gathering methods and quick troubleshooting tricks. You'll learn the easy way some lessons I learned the hard way.
