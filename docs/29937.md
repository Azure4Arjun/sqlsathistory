## Title: Database  Antipatterns
## Abstract:
### We've all seen them.  We've commiserated with one another about them over coffee at conferences and in blog sites.  Bad database design is much more common than good database design.  This discussion will cover a few of the most prominent "Antipatterns" common to database design today.
