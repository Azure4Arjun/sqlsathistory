## Abstract:
### This session will provide an overview of what PerformancePoint is, where it came from, and how do you get it.  We will also discuss whatâ€™s changed in the 2010 release (including with the latest SP1 update).  Along with this we will go over the Dashboard Designer tool showing you how to install it and explain what it is used for.  Then hold on to your seats, I will build out and deploy a fully functional and interactive dashboard.  Along the way I will provide insight from the trenches including tips and tricks along with experience from client deployments.
