## Title: What is hidden in the query plan ?
## Abstract:
### In the last versions of SQL Server, new information is hidden in the query plan, like memory allocation, wait info or statistics used to estimate the cardinality. In this session, we will open the query plan in XML and with Plan Explorer, and we will discuss what these additions mean and how then can help you improving your queries.
