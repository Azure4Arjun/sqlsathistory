## Title: Aligning IT and the Business
## Abstract:
### No matter how fast business moves, thereâ€™s no substitute for a smart, carefully crafted IT plan that is aligned with your business strategy. Join Sparkhound Principal Consultant Tim Goedeke as he discusses his experiences as a fractional CIO, challenged with helping IT fulfill its role as a strategic business partner for speed to market, product / service differentiation and superior end-user experience delivery. Are you ready to eliminate perceptions of IT as a cost center, and paint the vision of IT as a business driver?
