## Title: SQL 2008 Change Data Capture Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the very best features of SQL Server 2008. It's is easy to set up and it essentially makes the transaction logs for your databases both persistent and queryable. Versioning your data has never been easier. But there are dozens of tools for tuning and reporting on CDC that are either undocumented or "loosely" documented by Microsoft. During this session, Brock will show you 20 tips and tricks for making your CDC implementations much richer and easier to maintain.
