## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: Database corrupt! Whatâ€™s next?
## Abstract:
### Corruption happens! Realize that! Do not just cross your fingers, you have choices to save your data. When corruption occurs pressing the panic button is not an option, but knowing what exactly to do in order to minimize a data loss and down time. Backups are sometimes the best way to minimize the data loss, but not necessarily the down-time. The session explains what to do when corruption occurs in order to reduce data loss and downtime, how to act proactively minimizing corruption. Having this knowledge can make DBAs more confident to dealing these problems themselves and improve their skills
