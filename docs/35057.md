## Title: ASP.NET Dynamic Data Web Application
## Abstract:
### This session will go over the new Dynamic Data Web Application available with the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions. 

Using Visual Studio 2008 we will build our model using LINQ TO SQL. Then we will see how easy it is to create a website based on our model that easily allows you to edit the data in your tables.

We're also going to look under the hood at what type of TSQL is generated from our LINQ TO SQL class.
