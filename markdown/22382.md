## Title: Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts
## Abstract:
### Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language).
