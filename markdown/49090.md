## Title: Unicorn safari - alleviating consolidation pains with SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Database consolidation was once described to me as a bit of a mix between the holy grail and a unicorn. Not that difficult in theory, but have a way of getting very messy in practice. SQL Server 2016 brings several new features to simplify the whole process, and hopefully provide the DBA and the people footing the license bill some sorely needed respite.
This presentation will outline the classic issues with consolidation of small and medium-sized databases and explore what new pain relief SQL Server 2016 brings to the table.
At the end of this session you will have a good understanding of the challenges and solutions available in SQL Server for solving consolidation workloads.
