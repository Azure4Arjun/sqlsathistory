## Title: Using Oracle GoldenGate to Replicate SQL Server Data
## Abstract:
### Some people think of Oracle and SQL Server as mutually exclusive. In my experience many SQL Server customers use Oracle products to enhance their SQL Server databases because of replication challenges as well as enhanced security. Some of Oracleâ€™s products, such as Oracle GoldenGate, Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, Database Firewall and Audit Vault can greatly enhance Microsoft SQL Server.

This presentation covers the basics of what Oracle GoldenGate is, how it works with Microsoft SQL
Server and a few case studies on how it has enhanced some large SQL Server installations. GoldenGate is a heterogeneous replication project. It can be used to migrate data between various databases as well as different versions of the same database product. It can be used for database upgrades and migrations, loading data warehouses and data lakes and a number of other purposes.
This presentation will introduce you to Oracle GoldenGate, its uses and how to use it.
