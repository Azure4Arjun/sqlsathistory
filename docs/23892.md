## Speaker: Sam Mesel
## Title: TempDB Internals â€“ part I
## Abstract:
### TempDB is a central resource for all systems and for SQL Server engine itself. A non-optimally designed system can make heavy use of TempDB, which will become the bottleneck of SQL Server
This session will discuss TempDB properties and characteristics, we will cover SQL Server startup process and its dependencies on TempDB, options and settings that can be configured, and trace flags that can be used.
The session will then put focus into User Objects, i.e., objects created explicitly by T-SQL code (temporary tables, table variables, temporary stored procedures, and so forth.. ). 
Tools and code Techniques will be shown to monitor and minimize impact on TempDB.
This session is heavily based on demos
