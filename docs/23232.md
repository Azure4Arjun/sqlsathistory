## Speaker: Robert Hatton
## Title: Thinking in SQL
## Abstract:
### Experienced craftsmen can produce works of a much higher quality than a lay person could. They can usually accomplish this feat more quickly than lay folk can too. It's not necessarily because the craftsmen have better dexterity or strength than most people, it's because they understand an effective way to think about their craft.

Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at.
