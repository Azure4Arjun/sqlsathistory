## Title: XML and JSON deep dive
## Abstract:
### In the modern world of information technology, keeping data stored and manipulated reliably
and efficiently is one of the top priorities. Within the last decade, SQL Server has evolved into a
sophisticated Enterprise RDBMS tool, and it is still growing by providing more functionalities to store
and manipulate data reliably. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is one of the technologies that SQL
Server implements not only for data manipulation but also for internal usage, such as Execution Plans,
Extended Events, DDL trigger Eventdata() function, and behind-the- scenes construction for SQL Server
Business Intelligence Tools (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS). XML skills often appear in SQL Server DBA job
requirements because the ability to work with XML allow the DBA to be faster and more efficient when
solving different types of problems.
