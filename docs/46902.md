## Title: 20 Minute Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Are you familiar w/ SSAS Multidimensional and curious about Tabular? Having trouble deciding between cubes and tabular models? Then this is your session!

Analysis Services Tabular was introduced back in 2012, and yet it has only just started to emerge from the Proof-Of-Concept phase to a legitimate production alternative in most IT departments. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models provide considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. And with major advancements in 2016, Tabular has never been a more appealing solution. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a Tabular model.
