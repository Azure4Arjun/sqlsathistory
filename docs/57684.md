## Title: Help! My Replication Has Fallen and I Cant Get it Replicating again.
## Abstract:
### The audience will be presented with a number of broken-down replication scenarios and they will hunt down the cause of each failure and find ways to correct the problem and/or prevent it from happening again. Through out the adventure the various replication types will be discussed and pro-active methods of monitoring and fault tolerances will be discussed.
