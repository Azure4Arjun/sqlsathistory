## Title: Use PowerShell and SQLCMD - be more effective
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is a relatively new scripting environment from Microsoft and SQLCMD is a replacement of OSQL. Every day we perform many similar database-related tasks. Why not write once and then reuse that code multiple times? I will give an overview of Powershell and SQLCMD. Then we will see how to use them in SQL Server environment to automate repetitive tasks, write a flexible code, perform tasks while away from the computer, and perform many other time-saving activities.
