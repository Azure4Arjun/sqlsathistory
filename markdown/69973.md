## Speaker: Ronald Dameron
## Title: Uptight Database Security
## Abstract:
### Do you work for an institution that fears itâ€™s DBAs could go rogue on their production databases? 
Do you want to revoke continuous sysadmin permissions from your DBA team in an attempt to avoid being the next WikiLeak? 
Do you have concerns that the DBA team is querying sensitive databases?
Then, you need Uptight Database Security. 
Come to this session to learn how to deploy a configurable permission model that provides on-demand access to SQL Server databases. This model allows DBAs to do routine work without sysadmin, elevate permissions to sysadmin only during production emergencies or disaster recovery scenarios. Attendees  will leave this session with the fundamental knowledge and scripts to implement a low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain a production database server.
