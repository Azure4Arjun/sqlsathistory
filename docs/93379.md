## Title: SSMS to Azure Data Studio: The Big Switch
## Abstract:
### We've used SSMS to interact with SQL Server instances since 2005. Now, Microsoft is provides us with something new - Azure Data Studio.

I'm starting to use Azure Data Studio over SSMS where possible, and this talk is meant to share my experience with others. Azure Data Studio is certainly different, and it offers some interesting and impressive new ways to interact with our SQL Server instances.
