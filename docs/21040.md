## Title: SQL Server Table Partitioning from the Ground Up
## Abstract:
### In this session we will be looking at the SQL Server table partitioning features which were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  We will look at how to create partitioned tables and indexes as well as the internals of the table.  We will also look at how to move data from one partition to another and from one table to another with minimal to no impact to the users.

Using these techniques we will be able to improve query performance and reduce downtime when loading and pruning data.
