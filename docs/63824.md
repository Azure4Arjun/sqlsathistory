## Title: Azure SQL Data Warehouse - The next generation of data warehousing
## Abstract:
### Learn about Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW) which is a fully managed elastic database built for data warehouse workloads from a few hundred gigabytes to petabytes of data. It has truly unique features like disaggregated compute and storage allowing customers to be able to utilize the service to match their diverse needs. In this session, we take a look at the architecture of SQL DW and features such as elastic scale (grow, shrink, and pause) and Polybase and how you take advantage of them for your data warehousing solution.
