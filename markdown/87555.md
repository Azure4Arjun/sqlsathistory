## Title: Can really Naming Convention and standards save your environment
## Abstract:
### Are you managing your "chaos" environment but still can't move forward to start improvements and automation successfully?

Do you really know how is your SQL instance, permissions and servers configured and why you are still missing strong and persistence naming structure and standards? 

This session will be focusing on the Naming convention and standards in the infrastructure environment and how to apply it correctly, which also includes SQL Database objects.
