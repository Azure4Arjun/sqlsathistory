## Title: Windows PowerShell for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### Windows PowerShell is becoming the scripting language of choice for managing Microsoft servers and workstations. And while T-SQL is still the scripting language for DBAs to administer and manage SQL Server, there are tons of stuff that can be easily done with Windows PowerShell.

In this session, learn Windows PowerShell from the ground up and how you can use it with SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) to administer and manage a SQL Server instance.
