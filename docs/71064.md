## Title: Data Hoarding (Buried Alive):  Better Data Modeling and Management When Using Power BI
## Abstract:
### Microsoftâ€™s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves as well as the organization at a fast pace has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?

Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and modeling.

In this session, we will look at potential data management nightmares that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.
