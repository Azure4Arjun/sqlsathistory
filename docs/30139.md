Event Date: 24-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS
## Speaker: Eric Wisdahl
## Title: SSIS Data Flow Buffer Breakdown
## Abstract:
### This session will examine the different types of data flow components, execution trees, data buffers, performance metrics and logging mechanisms. In determining how the buffers are built and used, the developer will begin to understand if, how and why package performance will be impacted when new transformations or columns are added. The developer will further learn how to capture performance metrics to identifiably track these impacts. Finally, the session will take a look at the controls and effects of parallel package and parallel task execution.
