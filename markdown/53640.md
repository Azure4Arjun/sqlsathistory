## Title: Creating an Always On Distributed Availability Group
## Abstract:
### Always On has developed and matured into an effective HA/DR solution with SQL 2016.  Most enterprise DBAs have built a cluster and installed Always On Availability Groups (AOAG), this session will take the Always On technology one step further and discuss the new features in SQL 2016 that will allow a DBA to have live, read only database replicas in a geographically diverse location, in a completely different domain cluster and as a member of a completely separate Availability Group (AG).  This session will go through the steps of identifying the pre-requisites, limitations and installation steps to setup a Distributed Availability Group from start to finish! Come and watch how to do it!
