# Querying NoSQL with SQL: HAVING Your JSON Cake and SELECTing it too
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-948)
Event Date: 16-05-2020 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Matthew Groves
## Title: Querying NoSQL with SQL: HAVING Your JSON Cake and SELECTing it too
## Abstract:
### Until recently, agile business had to choose between the benefits of JSON-based NoSQL databases and the benefits of SQL-based querying. NoSQL provides schema flexibility, high performance, and elastic scaling, while SQL provides expressive, independent data access. Recent convergence allows developers and organizations to have the best of both worlds.

Developers need to deliver apps that readily evolve, perform, and scale, all to match changing business needs. Organizations need rapid access to their operational data, using standard analytical tools, for insight into their business. In this session, you will learn the ways that SQL can be applied to NoSQL databases, and what additional features are needed to deal with JSON documents. SQL for JSON, JSON data modeling, indexing, and tool integration will be covered. This session will focus mainly on CosmosDb and Couchbase, but it will also touch on emerging relational approaches to JSON data.

# Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-948)
Event Date: 16-05-2020 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Eugene Meidinger
## Title: Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
## Abstract:
### When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Navigating Today's Azure SQL Services
## Abstract:
### Five years ago there was a limited number of ways to deploy and use the SQL Server engine in the Azure Cloud. Today, there are many different services that one can choose.

How do you determine which service to use?

In this presentation we focus on key attributes of your data to pick the correct service. Certain services have limits on size, performance and movability of database. Other factors, such as the budget of your project, may also come into the decision making.

Transferring a database to the cloud is usually the easiest part of the project. Scheduling batch processes, executing maintenance jobs and providing alerts is usually part of the DBA equation. For companies that have a large amount of ETL packages, a lift and shift of this code might be a consideration. Other companies are more security conscious which means auditing, compliance, and threat detection are key factors in the decision.

At the end of the presentation, the attendee will have a broad knowledge of the Azure SQL services and when to apply each to a given project.

## Title: SARGability: The Case of the Unused Index
## Abstract:
### I just wrote some tSQL code, and made a perfect index!  But wait, it's still slow and it's not being used!  Why not?
We're going to take a look at indexes and how they work, and then do a deeper dive into the ways we write our code that will not allow it to use those wonderful indexes. Participants will come out with a deeper understanding of indexes and yet more coding anti-patterns to avoid!

## Title: Real World Use Cases Utilizing DbaTools.IO
## Abstract:
### If you have been anywhere near the SQL community in the past year, you have heard of this cool new toolset call DBAtools. DBAtools is set of PowerShell commands that will help make every DBA's (including the accidental DBA's) life easier. With just a few piece of information, you can manage and report on your SQL instances, from one to many, with ease. This session is a quick overview of what DBAtools is, some of the things you can do with it, and then some real world examples that are taken from our daily uses. Our objective is that when you leave this session, you will be comfortable reporting on your instances, and be prepared to take the next steps, AUTOMATION!!

## Title: When to use indexing pro features
## Abstract:
### Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy.

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning.

We'll cover an overview of what each of these options are, and then dive into some code examples to see how and when each of these work, and when the don't.

You will leave the session with a much better idea of how and when to use each of these special indexing flavors to meet your needs.
