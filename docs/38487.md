## Title: Azure SQL Database - Is it right for my organization?
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database is now based on the same bits as SQL Server 2014, bringing great enterprise capabilities.  We will discuss business continuity features such as geo restore, point-in-time recoveries, and how to recover a deleted database with only a few clicks.  No more retrieving tapes from you off-site backup vault!  Learn how easy it is to configure a geo-replicated solution which allows for both disaster recovery and readable secondaries. Use the built-in SQL Server Management Studio wizard to migrate your on-premises databases into Azure SQL Database.
