## Title: Taming the T-Log
## Abstract:
### This session will give a brief overview of the many facets of the transaction log.  Explore how the different recovery models play into the behavior of the transaction log.  We will see what taking the different types of backups do to the transaction log.  Explore alerts and scripts to monitor the transaction log.  We will explore all this to hopefully help us tame our transaction logs, or at least to better understand why it is the way it is.
