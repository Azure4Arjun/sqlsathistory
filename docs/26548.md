## Speaker: Ben Thul
## Title: Back(up) to Basics
## Abstract:
### Are your databases being backed up? Are you sure? Are you sure they're being backed up correctly? Maybe you're an "accidental DBA" or a developer who's not quite sure of the answers to those questions. In this session, you'll learn what the different types of basic backups are, how to execute them, and (perhaps most importantly) how to restore from them if and when necessary.
