## Speaker: David Bermingham
## Title: Making sense of SQL Server availability options
## Abstract:
### With more mission critical databases being deployed in VMs, availability options for SQL Server have grown immensely.  Clustering, vMotion, Live Migration, HA, FT, database mirroring and more.  Who is responsible to ensure your database is available 24 x 7?  Is it the DBA?  Is it the server team?  Maybe it is the virtualization team?  Maybe it is a joint decision among all of those teams.  Regardless of who is ultimately responsible, this session will give you a great understanding of the options available and what they do and do not protect against to ensure the availability of your database.
