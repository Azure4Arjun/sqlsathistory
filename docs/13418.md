## Title: SQL Server Security 101
## Abstract:
### SQL Server security sound simple.  We grant permissions to people and processes that need access to our SQL Server instances and databases, while controlling which data they can access and what actions they can perform.
    However, behind this simple statement lies much complexity.  In practice, it is easy for the novice database administrator to get lost in the hierarchy of principals, securables and permissions that comprise the SQL Server security architecture.  The most common result is the path of least resistance, where people end up with "too many privileges."  
    My primary goals are to provide a simple, concise description of how the SQL Server permission hierarchy works, and then demonstrate, step by step, how to implement the "Principle of Least Privilege" in securing SQL Server.  
    I will also mention security-related items that are new to SQL Server 2014.
