## Title: NoSQL- What is it and why do I care? 
## Abstract:
### NoSQL (or, more correctly NoRel) is a moniker applied to a family of non relational software systems for storing data and/or documents that powers some of the largest sites on the internet.  Amazingly enough, some of these platforms have been around a very long time. A high level discussion of some of the pros and cons of this technology compared to traditional systems like Oracle and SQL Server.  A survey of the most popular "NoSQL" platforms and who uses them.
