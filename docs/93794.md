## Title: He's Assertive, She's Aggressive: Recognizing patterns of unconscious bias in the workplace
## Abstract:
### Social science has shown that people tend classify one another by gender, race, or other physical characteristics and instinctively react based on stereotypes and cultural norms.  These automatic prejudices (often called unconscious bias) contribute to the disproportionate success of white men in STEM when compared to equally qualified women or minorities.  The difference between unconscious bias and intentional discrimination is that the people that participate in it are often motivated to end these behaviors when they're brought to their attention.

This discussion will cover some common patterns of unconscious bias that occur in the workplace and offer real, concrete actions to intervene as an employee, a manager, or an organization.
