## Title: CLR within SQL Server 2008 
## Abstract:
### Running .NET code within SQL Server 2008 has been a major controversy in the past couple of years. Do you allow it or not? What are the implications? Does this mean that the .NET developers can run amok in my database?!  Don’t miss out on a golden opportunity to implement this within your infrastructure because you simply don’t know the answers! This session will go over everything that you need to know in order to implement SQLCLR code within your database environment as well as showing you how to create your own user-defined functions, types, and aggregates. Along the way, I will show you some tips and tricks that will ensure you have a successful implementation.
