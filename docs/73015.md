## Title: Microservice-Pattern using Serverless-Architectur (Azure Functions)
## Abstract:
### Today there are microservices and all shapes and colors and one of the most favorite implementation of this pattern is by leveraging a containerized-architecture. There are many companies doing it already and there are a zillion blogs and online resources for this.
But since microservice is a pattern, it can actually be implemented using different architectures, like the serverless-architecture.
In this Session we’ll see how to implement this pattern using Azure Functions, Microsoft’s implementation of the serverless-architecture.
