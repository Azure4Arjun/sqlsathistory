## Title: Using Power BI in Enterprise: Collaboration Features
## Abstract:
### Power BI groups enable teams to collaborate on one set of Dashboards, Reports, and Datasets.
Organizations can create and publish content packs to their employees, leveraging data across on-premises and cloud data sources.
Groups and organizational content packs complement each other to create a powerful collaborative experience built on Office 365 groups. In this session, you will see how to use them effectively, making sure that the access security is always in place correctly.
