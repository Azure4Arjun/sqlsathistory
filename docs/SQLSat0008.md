## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: DBA Repository, 2008 SSRS Overlay and Gantt Chart
## Abstract:
### This idea delivers a series of SSRS 2008 reports added to the DBA Repository. One is a working Gantt chart for reporting on SQL Server Agent schedules.

This is vital to a DBA so that he or she can see when jobs overlap on all servers that may cause contention for resources.
