## Title: True Lies: How to create credible fake data
## Abstract:
### It's data science in reverse! Do you ever need a good large demonstration or benchmarking data set that isn’t off-limits?  After looking, I couldn’t find any good large data sets out there. So, I decided to make my own.  In this session, we will go through the process of creating believable dummy data that provides (fake) insight with real-world variability.  We’ll discuss where to find base information, how to make use of robust randomization, and some geographic coding concepts.
