## Title: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) – NetLib Security Encryptionizer vs. SQL Server
## Abstract:
### NetLib Security’s patented data security platform, Encryptionizer, provides Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and Column Encryption for all versions of SQL Server from 2000 through 2016, and for all editions SQL Server from Express through Enterprise. Encryptionizer’s TDE has virtually no impact on database performance.

Enterprise Manager (EEM) takes Encryptionizer for SQL Server to the next level, allowing you to easily administer from one central location while providing powerful centralized key management. An easy to deploy solution to protect, manage and defend your data while enabling the growing areas of compliance, EEM enables organizations of all sizes to configure and control their encryption needs across the enterprise – no matter where they reside geographically across physical, virtual or clouD. The administrator will be able to easily control key management to meet the new PCI compliance standards. From EEM you can encrypt databases and secure SQL Server instances.
