## Title: A Modern SQL Server DBA...In 10 Minutes
## Abstract:
### If you're a new DBA, or an experienced DBA who's a few years behind, you are probably overwhelmed by all the fancy new terms and features: Azure/Cloud/On-Premises, Power Shell/Query/Pivot/View/Map/BI, Availability Groups, In-Memory/Hekaton, Columnstore, Everything-As-A-Service, and even having to deal with the dreaded NoSQL! And you've still got your hands full with clustering, mirroring, replication and backups! What is a modern SQL Server DBA to do?

This lightning talk will offer a gentle guide to all that new-fangled stuff and show you how they can make your current tasks easier and better. You'll learn where to find help and best practices, and how to get started with SQL Server in Azure. We'll also cover Microsoft Virtual Labs and show you how you can get hands-on experience with no risk or cost to you. 

You'll laugh, you'll smile, and most of all you'll feel a lot better about all these new features and how to get the most out of them.
