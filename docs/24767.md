## Title: From SQL Traces to Extended Events. The next big switch.
## Abstract:
### This session will give you insight into both of the current tracing technologies in SQL Server with emphasis on Extended Events.

The old SQL Trace which has served us well over the past 10 or so years is on its way out because the overhead and details it produces are no longer enough to deal with today's loads.
The new Extended Events are a new lightweight tracing mechanism built directly into the SQLOS thus giving us information SQL Trace just couldn't. They were designed and built with performance in mind and it shows. Mastering Extended Events requires learning at least one new skill: XML querying.
We'll look at how the Extended Events work with only a brief overview of old SQL Trace architecure.
