## Title: Checking in on Tabular Models: Making Them Work Better
## Abstract:
### We've all seen, and probably created, a few tabular models that are just plain slow. For the people just starting with tabular models to those who've been around the block a few times with them, we'll go over some ways in which I've sped up tabular models to be leaner and faster. So join me and learn (or remember) several different things to do with tabular models to make them better for everyone.
