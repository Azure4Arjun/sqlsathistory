## Title: Wrangling performance with Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### In this introductory session we'll delve into the basics of the resource governor feature in SQL Server.  We'll look at the types of issues this feature can help resolve. We'll then delve into various components of the feature, such as a classifier function, workload groups and resource pools.  Finally we'll bring all this together with an example implementation. From there, if time allows, we'll look at best practices and questions to answer to ensure a successful implementation.
