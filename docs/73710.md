## Title: Is it really HA when you upgrade from 2016 to 2017? I say yes.
## Abstract:
### Tasked with upgrading 4 TB worth of data to a new HA cluster, I wanted a faster way to do this. Yes I love binge watching Netflix while files copy and the cluster builds its 4 nodes for 20 hours, but I also value sleep. In this demo heavy session watch while I upgrade an 2016 HA server to 2017 as fast as a planned failover.
