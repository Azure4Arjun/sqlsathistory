## Title: Getting Started with SSIS 2012
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll take a tour through SQL Server Integration Services in SQL Server 2012.  We'll briefly review the essentials of SSIS and will walk through the key elements of data movement and transformation using Integration SErvices.  We'll focus much of our time on the new and improved features in this latest version of SSIS.

This session will be most useful for database professionals with some experience with either DTS or SSIS, including those who are currently using an earlier version of the product and are interested in learning about what's new in 2012.
