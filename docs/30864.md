## Title: SSIShare The Code, Man
## Abstract:
### For many SSIS scenarios, a desired outcome is to implement logic or rules that are already in use in existing enterprise applications.  The only significant difference is that the implementation is done in a bulk data loading scenario.  Many times the logic being applied is complex and multi-step.  Many times enterprises have proprietary rules systems that need consistent application throughout the code base.  We will examine a scenario where complex logic from shared code sources can be applied in SSIS processing.
