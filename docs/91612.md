## Title: SQL Server Security and Vulnerability Assessment in One Hour
## Abstract:
### Security. We are taking it seriously. But as DBA, we are not always up-to-date with all kind of information which we store in our databases. We know that our database and some tables, even some specific columns when we have multiple types of data, users, permissions and so on need to be protected even more than others.

But we need to know. We have GDPR, ISO2700, SOC compliance around us. And nobody tells us what it exactly means. We 'simply' need to be compliant (which is not simple). But we can use the power of SSMS together with Vulnerability Assessment and Security Center to collect all necessary information which we can use later to improve security, as well as decrease risks for our databases. Even better it will cost us (almost) nothing.

We will look for a hybrid environment when our data are on-premises and in the cloud, but we use security tools for both.
