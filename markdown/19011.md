## Title: “Show Me Potential Customers “ : Data Mining Approach
## Abstract:
### In the most marketing departments, the tactical question is about who are going to buy our products.  It is more cost effective to identify and spend money on highly potential customers (than those who are not likely to purchase).  This also affects the advertisement strategy. Potential customers and their traits can be identified by analysing previous purchasing information. Management experts can predict who is going to be their new customers by analysing their current customer purchase information. There are many data mining algorithms which can help with this task.  Microsoft Business Intelligence employs data mining algorithms that are deployed in an easy to use environment.
This demonstration based session will show how to use previous customer purchase information to predict potential customers. We will discuss how to set data sets and use different data mining algorithms to get predictive results and then demonstrate how to find the best predictions.
