## Title: Getting CI right for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This isn't the dark ages any more. You've learned that you need to put your database in source control and you're competent with source control systems like TFS or Git. You've also learned how to express your database in script form using a tool like SSDT, Flyway or Redgate.
 
However, you still haven't written as many automated tests as you know you should and you aren't convinced you're going about it the right way. You haven't really looked at the build functionality in VSTS yet or gotten to grips with build servers like TeamCity or Jenkins, and even if you have you aren't sure how the process should work for SQL Server builds and tests.
 
In this session I'll talk through various ways to automate your database builds as well as how to use tSQLt to create a suite of automated tests, enabling you to spot problems early and giving you confidence in the quality of your code.
