## Title: Getting onboard with Azure Data Warehouse (ADW)
## Abstract:
### Will cover the Azure SQL DW story from its on-premise MPP solution origins (PDW) to its migration to Azure as a "service". Then describe what a multi-dimensional data warehouse and SQL DW are, what patterns are met using ADW, how to get up and running on Azure Data Warehouse (live demo), data transformation/data loading patterns, table design patterns and best practices, and scaling out your Azure Data Warehouse to meet your company's demands.
