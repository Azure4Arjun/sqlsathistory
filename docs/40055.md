## Title: Test-Driven ETL? Join all the Things.
## Abstract:
### Data Warehousing and ETL processes have become standard at most businesses, but testing ETL processes remains difficult and less refined than testing in conventional OO application development. This session will offer practical tools, techniques and discussion of how to make ETL development more test-centric, and improve the quality and agility of data warehouse work. We will look at techniques to automate warehouse testing/data validation and how to move ETL requirements toward something resembling test-driven design, even when the data sources span different applications or technologies.
