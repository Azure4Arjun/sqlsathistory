## Title: Exploring Data Privacy
## Abstract:
### Somewhere out there someone is storing data about you. What defines sensitive and personally identifiable data? What should you, as a consumer, expect in regard to the protection of this data? What should you as a database professional do to ensure that your customer's data is protected? In this session we will explore these and other dimensions of the increasingly critical topic of data privacy.
