## Title: Top errors in DB design and code that hurt our performance
## Abstract:
### I've been working with SQL Server for over then 20 years and during that time I've made and also saw others make some mistakes that caused  performance problems and some times might even caused SQL Server to return an unexpected  data.  In this presentation I'll show few of those mistakes and I will use those mistakes to explain about key features such as creation of query plan, memory grant, etc'.
