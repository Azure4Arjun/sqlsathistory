## Speaker: Kevin Alcock
## Title: Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks
## Abstract:
### Kevin will be talking on the topic of SQL injection - something that all of us need to be aware of and protect against. 

And here is a blurb from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection

" The best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query. For SQL calls, this means using bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, and avoiding dynamic queries. 
Checking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely. Code analysis tools can help a security analyst find the use of interpreters and trace the data flow through the application. Penetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability."

Kevin will give us a demo that will show an injection attack in action and how to mitigate it.
