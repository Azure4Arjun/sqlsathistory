## Title: BIML: Taking the Pain Out of Integration Services Development
## Abstract:
### You have data to move, but you're tired of the pain and suffering that SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) development brings. Business Intelligence Markup Language (BIML) is a popular meta-language that describes SSIS packages and solutions. In this high-speed, demo-laden session, we will look at some of the worst problems in SSIS development and how easily BIML sidesteps them while making you more productive. Most importantly, this session will demonstrate that you can develop SSIS packages without pulling out your hair!
