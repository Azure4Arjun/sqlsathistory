## Title: Your DB in the cloud?
## Abstract:
### Let's face it the cloud is here to stay, and while not every workload will be moving tomorrow an understanding of running database workloads in Azure is a must for every DBA. In this session driven by real world customer conversations we will discuss some of the ramifications of moving your database workload to the cloud. We will look at the PaaS and IaaS offerings available in Azure and discuss the how to choose between them.
