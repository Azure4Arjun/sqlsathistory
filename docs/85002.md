## Title: Data Quality - Plain  Simple
## Abstract:
### Data quality is a subject that comes up over and over again in many organizations. Most executives are concerned about the quality of the information used in their decisions. We talk about "good data" and "bad data" but what do those terms mean? In this presentation, we will first define what data quality is and look at how to measure it with data quality dimensions. Then, we'll explore common causes for data quality issues and how to perform a data quality assessment. Finally, we'll review the results and discuss some strategies and tools that can help improve the quality of the data in your organization.
