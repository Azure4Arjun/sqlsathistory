## Speaker: Kyle Neier
## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks
## Abstract:
### These terms seem to be thrown around all the time – but what do they all mean? In this session we’ll explore the different isolation levels in SQL Server and how they affect the way that blocking and locking behave within the database engine. We’ll dive into the most common locks and how they can be leveraged and avoided to improve your application experience. Once locks are explored, we’ll discuss the dreaded deadlock and discuss techniques to detect and mitigate this troublemaker in your environment.
