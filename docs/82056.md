## Title: Azure Data Factory V2 and SSIS Automation With Biml
## Abstract:
### SSIS was originally designed to work in a world where all data was structured and on premise. As modern enterprise data projects increasingly move online, tools like Azure Data Factory (ADF) can extend SSIS capabilities to the cloud. Azure Data Factory is a flexible and powerful cloud based ETL service, but it doesn't replace the functionality of SSIS. 

In this session you will learn the advantages and disadvantages of both ETL platforms; how to use both in tandem to maximize productivity; and how both ETL platforms, as well as any supporting structures, can be be automatically generated with Biml Script. 

All of the code used in this presentation can be downloaded by attendees, customized, and used in their production environments.
