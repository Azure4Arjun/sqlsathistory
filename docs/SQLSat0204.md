## Title: Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting
## Abstract:
### You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.

# Partitioning for Perf and Management of Large Tabl
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#204-Detroit-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Management of Large Tabl
## Abstract:
### Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

# Making SSIS 2008 Packages More Dynamic
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#204-Detroit-2013)

## Speaker: George Squillace
## Title: Making SSIS 2008 Packages More Dynamic
## Abstract:
### The expression language in SQL Server Integration Services is rich, and there are many locations within a package where the expression language can be used to make packages more dynamic. Within Derived Column transformations, Precedence Constraint evaluation, Script Tasks, Connection Managers, Containers and more, expressions and variables can be used to increase the flexibility of an SSIS package. Remember, “Write once, run many!”

# Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#204-Detroit-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way
## Abstract:
### Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and a new structure that just might make Nested Sets obsolete. For stalwarts, it also includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in 6 seconds) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

# Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#204-Detroit-2013)
Event Date: 16-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Josh Fennessy
## Title: Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation.
