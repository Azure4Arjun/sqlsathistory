## Title: Managing Your Schema with Database Projects in Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### Integrating databases schema changes into a Software Development Lifecycle Management (SDLC) process can be a  daunting and often tedious proposition. Adding the complexity of version control to the mix complicates this scenario. Fortunately, Database Projects in Visual Studio add a bit of an "easy" button to this process. In this session, you will learn about the features and capabilities of VS Database Projects and how to use them to improve the lifecycle of your database structures, even if your organization does no code management.
