## Title: SQL Restore: Optimizing Your Data Recovery
## Abstract:
### When disaster strikes, everyone’s immediate question becomes: How long until the system is back online? Whether it’s a single database or the whole SQL environment, time is essential… As everyone waits for the restore to complete. 

How long will the restoration process take? 
Can it run faster? 

In this session, we’ll answer these questions by looking at the Disaster Recovery process and the options available for performance tuning database restores.
