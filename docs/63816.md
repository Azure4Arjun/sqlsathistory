## Title: MS SQL - Review, Renew, and Reveal
## Abstract:
### We will begin the session by reviewing a few things about MS SQL  T-SQL that you should know (CTE's, window functions, etc). Our next step will be to explore some of the newer features within the SQL verse and how we can use them to write cleaner and more explicit T-SQL (date and string functions + more). We will close out the session exploring some of the newest features released with MS SQL Server 2016.
