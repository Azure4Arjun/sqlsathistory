## Title: 12 Steps to Workload Tuning
## Abstract:
### We might know how to tune a query for optimal performance or create additional indexes to ensure faster execution, but how do we ensure that our changes donâ€™t hurt our total workload? Have you ever completed an upgrade and wondered if you were truly getting better performance?  Do we know if the new 3rd Party application upgrade will make performance better or worse? In this session, we will go over a process used to tune a workload and answer the common questions above. In this presentation we will also use Distributed Replay, XEvents and ClearTrace to answer these questions and even give you a little insight into how you can document these changes to help you get that next raise.
