## Title: Introduction to PostgreSQL
## Abstract:
### PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with decades of continuous active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows, is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages).

This talk will provide an introduction to PostgreSQL by one of the project's committers, including the overall architecture, major features, data types, and capabilities.
