## Title: Fixing Page Life Expectancy
## Abstract:
### Starting with what Page Life Expectancy really means to query, server, and disk performance, we’ll get a firm understanding of what this counter means to you. After that we can start talking about if and how you want to raise it. It’s important to know that this is just a counter and there are situations where you don’t care about it nearly as much as you’d expect. It’s also important to know what effect a drop in PLE mid-day really means beyond query performance, including a possible impact on other, unrelated servers.
