## Title: Error Handling in ETL
## Abstract:
### Too often ETL systems do not incorporate error handling.  When things break at 2 AM – and they ALWAYS break at 2 AM – some poor on call person must get out of bed and deal with something that should have been caught and handled by the code itself.  This session will cover ways for you to help your poor on-call colleagues get a full night’s sleep, thereby gaining you their eternal gratitude.
