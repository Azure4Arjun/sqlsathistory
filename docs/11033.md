## Speaker: Bryan Cafferky
## Title: Breaking Down BI Barriers with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is the language of Windows and as such offers amazing integration and automation opportunities. In this presentation, Bryan will demonstrate how PowerShell can provide self-service BI solutions, serve as a powerful ETL tool and augment database development with far less coding than other languages. This talk starts off where the introduction to PowerShell left off and focuses on the many possibilities PowerShell offers as a development platform. Questions that will be considered include: Is PowerShell a better ETL tool than SSIS? How can you provide a GUI to your PowerShell programs? Which is better C# or PowerShell? You need to attend to see just how important PowerShell is to the Windows world of database development.
