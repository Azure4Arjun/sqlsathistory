## Title: Disaster Recovery  High Availability on the Azure Data Platform
## Abstract:
### While the Azure platform provides built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even within an already protected system. This session will show how the Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings such as Azure SQL Database, Azure MySQL and Azure Managed Instance, are built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your vital information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your databases on the Azure Data Platform.
