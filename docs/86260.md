## Title: Database Backup and Restore Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Backups are a vital part of any DBA's job. Acting as the "last line of defense", we rely on backups to safeguard the company's most important asset: the data. But how do we know we're managing our backups appropriately? This session will cover the fundamental principles of building out our backup (and restore strategy), covering the "why" of backups and best practices for our data protection.
