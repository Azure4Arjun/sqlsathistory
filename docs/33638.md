## Title: Dimensional design 101
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll cover all the pieces of a classic Kimball style data mart (Star schema, fact tables, dimension tables).  We'll talk about the data warehouse bus architecture and how it can be used to quickly create data marts with conformed dimensions.  We'll talk about what it means to have conformed dimensions and why it's important.
