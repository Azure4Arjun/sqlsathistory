## Speaker: Anthony {Tex} Moreign
## Title: The Global Cloud and I
## Abstract:
### This is a special session with multiple presenters showing how to utilize free-ish/no-charge Cloud Offerings (e.g., storage, apps)  – available from around the Globe at this point-in-time Jun 2015.  Even though the free-ish/no-charge offerings are steadily disappearing (e.g., Free Google Apps),  this session will show content that applies to both personal/family and SMB’s (Small/Medium Businesses).    Expect to walk away with goodies (-: as always :-) … and with answers to questions, such as:
–  How do I get started with the Global Cloud today?   
–  Any gotchas to keep in mind?  
–  After this session, where do I go for more ... in Houston?

PRE-REQUISITE:  None other than an interest to utilize the cloud.

NOTE:  The 3 presenters, Tex (20+ year technologist), Valentino  Zane (budding technologists), are with Hybrid Decisions#174; Corp and are presenting on behalf of the “Houston Cloud  Cluster User Group”.
