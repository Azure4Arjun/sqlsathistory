## Title: So you want to be a SQL Saturday speaker?
## Abstract:
### Welcome to SQL Saturday!  If you're attending your first event, I hope you enjoy yourself!  After I attended my first, I realized that I wanted to contribute -- but I didn't know how.  In this presentation, I'll take you through my journey from attending my very first SQL Saturday to becoming a presenter on the SQL Saturday circuit.  You can do it too -- even if you're not a SQL Server MVP!
