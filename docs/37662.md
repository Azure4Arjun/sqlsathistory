## Title: Connecting Power BI to On-Prem SSAS Tabular
## Abstract:
### If you've ever looked at the visualizations available in Power BI for Office 365 or the robust sharing capabilities available with the cloud service, but the requirement of uploading/storing data in the cloud was a deal-breaker, there is a new option available for you in the current Power BI Preview. The new Power BI Analysis Services Connector allows you to directly query on-premises SSAS Tabular data for display in Power BI. In this session, we'll go through installation and configuration of this Connector which can open all-new data sources for use in the cloud.
