## Title: Create Your Own Data Type
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed a data type that SQL Server simply does not support? So why not add it?
Ever since SQL Server 2005, you can easily create additional data types for use in SQL Server. Using .NET integration, you can define a data type and program all the methods you need to make it behave exactly the way you want it to - both in the database and in your .NET application programs.
This session will show you exactly how to create a CLR user-defined data type, and how to integrate it in your database. Will you be the one who creates the next Big Thing, the data type that puts Spatial and Hierarchyid to shame?
