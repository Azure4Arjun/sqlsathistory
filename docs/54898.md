## Title: Query Optimizer Changes in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 brings us a lot of new and even revolutionary features, which is very exciting. However, the core components keep evolving too. One of these components is Query Optimizer, the most complicated, crucial and less understandable part of SQL Server.

The session will make a deep dive into the Query Optimizer internals and show some changes and new features of the SQL Server 2016. This will help you to understand how works the optimization process and certain features, and what changes you may came across in the query plans if you upgrade to SQL Server 2016.
