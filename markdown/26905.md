## Title: Database Monitoring : Trying To Keep Sane
## Abstract:
### Each of our database systems has its complexities, its idiosyncrasies, its touchy points. Digging into each of these, understanding them, baselining them and monitoring them is an essential part of a DBA's job. Doing these simple tasks in such a way that allows you to sleep at night while your systems churn away safely and gracefully is an art that we all attempt to accomplish.
We will discuss various ideas, tools, approaches, and solutions to how to monitor different pieces of our systems. Examples, code, tools, will all be shown off and shared so we can all do better.
