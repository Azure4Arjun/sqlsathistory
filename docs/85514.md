## Title: Laying Down the Law with SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### Mixed workload patterns can present resource utilization and performance challenges even on the beefiest database servers. Neither prior testing nor careful code promotion alone can prevent runaway queries from disrupting normal business activities.  In this session we'll stress SQL Server 2017 to explore Resource Governor strategies for managing concurrency and access to resources. Weâ€™ll look at the improved observability and troubleshooting ability that Resource Governor brings to a busy database server.  We'll also discuss throttles outside of Resource Governor that can assist in these areas.
