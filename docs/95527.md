## Title: Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### With the smorgasbord of Azure service available, how do you approach building a modern enterprise data warehouse?

In this pre-con we will be covering both architecture patterns from Microsoft and actual implementations in the industry on how to move to Azure for your data warehousing needs. We'll cover the various offerings of Azure including storage, data ingestion and orchestration, databases , NoSQL, and streaming.

We'll also cover how to analyze all of this data with tools and services like Power BI and Databricks. Finally, we'll cover strategies on how you get there; Lift-and-shift, hybrid, or brand new implementations will all be discussed.

By the end of this pre-con you should have a thorough understanding of architecting a modern enterprise data warehouse in Azure including getting those services to work together and how to use that data effectively!
