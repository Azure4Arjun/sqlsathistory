## Title: The Compression Session
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 allows you to compress your data in several different ways. Your tables can be compressed using row compression or page compression, and your can also choose to compress your backups. In this session we'll look at what kinds of data give you the most space savings when compressed, and we'll also discuss the algorithms SQL Server uses to compress your data. Knowing how SQL Server performs compression will allow us to evalutate when the space savings will be worth the cost, and when you might want to avoid compression.
