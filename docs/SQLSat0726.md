## Title: Data Modeling for the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### A theoretical discussion on two methods that professional data modelers use to model data (ERD and star schema). 

We discuss why we need to model data, benefits / value of modeling data, and why we select one modeling technique over the other. Once we understand why and when we use these different modeling techniques, we will focus in on dimensional modeling that is used when developing data warehouses, SSAS cubes and Power BI. 

Sample diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion.

## Speaker: Marc Beacom
## Title: ETL Best Practices and Techniques
## Abstract:
### ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is the backbone of any data project and can be upwards of 70% or more of the effort. The tools you have access to allow you to make progress in a hurry. However, are you implementing best practices and techniques that will scale to the demands you need? Or will you be refactoring far too quickly than you should to meet performance requirements?

Gain helpful insights from decades of lessons learned and walk away with best practices you can implement in your own ETL solution.

# PowerBI, from a DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-726)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: PowerBI, from a DBA
## Abstract:
### Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

# Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-726)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
## Abstract:
### Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

# Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-726)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
## Abstract:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

# SQL Server on Linux, a new frontier
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-726)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Robert Miller
## Title: SQL Server on Linux, a new frontier
## Abstract:
### At one time, Microsoft SQL Server was only available on the Windows platform.  This expanded to the Azure cloud environment, though still on the Windows platform.  One stronghold of the other RDB vendors remained and it has a significant installed base, Linux.  Well, not just Linux, but "Open Source" systems and those derived from the open source operating systems, OS X included.  
With the release of Microsoft SQL Server for Linux, this last major hurdle in the enterprise is starting to fall.  There is much more product development work needed to catch its older brother, but Microsoft SQL Server for Linux has become interesting and viable for the enterprise and hobbyist.  Join me as we take a look at what is currently available in Microsoft SQL Server for Linux.

# Solving Common DBA Problems With R
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-726)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Steve Williams
## Title: Solving Common DBA Problems With R
## Abstract:
### External script languages were introduced to SQL Server in 2016, starting with R and continuing with Python in SQL 2017.  To familiarize myself, I attended various community sessions, but each one was about statistics, anomaly detection, or forecasting.  That's all interesting, but it’s not my thing, so we won't be talking about any of that!  This is a demo rich session about things you didn't know you could do from SQL Server with the help of R, such as parse JSON or convert to CSV, integrate Azure Key Vault for securely storing passwords, get documents from Azure Cosmos DB and add them to your data warehouse, archive tables across platforms, quick and simple ETL, and finding out easily which column of data is causing that "String or Binary data will be truncated" error.  Come join me for some eye opening demos about the many practical uses of R for non-statisticians!
