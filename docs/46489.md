## Title: A closer look at Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory is a modern data orchestration platform design to help you manage any data of any size from any source. It also makes a number of technologies available to you such as Azure Machine learning so that you can integrate predictive machine learning models in your data pipelines. This platform enables you to create intelligent applications that not only provide insights but can also recommend actions upon specific events. Join me in this session as we take a closer look at many of the capabilities built into the platform.
