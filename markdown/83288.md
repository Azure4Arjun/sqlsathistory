## Title: Most common mistakes data scientists make
## Abstract:
### In the middle of deploying the model, team of data scientists realize that the predictions are "somewhat-off". Troubleshooting on the horizon and what to do.

Session will guide you through most common mistakes data scientists and statisticians are making when preparing and engineering the data using
T-SQL or any other database system. Further more,  we will explore common statistical and data science mistakes when modeling data, extracting know-how from the data, finding the hidden patterns and running different test against the structural models using mainly R, Python, or Spark.

What not-to-do will be replaced with what to-do explanations using sample datasets and sample codes.

Some statistical knowledge or background is a plus!
