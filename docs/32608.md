## Title: Database Mirroring: Maximizing Availability Throug
## Abstract:
### Database Mirroring is often thought of as a “set and forget it” technology. But what happens if there are problems and the one person on your team that knows mirroring inside and out is not there? You can have a prolonged outage or you can be prepared ahead of time and set up automation procedures for all of your database mirroring needs.

This session will cover setting up processes to detect problems with database mirroring and setting up processes to automate the maintenance and disaster recovery tasks for database mirroring. Included in the session will be detecting a single database failure and automatically failing over all mirrored databases in response.
