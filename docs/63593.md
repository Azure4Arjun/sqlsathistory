## Title: Creating Your First Azure Machine Learning Model
## Abstract:
### Azure Machine Learning is a predictive analytics service that allows you to quickly create and deploy analytic solutions. These solutions can predict future trends based on current and historical data. This allows solutions to get smarter over time. Azure Machine Learning Studio allows you to set up an experiment using drag-and-drop modules preprogrammed with predictive modeling techniques with just a web browser. 

This session will provide a fundamental introduction to the Azure Machine Learning cloud service (as well as key machine learning paradigms and concepts). In addition, we will go over setting up a workspace, training a machine learning model, and publishing the model as web service using Machine Learning Studio.
