## Speaker: Cory Roth
## Title: Getting the most out of SharePoint Search
## Abstract:
### The number one complaint about Enterprise Search is usually summed up by a statement like this: “I can’t find anything!”. Whether you are using SharePoint Foundation with Search Server Express, SharePoint Server 2010, or FAST Search for SharePoint, the quality of the results you receive from search is only as good as the input you give it. Out-of-the-box, SharePoint gives you a very functional search engine, but you need to do some work to really enable the full power it provides. This intro level talk will teach you the basics of Enterprise Search in SharePoint. Here you will learn about the basic building blocks such as content sources, crawled properties, managed properties, and scopes.

# Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#64---Baton-Rouge-2011)
Event Date: 06-08-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS/SSRS
## Speaker: Ira Warren
## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.

# Unraveling Tangled Code–Tale of Victory Over Chaos
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#64---Baton-Rouge-2011)
Event Date: 06-08-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL Admin I
## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code–Tale of Victory Over Chaos
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled 
with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible 
to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One 
might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If 
you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you 
break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for 
conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding 
mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, 
turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible.

## Title: Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks or packages that adhere to a pattern, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS
## Abstract:
### So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy. But now you have new requirements that require more advanced data warehouse approaches, like late arriving dimensions, bridge tables, parent child dimensions, and Type 3 or Type 6 slowly changing dimensions (SCD). How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.

# Data in the Stream: Introducing StreamInsight
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#64---Baton-Rouge-2011)
Event Date: 06-08-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Bonus Track
## Speaker: J Sawyer
## Title: Data in the Stream: Introducing StreamInsight
## Abstract:
### Introduced as a part of the Sql Server 2008 R2 platform, StreamInsight is Microsoft's Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine. It allows you to analyze and process large volumes of data - think tens to hundreds of thousands of events per second - with sub-second response time. It's as close to real time as you can get without quantum entanglement! The Sql Server engine may be fast ... but it's just not that fast. 
This presentation will introduce core CEP concepts and sample uses cases and then dive into kinkiness with real-time data, including hosting StreamInsight, getting data into (and out of) the engine, how time is handled, writing queries in Linq and how to extend the StreamInsight engine.
It's a whole new paradigm of looking at data

## Title: Back to Basics - Threading in .NET
## Abstract:
### Multi-core processors are becoming pretty prevalent for most business user's workstations these days. This trend has increased the benefits for developer's to take advantage of multiple threads in applications. While not every application will benefit from being multi-threaded this programming tool should be in every .NET developers tool belt. Unfortunately in my experience the majority of .NET developers are not comfortable with this programming paradigm and are afraid to ask. This session dives into the basics behind threads, outlines all the different threading options in .NET, and then walks through programming examples using .NET 2.0 and 4.0.
