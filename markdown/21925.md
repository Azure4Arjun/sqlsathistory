## Title: In-Memory OLTP Internals for SQL Server 2014 CTP2
## Abstract:
### New in SQL Server 2014, In-Memory OLTP is a memory-optimized OLTP database engine for SQL Server. Depending on the reason for poor performance with your disk-based tables, In-Memory OLTP can help you achieve significant performance and scalability gains by using algorithms that are optimized for accessing memory-resident data, optimistic concurrency control that eliminates logical locks, lock free objects are used to access all data and threads that perform transactional work donâ€™t use locks or latches for concurrency control.

In-memory OLTP is essentially the latest evolution in database engine technology and provides full durability for memory-optimized tables.
