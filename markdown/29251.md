## Title: Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale
## Abstract:
### It happens to everyone.  One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow, steady rate.  Then next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load.  Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives.  In this session, we will examine best practices to apply to databases that grow to become very large databases (VLDB).  From hardware configurations (IO, CPU, RAM) to database and index design and partitioning strategies, we will examine which solutions and strategies help and which ones hinder our database on its road to recovery.
