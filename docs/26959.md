## Title: Build An Affordable SQL Server 2012 Lab
## Abstract:
### Do you have an affordable lab set-up running SQL Server 2012 on Windows 2012 to learn and play with? In the 70-462 Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases Training Kit, you will need six (!) machines on their own domain to complete the exercises. Using VMWare Workstation 9 ($250), Todd will show how to set up your lab environment on a ~$500 laptop running Windows 7 64-bit, 8GB of RAM, and an SSD drive using less than 40GB of space for the six virtual machines! Using free iso(s), we will run through several of the set-up exercises from the 70-462 Training Kit in order to build out the training lab. Participants will leave with enough knowledge and links to resources to build their own affordable SQL Server 2012 lab.
