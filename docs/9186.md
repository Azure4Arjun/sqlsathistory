## Title: Tabular vs. Multidimensional in SQL Server Analysis Services 
## Abstract:
### Since 2012, SQL Server Analysis Services has two engines: Tabular and Multidimensional. Somebody believes Multidimensional is granny stuff and aim to learn only Tabular. Somebody trust only the good-old well-debugged code of Multidimensional, and ignores Tabular. We try to use a more informed approach: by looking at the difference in features, hardware requirements, scalability, required knowledge and business needs, we will discuss which engine to use for which kind of project. The goal is to teach when to use what, and to avoid the common mistakes of choosing the wrong technology, which might be a very expensive error.
