## Title: Measure Performance Through Baselines
## Abstract:
### You get a ticket or email indicating there is a problem with the database and are asked to review.  How do you know there is a problem?  Baselines.  Without a set known measurements to compare against it will be impossible to know whether your change is helping.  This session reviews the process for collecting information about your SQL Server so you can compare current processes with historical processes.  Once you understand the current behavior of the database, you can measure the impact of any change.  This session will review ways to set up the collection of performance information and make it available for review later.
