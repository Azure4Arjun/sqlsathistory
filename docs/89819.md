## Title: Storytelling  interactive reports with Power BI Bookmarks  Drillthrough
## Abstract:
### How to make sure that the end-user of your Power BI report understands the information well? There is way more involved in presenting your data then only a chart. Think about interaction, presenting the right information at the right time and much more! 

By using Story telling it is possible to tell the story behind the data. Where does the information need come from and how did we get to an answer? The complete storyline covered in your reports and dashboards to make sure the data is interpreted in the right way by the users. 

During this session I well tell more about the principles of story telling. Beside of that this session will be covered with lots of Power BI demos. During these demos I will give examples of functionality within Power BI which can be used to create your own story in Power BI. I will not only show the end result, but also how to create a report or dashboard like that to tell your own story!
