## Title: Cross Platform Mobile Development with Xamarin
## Abstract:
### Xamarin enables C# devs to become native iOS, Android, and Windows mobile app dev overnight. Learn how to leverage your existing .NET and C# skills to create iOS and Android mobile apps in Visual Studio. In addition to allowing you to write your iOS and Android apps in C#, Xamarin lets you reuse existing .NET libraries and share your business logic across iOS, Android, and Windows apps. 

During this session we cover the Xamarin platform and how to create native iOS, Android, and Windows apps in C#. See what's new and next for Xamarin development inside of Visual Studio.
