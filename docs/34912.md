## Title: So you are a BI Developer by Accident
## Abstract:
### You might be a DBA who deals with databases or a developer who creates applications, and you hear that you will be appointed to provide a business intelligence solution which will empower decision makers by displaying key measures of your department, company or client. This session is to help you where to start, giving an overview about the complete on-premise BI toolset of Microsoft, along with the analysis of your infrastructure constraints which influence how your BI solution will look like at the end of the day.
The session also helps those who are planning to introduce the BI-related services (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, MDS, DQS) of SQL Server to their companies, squeezing the last euro out of their SQL Server and Office license investments.
