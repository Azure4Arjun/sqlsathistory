## Title: Cube Processing Strategies
## Abstract:
### There has been a wide range of Cube solutions implemented over the years.  Cube processing strategies will cover both Multidimensional and Tabular cubes.  Best practices will be included for processing large and small cubes.  Processing big cubes can consume a large amount of IO, and create lengthy response times.  Processing many small cubes at once can create bottlenecks on the database.   Additionally, processing complex cube will be addressed.  Best practices for designing dimensions and partitions will be covered in detail, because of the impact associated with good design.
