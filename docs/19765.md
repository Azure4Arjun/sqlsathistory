## Title: Extended Events - A whirlwind tour!
## Abstract:
### We've all used SQL profiler, and most of us are familiar with server side traces.
SQL SERVER 2008 brought us Extended Events (XEvents), a more lightweight and flexible form of tracing.
However SQL SERVER 2008 has no native UI support for XEvents, which could be one reason for their apparent slow up take.
Learning the syntax now - and seeing what goes on behind the scenes of an XEvent session - will give you a firm understanding of their power and flexibility and place you in the position of knowing what is going on in the background when SQL SERVER 2012 brings us a fully functional UI for XEvents management.
