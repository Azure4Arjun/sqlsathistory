## Title: Creating a Performance Baseline for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Creating a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance provides many benefits including defining a starting point for optimization efforts, documenting the server, a reference point for capacity planning, and providing a reference for ongoing performance comparison.  This session will provide a detailed presentation of an approach for collecting, storing, and presenting performance metrics for use in developing a baseline performance assessment of a SQL Server instance.
