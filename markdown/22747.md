## Speaker: Ryan Duclos
## Title: *** Reporting Services Support /Tips/Tricks ***
## Abstract:
### I challenge you to bring your SSRS report issues to this session. Together we will try to find a way to solve your reporting issues. To help with solving your reporting issues, it would be great if you could bring the t-sql scripts to create the required schema and data. It would also be great to bring the report files that need to be updated. 

If you don't have any reporting issues, I'll have a few reports to show you. These reports are a lot more complex then most of the reports you need to create. Though they will demonstrate some tips and tricks.
