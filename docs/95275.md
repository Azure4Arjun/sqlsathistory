## Title: Introduction to MongoDB
## Abstract:
### Getting started with MongoDB is not always easy. This gentle introduction goes heavy on the demo to show you what it feels like to use MongoDB as a developer. Rather than relying on extra frameworks and such, we'll access MongoDB directly from the shell and Node, and see how you achieve both simple and complex data manipulation tasks.
 
Along the way, we'll  cuts through some myths and misunderstandings surrounding MongoDB. You will learn what's unique about this database, how best to leverage its capabilities, and be well positioned to decide if this is a good fit for application.
