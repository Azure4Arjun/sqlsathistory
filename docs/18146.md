## Title: Letâ€™s get parallel
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered how Microsoft and Unisys loaded 1TB of data in 30 minutes?  They used as many parallel processes as possible.  This session will walk through a solution that makes heavy use of parallel processing.  We will look at the use of scope to isolate threads and script tasks to determine and spread the workload across multiple threads. Additionally, we will look at how to determine how many parallel processes should be run on a single server and techniques to spread loads over multiple servers.
