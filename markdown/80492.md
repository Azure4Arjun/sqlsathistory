## Speaker: SQLSaturday Orange County
## Title: SQL Solutions Group: The DBA Is Dead.  Long Live the Remote DBA.
## Abstract:
### Over the past decade, the rate of change in the industry has accelerated exponentially and the always fluid role of a DBA  has morphed to the point where many organizations don’t even have the role anymore or it is combined with other duties.  What does this mean for the DBA?  For developers?  For organizations?   While we certainly don’t have all the answers, we’ve been doing this for a very long time and have seen lots of trends and buzzwords come and go.  This session will be a fun and open discussion on these trends and how outsourcing the mundane so your key people can focus on the highest value activities may be the best way to go for many organizations.
