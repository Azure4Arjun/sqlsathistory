## Title: Inside the DBAtools PowerShell Module
## Abstract:
### There has been a movement towards PowerShell in the SQL Server Community lately. With so much out there, how do you get ahead.  I will take you through this massive module that has grown very quickly to over 300 functions for use in your daily DBA job. This module can single handedly migrate an entire server with one command, or you can choose the parts you want to do and just do those. Join me to find out how you can quickly leverage the power of this module. This is one tool you want in your PowerShell toolbox.
