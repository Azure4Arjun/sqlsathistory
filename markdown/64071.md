## Title: Optimizing SQL Server Performance in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll look over some of the things which you should be looking at within your virtual environment to ensure that you are getting the performance out of it that you should be.  This will include how to look for CPU performance issues at the host level.  We will also be discussing the Memory Balloon drivers and what they actually do, and how you should be configuring them, and why.  We'll discuss some of the memory sharing technologies which are built into vSphere and Hyper-V and how they relate to SQL Server.  Then we will finish up with some storage configuration options to look at.
