## Speaker: Mark Stacey
## Title: PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### 
PowerPivot, while being an Excel add-in, was built by the SQL team, and is one of the most powerful data integration tools in the Microsoft stack. In this session, you will learn how to combine data from web services, tables and cubes to build a powerful model, and visualise it in Excel. An introduction to Time Intelligence using DAX will lead us on to the new features in version 2, and we will move from the Date table to relationships, perspectives and KPIs.
As an added bonus, you will see how to pull the model into Visual Studio, decorate it with new attributes, and show the visualisations in other tools such as PowerView
