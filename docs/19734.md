## Title: The DBA with his head in the clouds
## Abstract:
### With Azure data centres located in Australia, will your company be looking more at cloud options?  The Azure VM approach doesn't change your day to day role much, but Azure SQL Database certainly does.

This session will look at the DBA functions for an Azure SQL Database instance and compare that with your regular on-premise approach.  We'll demo some of techniques that can be used.
