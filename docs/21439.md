## Title: SQLCLR Real World Usage
## Abstract:
### SQLCLR was introduced in SQL Server 2005 with much fanfare. Unfortunately the uptake of it was not as good as Microsoft would have wanted. This does not mean however that SQLCLR is not useful, it is very useful in the right circumstances. In this session we will see how to use SQLCLR and how it is being used in production to solve real-world hard problems. The session is high on code and low in slides!
