1- There is a nonsargable filter
2- An index is missing
3- It is a query optimizer mistake
4- The subquery is unnecessary
5- Query join order is incorrect
6- A filtered statistic is missing
7- Scalar functions are running twice per each row
8- High number of reads on worktable
9- An unknown syntax could be used
10- Memory grant wasn’t enough
11- Distributed query doesn't look good
12- Residual predicates
13- Avoid window spool ondisk
