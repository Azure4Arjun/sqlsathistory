## Title: Introduction to Serverless Architecture
## Abstract:
### Serverless Architecture is a huge paradigm shift and allows you to build and run applications without the need for provisioning or managing servers. Organizations are rapidly moving towards public cloud providers and adapting serverless to reduce their operational costs and have the ability to scale their workload with high availability.

If you are a software developer, IT Pro or an Architect, come join me in this session to learn more about the serverless concepts, understand the use cases of serverless architectures, look at few of the real world implementations which I have worked on and evaluate its effectiveness within your organization.
