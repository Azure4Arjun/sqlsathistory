## Title: Creating solid Power Pivot data models
## Abstract:
### Self-service business intelligence is rapidly gaining popularity among business analysts today. It greatly relieves the problems created by traditional data warehouse implementations, which typically require a long formal development cycle. Using tools such as Microsoft's Power Pivot, Power Query and Power View alters the process significantly. These tools transform the BI analysis cycle into an agile process that will empower and excite your business analysts.

At the core of every successful data analysis project is a robust data model. In this session, Dan will take you through the process of creating a solid data model in Power Pivot. You will learn how to import data from various sources, combine these in a scalable data model. In addition, you will discover how you can set various properties in the Power Pivot model to enhance the user experience when they create interactive visualisations of the data in Power View.
