## Title: Stop Bad Data in its OLTP Tracks
## Abstract:
### Incorrect, inaccurate and misleading data can get into a database in a variety of ways. It causes bugs, impacts customers and hurts business. This session will explain how DBAs and developers can proactively ensure the data coming into a transactional system is clean and correct. The topics covered will include table design, the pitfalls of NULL, “garbage in”, transactions, change management, and coding standards. 

The presentation will draw on the speaker's years of personal experience managing busy e-commerce databases supporting multi-million dollar businesses. The speaker will use real-life examples and demos to illustrate the many ways that OLTP data quality can be compromised.
