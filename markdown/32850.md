## Title: It’s not called Wussyshell
## Abstract:
### Powershell is the enterprise DBAs best friend.  It’s the only way to get your environment completely under control with very little effort.  You can easily build templates that extend what you’ve already got and you can use them to bring hundreds, or even thousands of servers into compliance with next to no effort.  Learn how to manage a very large environment with powershell from a DBA who does it every day.  Here you’ll learn how to build a system of templates that you can use to manage all levels of configuration and alerting.  You’ll learn how to gather and alert on almost every aspect of your server as well as manage and standardize them.
