## Title: Azure Data Studio Extension Development
## Abstract:
### Cross-platform and approachably extensible, Azure Data Studio is a new application for database development and management. Azure Data Studio extensions can create efficiencies by automating a workflow or integrating with an external system. 

This session will take the audience through the fundamentals of extension development for Azure Data Studio with Typescript and other open source tools. Our discussion will include available internal APIs, hosting your extension on GitHub, and sharing your work through the extension marketplace. By demonstrating each concept through building an extension in the session, we will end with a working extension utilizing functionality released recently in Azure Data Studio.
