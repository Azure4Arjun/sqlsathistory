## Title: HA/DR - Too Many Choices!
## Abstract:
### Your company needs to achieve high availability and disaster recovery, but there are many choices nowadays (More than a few ways inside of SQL Server, third-party options, on-prem, cloud, VM based technologies, oh my!). How do you choose what's right for YOU and your company?

In this session, you'll wade through all of the choices and understand the pros and cons of each. You'll also learn which questions you should be asking of the business. Find your needs. Then the right solution. Not the other way around!

You'll leave more informed about the choices, have some guides to help you pick, and you'll be on your way to the right choice! This session is for SQL Server technologists who "get SQL," but are looking to weigh their HA/DR options out and want to level up their knowledge and go back to the office prepared to be a consultant to your company and tackle those HA/DR needs.
