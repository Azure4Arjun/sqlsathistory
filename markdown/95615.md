## Title: The Power of Electric Snakes! An Introduction to PySpark for Big Data Analytics
## Abstract:
### Big Data Analytics is becoming a major priority for more organizations every day.  However, traditional Hadoop skills are still difficult to find, expensive to hire and time-consuming to train.  In this introductory session, we'll see how it is easy to get started with Big Data Analytics using Spark and Python.  We'll learn how to perform standard analytical tasks, like creating RDDs and Data Frames, transforming columns and creating aggregations.  Be sure to bring your rubber suits, because we'll be playing with lightning...snakes.
