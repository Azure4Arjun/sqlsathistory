## Title: Backups  Restores: You're Not In Kansas Anymore!
## Abstract:
### There is no place like home, there is no place like home! When a database crashes and you have to recover it, this may be what you're saying to yourself over and over.  It can feel like a house just landed on you if you're not prepared.  Ok, not really, but recovering a database from an unexpected event is often just as terrifying! If you aren't prepared for it, it's really going to hurt.  So what do you do? You prepare. You plan. You practice.  We'll talk about how the backup  restore process works in SQL Server and how it can help you prevent a Wizard of Oz situation!
