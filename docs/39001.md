## Title: Introducing Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Who needs to move data around? Everyone, of course. Whether we're moving data on-premises or in the cloud, Microsoft's Azure Data Factory (ADF) service is a great way to compose and manage the pipelines that transform data inside and between our systems. ADF integrates well with existing Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) frameworks while closing the gaps left by data-UNaware task schedulers. In this introductory, highly-interactive session, you'll learn how ADF can help you visualize, define and manage data as it moves around, no matter whether that's on-premises, in the cloud or in between the two. Even though this is an introductory session, basic familiarity with common ETL and task-scheduling concepts is recommended.
