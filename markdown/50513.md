## Title: Digging Into ASP.NET Core 1
## Abstract:
### With the release of ASP.NET Core 1, a slew of major changes have been made to the way ASP.NET applications are built. In this presentation, we will talk about the new structure of ASP.NET projects, covering aspects like project structure, the updated project file, the new request pipeline, dependency injection, and middleware. We will also cover the new features of ASP.NET Core 1 MVC like tag helpers, view components, and bundling changes. This presentation assumes the attendee has some experience with the ASP.NET MVC framework.
