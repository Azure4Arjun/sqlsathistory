### SharePoint – let’s admit it – is here to stay; It has become the business collaboration platform of choice for the enterprise and the binding element in the Office family of tools. However deploying and configuring can be a challenging task for the IT pro.
In this session we will walk through the configuration of a complete on-premises BI platform with SharePoint. We will configure different scenarios, and the technologies necessary for building the infrastructure. After this session you will be able to setup the applications and all the supporting services to make SharePoint a successful and performant BI platform. From Excel services to Kerberos delegation.
