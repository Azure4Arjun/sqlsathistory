What better way to optimize the performance of the database than talk about their indexes. What do you need to know in order to make these suggestions, and implement them. This session will cover the basics on indexes, and then demonstrate ways to improve DB performance. Missing Indexes, Duplicate Indexes, Fragmented Indexes, Covering Indexes, Clustered  Nonclustered indexes, and the queries that love them. I will also demo how to correlate the worst performing queries with missing indexes
