## Title: Accelerating Batch Processing with Apache Spark
## Abstract:
### The Apache Spark framework can accelerate processing 100x or more on Hadoop from diverse data sources such as Cassandra, Hive, or HBase.  Using Azure’s HDInsight and Spark we’re going to look at the architecture and go step by step through examples with R and Python against public data sources.
