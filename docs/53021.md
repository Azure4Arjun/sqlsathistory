## Title: Query Optimizer (engl)
## Abstract:
### Despite of the fact the Query Optimizer represents one of the core features of SQL Server there is only little know about the internals. In this session we will deal with the different tasks, methods and phases of this important feature. The knowledge will leverage the tuning of query plans but will also emphasize the limits of the query engine. 
The session (level 300 â€“ 400) assumes that you are familiar with the fundamentals of the query plan.
