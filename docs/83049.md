## Title: DataGrip IDE: How your tool can help writing SQL
## Abstract:
### Now IDEs on IntelliJ-platform are one of the most popular tools for developers. More than two million people use IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm and other IDEs. At the same time, they use various SQL clients for writing and executing statements. But working with SQL is possible just from these IDEs. There is also a stand-alone IDE for SQL called DataGrip which was created based on a huge expertise in code-insight which JetBrains, IntelliJ creators, have. In this session, I will briefly show main tips and tricks of using database support inside IDE's based on IntelliJ platform. 

— Tips for writing and executing statements
— Editing data from UI
— Using code completion and code inspections
— Comparing result-sets
— Searching through database objects
— Navigating through data
— and other features.
