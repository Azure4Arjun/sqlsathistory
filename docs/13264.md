## Title: Rapid Table Restore
## Abstract:
### Restoring a full database just to get one table creates a burden on DBA time, IT infrastructure and SQL resources.  Come learn about a solution that can make this process more efficient. Imagine being able to browse backups and storage tier snapshots to find and copy out the table you need without having to use SQL to restore the entire database!
