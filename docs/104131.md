## Title: Power BI for the Faint of Heart - A look at tools and services that make up the Power BI landscape
## Abstract:
### Power BI has grown and morphed over the past half decade with its modest start as a Desktop app, Mobile App and PaaS offering.  We will talk about the bits and pieces you might be interested in to support your Power BI solutions.  Sure, we will cover the Desktop App, Mobile App and PaaS, but we will also talk about the Premium service offerings, the On-premises Data Gateway and Power BI Report Server.  Hopefully this tour of the landscape will help you in taking your first steps to discovering how Power BI can help uncover insights in your data.
