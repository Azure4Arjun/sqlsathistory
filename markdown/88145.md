## Title: integration between Sql Server and big data
## Abstract:
### Sql server is here to stay. the database in the cloud architecture or on premise is the heart of the business. SQL alone is not enough to allow us big insights from our data , insights we need in order to stay in competition. for these purposes we need data lake , we need search engines , columnar databases , predictive analytics tools etc. in this session we will discuss how we can move data in real time from our main SQL Server to the data lake , we will discuss several big data leading products such as Snowflake , Vertica , Elastic search etc and how we can integrate quickly from SQL server to these products.
