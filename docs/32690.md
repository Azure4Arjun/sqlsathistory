## Title: Stored procedure tracing using the xml datatype 
## Abstract:
### When running a stored procedure it is difficult to record what is happening. I developed a simple logging mechanism.  In this session we will examine logger code in T-SQL I added to a stored procedure. We will use the xml datatype to record parameter values, variable values and debug statements. We will look at the "For xml" statement as well as the xml datatype methods, especially the modify method.  Finally we will look at how to read the logs when finished.
