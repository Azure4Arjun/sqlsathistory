## Title: Slow Query: Bring It On
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting slow performance issues is hindered by lack of available repro or even at times lack of available statistics. This puts the chief troubleshooter in a Catch-22 situation. Without identifying the problem, the issue could resurface again and create another critical business problem. SQL Server 2016 introduces two new features to troubleshoot query performance issues in a reactive and proactive manner namely, Live Query Statistics and Query Data Store. 

In this session, you will learn about:
1. Using Live Query Statistics to perform live troubleshooting while it is running
2. Using Query Data Store and becoming a SQL superhero by answering questions about query performance with a click of a few buttons
