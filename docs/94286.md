## Title: Missing T-SQL querying features for handling NULLs and for data analysis
## Abstract:
### The ISO/IEC SQL standard has many strong querying features that were not implemented in SQL Server. This session covers some of those features and demonstrates the workarounds that we use that do work in T-SQL. The session primarily focuses on two areas of missing featuresâ€”NULL-related features and features related to data analysis like window functions and row pattern recognition.
