## Title: Automating the deployment of Linux VMs with SQL Server through Ansible
## Abstract:
### With the recent technological evolution caused by the growth of the cloud, as well as by the open-source revolution at Microsoft, new challenges and tasks have emerged. Functions such as Data Engineer and Cloud Engineer become more and more common and requested.
In an environment with high-scale needs and agility in the processes, it became imperative to use some kind of automation, in order to meet the demand in an intelligent and standardized way.
In this session, I will show you how Ansible can help us create VMs on Azure, adjust their settings and install a SQL Server instance. All of this in a scalable and consistent way. With the automation, you will be moved from lead actor to a mere spectator, but you will still be the protagonist :)
