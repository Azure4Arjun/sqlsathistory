## Title: Database Virtualization and Drinking out of the Fire Hose 
## Abstract:
### A database by its very nature is one of the most resource intensive applications you will ever virtualize. This is even more difficult to do correctly in the context of a virtualized infrastructure that is a shared resource environment. We will look at every possible dynamic to virtualizing a database from Design, Storage, Memory and Network considerations. This presentation is based upon material given at VMworld from a presentation that was in the top 10 out of all presentation given.
