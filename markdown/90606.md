## Title: Applying Agile in Business Intelligence
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, we will be discussing the merits of Agile processes in Business Intelligence (BI) development. 
First of all the focus will be on explaining the differences between Agile methodology and Waterfall processes in BI and why Agile is here to stay. 
Agile requires a specific mindset in BI projects due to being full stack and we give pointers on what rules can make your communication with the business more fluent. 
This will include the value of maintaining live documentation for both business and developer.
We then look at technical limitations for implementing Agile that are specific to BI and how to overcome these. 
Following this, we can describe how we're pragmatically going to apply these principles, and elaborate on splitting up the scopes in a project (staging, Data Warehouse, and reporting layers). 
By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of Agile development in BI, and some tools of how to apply this to your day to day operations.
