## Title: SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know
## Abstract:
### As a production DBA, do you struggle to schedule heavy jobs to avoid times when the server is already overloaded? Have you ever felt like your end users notice data corruption, blocked processes, or a full tempdb even before you do? And have you ever been frustrated by the fact that Agent never stores quite enough job history to help you troubleshoot job failures? The fact is, SQL Server Agent can do way more than just schedule jobs at a fixed time.  In this session you'll learn how to make SQL Agent run jobs only when ample CPU resources are available, how you can be the first to get notified when data corruption has occurred, and how to use Agent for monitoring data file size issues. You will also walk away with a set of scripts that will help you customize job history retention.  By the end of this demo rich session you will understand how to leverage SQL Agentâ€™s hidden gems that will make your database management job more efficient without requiring additional development time.
