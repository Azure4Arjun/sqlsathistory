## Title: Understanding and Monitoring Tempdb
## Abstract:
### Every SQL Server system that you work with has a tempdb database. In this session, learn how tempdb is structured, what it is used for, and what common performance problems are tied to this shared resource. Gain an understanding of tempdb contention and the snapshot isolation version store and how to detect problems with both. You will leave this session with a new confidence in what configuration and file settings may prevent problems in your environment.
