## Title: Building abstract layers for data protection and business logic
## Abstract:
### Many developers are working with direct access to the data layer of a database (tables) by ORM or .NET, Access, ... This access methode maybe a good choice for small applications which use a dedicated database where no security or business requirement is needed.

This session demonstrates the protection of data by using schemata for data protection and implementation of business logic for multiple applications. I will demonstrate the usage of schemata in an application life cycle to reuse codes for reporting in the same way as for the web application or the fat client application.
