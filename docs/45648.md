## Title: Automating Your Database Deployments
## Abstract:
### Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking as you introduce changes while attempting to protect your data. In order to take the stress out of these deployments, you must ensure that you practice your deployments before you ever get near production. This session shows how automating the deployment and testing processes through your various development and pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases â€“ what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.
