## Title: In-Memory Indexes: SpaceX® Performance!
## Abstract:
### This session does an in-depth dive into hash, range, and columnstore indexes in the in-memory environment. It will be about 25% presentation and 75% demos with emphasis on when and how to apply in-memory indexes for stated environments/scenarios. The demos will include performance comparisons to similar disk based indexes as well as the cost in RAM for the in-memory tables and storage memory for the equivalent disk based indexes.  Performance is everyone’s goal, and this session will boast your in-memory performance to Falcon Heavy® performance.
