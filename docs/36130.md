## Title: Just Enough SSIS Scripting to Be Dangerous
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services has a number of tasks and components built into the standard toolbox, however there are times the functionality you are looking for just doesn't exist.  This session will introduce you to scripting in SSIS including script tasks and the three script components types; source, destination, and transformation.  We will also discuss when to consider using custom and third party components over scripting.  This session is not meant to teach you how to develop software with C# or Visual Basic, however coding examples will be demonstrated.  Prior knowledge of programming is a benefit but not required.
