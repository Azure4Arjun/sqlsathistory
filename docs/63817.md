## Title: Slay the Legacy Leviathan... Without Modifying Application Code
## Abstract:
### Do you have that nagging feeling that your SQL Server database could be serving you better than it is?  Does the original design date back more than 5-8 years?  Do you keep hoping you could move your legacy database to the cloud but can't even get the performance you would like out of your managed hosting environment?  We've been there too! 

In this session I'll give a brief history of our SQL Server journey that started way back with version 6.5 and then I'll size up our installed user base to set the stage.  Then we'll jump right into demonstrating the process we've taken to re-tool the database in ways that have improved performance, maintenance, and user experienceâ€¦ all without changing application code!  You'll learn how to rethink your indexing scheme, naming standards,  tools like Service Broker and Temporal Tables, server setup practices, and how to log metrics that matter.

This session will give you hope and inspire you to start your own "modernizing" journey!
