## Title: Snowflake: Design Patterns  Data Integration for a Modern Cloud Warehouse
## Abstract:
### Snowflake is a data warehouse built from the ground up to take advantage of all that the cloud has to offer. Weâ€™ll take a walkthrough of the system from setup to usage and see a demonstration of how Snowflake can supercharge your BI platform. This session will show you how to rethink old design patterns to make use of ELT, not ETL, in a scalable cloud environment.
