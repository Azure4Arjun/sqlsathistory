## Title: Refactoring Monolith Database Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### We get it. Move fast and break things. Just ship it! But what's left a giant stored procedure with cursors, temp tables, and mystery calculations. It's a big black box that nobody wants to touch. Let's fix that. We'll open the lid on an example monolith and do major surgery. What's left will perform better, be easier to understand, encourage code reuse, and be easier to test.
