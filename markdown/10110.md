## Title: Decouple Database Performance from Database Capacity
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing SQL Server has many benefits, but performance isn't one of them.  Typically, I/O bottlenecks (due to storage) in a virtualized environment lead to poor and unpredictable database performance.  Throwing money at the problem by purchasing more storage hardware is often expensive, disruptive and doesn't quite solve the problem.A better way is to accelerate virtualized SQL Servers by reducing I/O latency with Flash Hypervisor software.In this session, we will discuss:.       Leveraging the virtualization platform to reduce costs and complexity of SQL Server deployments.       The performance challenges of virtualizing SQL Server.       Using Flash Hypervisor software to accelerate I/O and create high-performance SQL Servers.       Real-world results â€“ faster queries, more transactions and shorter processing times
