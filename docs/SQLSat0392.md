# Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Dave Fackler
## Title: Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduced columnstore indexing but with one major drawback -- columnstore indexes were not updateable.  Thus, adopting them to improve data warehousing (or other) query patterns took careful planning and quite a bit of management.  SQL Server 2014 introduces clustered columnstore indexes that are now fully updateable!  During this session, we'll take a look at how clustered columnstore indexes work, what implications exist for using them, and how the update process is handled.  We'll also take a look at what management and maintenance operations are required to keep clustered columnstore indexes performing optimally.  Anyone with a large data warehouse environment (or even an OLTP or ODS database with very large tables) will definitely want to attend!

## Speaker: Dan Holmes
## Title: Emulating a SELECT Trigger if Such a Thing Existed
## Abstract:
### SELECT triggers don't exist but what if they did?  What if you could capture the statement, get a parse tree, or the plan and change what happens?  What would you be able to do?  What problems could you solve? What are the limitations?  Let's go outside the box and see what we can see.  Join me on this interesting but unorthodox journey into what SQLServer can do.  You decide if it should.

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

# Closing the SSIS Package Management Story with BIPS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: PowerShell
## Speaker: Jim Christopher
## Title: Closing the SSIS Package Management Story with BIPS
## Abstract:
### Existing SSIS automation solutions are focused on forward-motion activities: creating packages and pushing them to the server.  Little or no thought is given to the management of the packages once they are in production - existing tooling offers nothing to help you understand and manage a live, money-printing ETL workflow based on SSIS packages.

BIPS is an open source project that allows you to manage a live SSIS package tree from PowerShell.  It closes the automation loop, providing the ability to learn and discover the features of an existing package deployment tree as well as manipulate it.  In short, the goal of BIPS brings a devops perspective to managing your SSIS packages.

In this session, you will learn how to leverage BIPS in your own environment.  Specific attention will be given to searching and filtering tasks and data flows on arbitrary criteria and manipulating specific parts of the ETL workflow from the shell.

# Why should I care about the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience.

# SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BIML
## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project
## Abstract:
### Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

Biml Enabled SSIS Test (BEST) [https://github.com/bimlscript/best] is an open source framework that enables users to define unit and integration tests for SSIS packages using your choice of database tables, Excel files, or XML.

In this session, you will learn how to use BEST to author your SSIS tests and how to use free open source tools to report and visualize test results as part of your existing production processes.

Note that while BEST is implemented using Biml, you do not need to learn Biml to use it.

## Speaker: Javier Guillen
## Title: Are users working against you? Manage human factors to achieve BI success
## Abstract:
### As new technology cycles emerge, we find ourselves immersed in a growing diversity of tools and infrastructures. Success in Business Intelligence, however, depends often on our capacity to increase adoption and is not always tied to the degree of engineering sophistication. 

Too often we experience adoption issues that account for partial or complete failures for BI delivery.  Are users satisfied with BI assets?  Do they continue to build information 'silos'?  Are they reluctant to change and utilize governed data sets?

In this presentation, attendees will learn about a perspective that can help increase ROI on BI delivery by actively targeting human factors critical to achieving success.

## Speaker: Sven Aelterman
## Title: Gentle Introduction to T-SQL Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Since their infancy in SQL Server 2005 and their growth spurt in SQL Server 2012, T-SQL window functions have provided new ways to solve fairly common end-user query requests. However, their successful use requires thinking a little differently about sets than you're used to. In this session, you will explore the basic concepts of ordering, partitioning and framing. Everything will be demonstrated with easy to follow examples that you will be able to adapt quickly to your query needs.

## Speaker: Justin Dearing
## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
## Abstract:
### In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed a version control system (VCS) called git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Well. whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We will cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Vis

## Abstract:
### In this day and age, with the virtualization of servers causing systems in your datacenter to multiply faster than rabbits on Viagra, how do you perform configuration management on all of those systems and the software that they run while operating on a shoestring budget? How do you detect and remediate configuration drift to stay in compliance with your organization’s standards? During this session, PowerShell MVP and scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how DSC (Desired State Configuration) can be used to perform configuration management of your systems. DSC is a new management platform in PowerShell which was introduced with WMF 4.0 that allows for the declarative configuration of systems. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.

## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Girl, Interrupted: Supporting Women's Voices - Sponsored by Intellinet
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when females at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice females are interrupted almost three times as often as their male counterparts. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This group discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

## Title: Memoirs of Building a 150 GB (and growing) SSAS Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Tabular models are an automatic choice for many customers with their in-memory capabilities and state-of-the-art data compression algorithms. Many of the models end up being 50 GB or lesser, achieving compression of 10 to 100x the database size. But if we ask many of the industry experts on what would be a safe size range for a tabular model performance wise, the most common answer is "It Depends". Join me as I take you through my journey of trying to find an answer to that. Watch and learn all the processes and rationale behind building this huge tabular model starting from size estimations and hardware selections. Contemplate on the design decisions (especially on the Multidimensional vs Tabular) and off-the-road architecture trying to balance Processing and Query performance. Watch out for some performance optimizations and development tips  tricks you definitely do not want to miss on while working on a huge tabular model.

## Title: Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR
## Abstract:
### These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.

# Design principles for robust ETL processes
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-392)
Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: ETL/SSIS
## Speaker: Rafael Salas
## Title: Design principles for robust ETL processes
## Abstract:
### Is the design of your ETL processes robust?  Does your ETL process keep you awake at night?
Data integration is still the most common point of failure of data centric projects and choosing a mature ETL tool, such as SSIS, is not enough.  In many cases this is due to improper planning and the use of questionable design principles. During this session we will look at ETL processes from a holistic point of view to identify key areas that are often neglected and that have the potential to affect the system reliability and increase its maintenance cost. We will use SSIS to evaluate key ETL architecture areas - such as re-start ability, monitoring, error handling, among others- and discuss design principles you can use to improve the architecture of your ETL processes going forward. You will find the session valuable regardless of you level of expertise in ETL.

Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: ETL/SSIS
## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Near Real-Time Data Warehouse Updates with CDC  SSIS
## Abstract:
### If you need to keep a data warehouse up-to-date in near real-time, Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution! If you are looking for a way to setup auditing of database changes, CDC is a solution! CDC has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is configured. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes in a way that can be run quickly and keep your data warehouse up-to-date.

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Continuous Delivery for Data Warehouses and Marts
## Abstract:
### Continuous delivery is an approach that enables new functionality to be delivered as needed. This session will cover how this approach can be applied to data warehouses to enable faster time to value for the consumers of the data.
Most data warehouses are in a constant state of flux. There are new requirements coming in from the business, updates and improvements to be made to existing data and structures, and new initiatives that drive new data requirements. How do you manage the complexity of keeping up with the changes and delivering new features to your business users in a timely manner, while maintaining high quality? Continuous delivery is an approach for managing this. It focuses on automation of many steps in the process, so that time is spent on adding new functionality, rather than repetitive steps. Attend this session and learn how Continuous Delivery can be applied to your data projects.

## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?
