## Speaker: Michael Moles
## Title: Introduction to Agile/Scrum
## Abstract:
### An introduction to Agile using the Scrum Process. In the past I’ve done an Agile presentation but soon learned that many people needed the basics, so I’ve created a introduction presentation. Even if you know Agile but don’t know scrum, I think you will find this presentation useful. You will learn about what a Scrum Master is vs. a Product Owner; you will understand the difference between the Team and the Stakeholders.  Lots of good stuff.
