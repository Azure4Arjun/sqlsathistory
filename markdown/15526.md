## Title: SQL Licensing White Board Session  
## Abstract:
### SQL Licensing?  How boring.  What if we told you that one of the most significant changes in SQL Server 2012 is around licensing.  Yes, software licensing can be dreadful, but one misstep could cost your company thousands of dollars! During this presentation we will NOT show a single PowerPoint slide ... instead we will whiteboard the SQL 2012 licensing changes, illustrate ways you can save money by understanding how to take advantage of virtualization rights, and we will also make sure you do NOT over license. Yes, that is correct, we will show you how to ensure you do NOT over license.
