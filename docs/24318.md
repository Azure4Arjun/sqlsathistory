## Title: Optimizing SQL Server I/O with Solid State Drives
## Abstract:
### Optimal configuration and maintenance of the I/O subsystem is critical and can ultimately be responsible for higher response times of your applications. The HDDs are by design about 1 million times slower than the memory or CPU. In this session we analyze the different options that exist for durable storage, what are their pros and cons . Solid state drives are a viable option and we are going under the covers to see how you can best use them as an alternative to a large and expensive SAN in your infrastructure
