## Speaker: Jason Horner
## Title:  Isn't that Spatial! (BI Edition)
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will walk through the process of building a spatial data
warehouse from the ground up. We will first design a basic spatial data
warehouse, then identify and import a spatial data source by using Microsoft
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and finally write a spatial query to
provide data to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). We will also review
basic concepts of working with spatial data in SQL Server.
