## Title: Quick and Dirty Push Datasets with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of different data sources.  Once you have published your data to the Power BI service, you can use an on-premises gateway to refresh your datasets up to every 15 minutes.  Power BI can also connect live to large cubes that are a result of very complex ETL and calculations.  Some of these cubes may only be refreshed daily or weekly.  For real-time streaming of data, you can use Azure Stream Analytics or the Power BI REST API.  

Have you heard of Power BI push datasets?  With push datasets, data is pushed into the Power BI service.  Since it is stored there, you can use all of Power BI's report building features with it.

In this session, I walk through the different options for real-time streaming in Power BI.  I will demonstrate setting up a push dataset and show you a very easy way to push data to Power BI using PowerShell.  I will also demonstrate a Power BI push dataset connected to a Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision app.
