## Title: Streaming Fast data with SQL Server  Azure
## Abstract:
### Providing the right data at the right time is critical to creating value from business intelligence or operational intelligence. As we record and generate a growing amount of data every millisecond, we also need to be able to understand this data just as quickly. By “Fast Data” we’re talking about as-it-happens information enabling real-time decision-making. In this session we discuss the cloud architecture of streaming technology, in Azure and on premise , with StreamInsight.
