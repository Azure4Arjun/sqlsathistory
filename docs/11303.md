## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 will allow you to significantly improve the speed of data warehousing queries without creating cubes, aggregated tables, or other techniques normally used to improve performance.  This session will show how to implement this new type of index in SQL Server and demonstrate their advantages compared to traditional solutions.  Carlos also discuss the scenarios for which columnstore indexes should be implemented instead of cubes, on top of star schemas, and with reporting tables to provide powerful but flexible BI solutions.
