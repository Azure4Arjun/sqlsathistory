## Title: DBAs are from Mars,  SharePoint admins are from Venus
## Abstract:
### SharePoint databases are considered a black box - touch them and you lose support. Furthermore, SharePoint leaves an unintelligible track of database names and GUIDs on your server.

This demo-packed session, based on real-life experiences, will show you how to tune your SQL Server for SharePoint and how to customize your SharePoint installation so that it fits your IT conventions, not the other way around.
