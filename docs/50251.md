## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Watch Brent Tune Indexes
## Abstract:
### You're not starting from scratch - you have a database that's already in production, and you can't make too many changes to the app. You want to make it go faster with as little danger and disruption as possible. You're comfortable writing queries to get the data you need, but you're not so confident when it comes to picking the right nonclustered indexes. How many should you have? What fields should they be on?

In this session, you'll learn Brent Ozar's easy one-hour process to:

* Review the indexes you've already got
* De-duplicate your indexes to make inserts/updates/deletes go faster
* Find the right nonclustered indexes you need
* And use simple, free scripts that give you all the answers
