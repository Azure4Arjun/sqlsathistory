## Title: Be in control - Policy Based Management
## Abstract:
### Getting a bit weary of developers or DBA's that cannot seem to follow well documented policies for naming conventions or server settings? Would you like to define these policies in a manner that allows SQL Server to ENFORCE them for you or, at the very least, monitor them? Policy-based management provides the ability to define policies that apply to servers, databases and other objects in your data environment. Well-defined policies can help you to control and manage change proactively.
