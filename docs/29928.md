## Title: Locking and Blocking for Developers
## Abstract:
### Locking, blocking, waits.. Why developers should care? Those things are for DBA. But what if you don't have DBA in the team? What if DBA complaints directly to your boss? 

This session will provide you an overview how SQL Server Lock Manager works; how different isolation levels affect the system; gives you bird-eye view of SQLOS and Sql Server Waits; provide you the guidelines how to minimize the locking, avoid deadlocks and improve concurrency of the system. It also shows you a couple of basic methods how to troubleshot problems related with locking and concurrency.
