## Title: Driven by the 9s - I need a highly available Microsoft Data Platform – what features should I use?
## Abstract:
### Microsoft’s data platform and SQL Server comes with a plethora of High Availability features. Some of these features can work hand-in glove with each other to allow you to configure your SQL Servers to be both Highly-Available and recoverable in the event of the worst happening. 

If you are driven by the '9s', have strict SLAs and up time is key to you and your business, then combining SQL Server’s high availability features is something you should consider. 

In this session we will look at how we can combine SQL Server Availability Groups and SQL Server Failover cluster instances to keep our servers both highly available and maintain a secondary disaster recovery.
