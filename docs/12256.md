## Title: The Next Dimension of Data
## Abstract:
### Send your data on a journey through space and time, while engaging your audience’s senses to tell its story.
MS SQL Server’s geospatial datatype offers pinpoint accuracy and many advanced location-aware capabilities, such as shapes, overlaps, distances, and direction. The Power Map feature in Office 2013 can turn your addresses and supporting figures into a movie.
Turn your facts and figures into a compelling story by entering geospace: the final frontier.
