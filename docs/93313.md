## Title: Using wait stats to determine why my server is slow
## Abstract:
### Server wait stats are a powerful tool that SQL Server gives us that provides insight into why our servers may be running slow. In this session, I will show you what role server resources (CPU, Memory, Network and Disks) play in the big picture of query processing and show you how you can use server wait stats to identify bottlenecks with these. We will also review common server waits that can occur at each crossroads of a query, reasons you may be having them and what you can do to solve the problem. The goal for this session is that you walk away with a better understanding of what wait stats are and how you can put them to use immediately.
