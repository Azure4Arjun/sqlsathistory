## Abstract:
### There is much more to life than 3rd normal form and dimensional modeling. Come explore how you can build a data warehouse solution or hybrid solution that is agile in nature. Discover this highly auditable modeling technique used in international banking, manufacturing, insurance and many more industries.  Made a mistake? No worries, own your model. Design changes happen and it can be addressed quickly avoiding pain and project delays and ultimately keeping your business happy.  Learn how to leverage Master Data Management and Azure Technologies to extend your model for performance, history and reference unstructured data. Let us bust the myth that data warehouses take too long to build and are too hard to modify by adding value to your environment and decreasing delivery time. We will explore how you can use continuous integration and delivery to further maximize value.
