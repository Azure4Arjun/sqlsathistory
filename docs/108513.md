## Title: Power BI Aggs
## Abstract:
### Power BI was originally released as a fully cloud based, end user targeted data visualization tool. Now it is a powerful, scalable enterprise level BI ecosystem. Microsoft has increased its ability to deal with large volume of data both imported into it and hosted outside the service to implement semantic models.
In this session I will demo how to design and implement agg's and take advantage of this powerful feature that will allow you to report on virtually unlimited amount of data.
