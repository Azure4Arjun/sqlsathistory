## Title: Report With Power:Bring All Your Data to the Table
## Abstract:
### By now, we have been hearing a lot about the new Power* tools.  PowerPivot, PowerView, and the  tabular data model.  But what does it all mean?  How can you put these tools to work for you?  This session provides examples of powerfully combining data from lots of different sources in creative ways, to achieve new insights.  This session will walk you through real life scenarios, using these tools to fill in missing and move from “if only” to “what if”.
