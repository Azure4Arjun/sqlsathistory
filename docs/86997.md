## Speaker: Ray Kim
## Title: Tech Writing for Techies: A Primer
## Abstract:
### Documentation is one of the most critical, yet most blatantly ignored and disrespected tasks when it comes to technology.  Businesses and technical professionals ignore documentation at their own risk.  This session discusses what tech writing and documentation is about and why it's critical for business.  It also explores possible reasons for why it's ignored, how documentation can be improved, and how "non-writers" can contribute to the process.
