## Title: Designing highly flexible PowerShell Scripts
## Abstract:
### A common practice when a script is needed for a particular task is to copy an existing script and modify it to meet a new need.  At some point, a bugs are found and fixed in the script it was found in.  After a while, there are many versions of the script, but the variations are numerous.  This session provides one method to break this cycle by creating a script that is highly flexible to the kind of variations that will exist in an environment.
