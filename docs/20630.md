## Title: Aviation Disasters - And IT Lessons From Them
## Abstract:
### What does a plane crash have to do with technical skills? You might be surprised. There are many lessons to be learned from disasters. Most accidents are caused not by one factor, but by a series of seemingly-small missteps; even if a freak accident occurs, training and preparation can make all the difference - it's the same for us! In this session weâ€™ll have a group discussion through a few actual aviation disasters and see what skills, attitudes and thought processes led to them. We'll look at some success stories and see what was different. We'll see how these attitudes and decisions impact us at work and talk about how to identify them in ourselves and our teams. Then we'll figure out how to prevent them in our day jobs.
