## Title: Data Quality Services - Cleanse  Matching intro
## Abstract:
### If you haven't seen it yet, SQL Server 2012 introduces a new feature called Data Quality Services (DQS for short). Its easy and quick to learn in an hour. DQS is useful for data stewards and IT professionals who seek to improve the quality of their business data. 

In this intro session, we describe the concept and main principles behind Data Quality Services and demo the main capabilities of the product, such as knowledge management, cleansing, matching, profiling, and the Azure Datamarket Reference Data Services.

Most any business user will quickly see the value of DQS and walk away feeling ready to show off their new found smarts to the rest of their team.
