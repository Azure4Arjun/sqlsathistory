## Title: Developing a Solution with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
## Abstract:
### If you want to launch a Python or R project with data which lives in SQL Server, SQL Server Machine Learning Services may be right for you.  In this talk, we will take a look at SQL Server Machine Learning Services, starting with an overview and installation, but quickly moving into custom development.  We will deploy packages with sqlmlutils and investigate some of the nicest features of Machine Learning Services, including native scoring and parallel processing.  We will also see how to develop and deploy custom code and tie everything back to .NET applications using stored procedures.
