## Title: Developers….Are We Just a Commodity?
## Abstract:
### It’s a contracting market.  Companies are reducing costs across the board.  With outsourcing and off-shoring achieving success, how can today’s in-house developer prove his value to the business?  Technical expertise is valuable to product and technical management. However, it’s the developer’s understanding of the business and his role in generating revenue that’s invaluable.  This presentation explains various techniques developers can use to increase their business savvy, proving they are providing value and not just an expense.
