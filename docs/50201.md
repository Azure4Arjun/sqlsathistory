## Title: Deep-Dive into Polybase of SQL Server 2016 [DE]
## Abstract:
### Polybase is a feature originally coming from APS but is now finally also available in native SQL Server 2016. It allows you to query external data sources, foremost Hadoop, directly from within SQL Server and combine it with any other data that already resides in your database. Especially the rise of the whole Hadoop data platform in the current markets makes this feature very interesting and is definitely worth a closer look. This session will guide you through the process of setting up Polybase on Hadoop and Azure Blob Stores, showing some real-world use-cases and highlight the most common pitfalls that you may encounter.
