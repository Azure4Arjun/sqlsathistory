## Title: Code Like a Pirate ... Intermediate R and Data Science in MS
## Abstract:
### This session will build on the "Code Like a Pirate ... Intro to R and Data Science Tools in MS" session. We will cover intermediate R techniques and packages around data wrangling, plotting and statistics. 

The session will work through a real data science example from Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, Model and finally Communicate your results. No prior statistics knowledge is needed just a basic understanding of R.

In this session, we will use Microsoft R Server, R Tools for Visual Studio and Power BI to work through a Data Science problem.
