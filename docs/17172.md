## Title: AlwaysOn for Multi-site  multi-subnet
## Abstract:
### Building a strong HA/DR solution with SQL Server has never been easier, however when you want to start looking at multi-site and multi-subnet clusters or Availability Groups there are some important things you need to consider. In this session I will show you how to handle some of these considerations and work though getting a reliable multi-site configuration in place without the need for things like stretch VLANs or SAN replication.

We will also look at some of the performance  failover scenarios that you might encounter and just what you should look to do when you need to go to DR.
