## Title: The Benefits of Implementing SQL Server on Cisco Unified Computing System
## Abstract:
### Join this session to learn the benefits of implementing SQL Server on Cisco Unified Compute System (UCS) for various workloads in both bare-metal and virtualized environments.  We’ll begin with an overview of Cisco UCS, then discuss deployment scenarios that follow Cisco UCS best practices and recommendations to help ensure your systems are highly available and scalable and can be efficiently consolidated and centrally managed.  We’ll cover benchmarks for both Cisco UCS blade and rack-mount servers as well. You’ll walk away from the session with a fundamental understanding of the hardware and software components and the configurations required for a successful SQL Server implementation on Cisco UCS.
