## Speaker: Jonathan Walz
## Title: PowerScripting Live! (PowerShell podcast / BoF)
## Abstract:
### Do you listen to podcasts? It's like the radio, but more Internetty. Well, Atlanta just so happens to be the home to the two co-hosts of the PowerScripting Podcast, the first podcast devoted to talking about Windows PowerShell. We have news, interviews, tips and resources that we present every week at powerscripting.net, but this time, the show is coming to you live! We'll come prepared to hit most any general PowerShell topic you want, and we'll probably sneak some SQL + PowerShell experts on stage to help out. This won't be a canned lecture, it will be more of a Birds of a Feather or talk show feel. Audience participation is REQUIRED!
