## Title: From SQL to R â€“ Leverage Your T-SQL Knowledge to Learn R
## Abstract:
### You are already familiar with T-SQL and are eager to learn R but do not know, where to start? Start from what you already know: T-SQL. Both languages have many things in common on some levels, but are very different on others. This session will kick you off to the new language by using analogies from T-SQL. You will learn how to write your first R-scripts, make usage of packages and will leave this session with a basic understanding of typical use-cases of R and how to integrate that into your existing environment with SQL Server.
