## Speaker: Ben Miller
## Title: Inside the SQLPS PowerShell Module
## Abstract:
### SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.

## Speaker: Dale Cunningham
## Title: Creating an Always On Distributed Availability Group
## Abstract:
### Always On has developed and matured into an effective HA/DR solution with SQL 2016.  Most enterprise DBAs have built a cluster and installed Always On Availability Groups (AOAG), this session will take the Always On technology one step further and discuss the new features in SQL 2016 that will allow a DBA to have live, read only database replicas in a geographically diverse location, in a completely different domain cluster and as a member of a completely separate Availability Group (AG).  This session will go through the steps of identifying the pre-requisites, limitations and installation steps to setup a Distributed Availability Group from start to finish! Come and watch how to do it!

# SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#576-Salt-Lake-City-2016)
Event Date: 19-11-2016 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: J May
## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On Availability Groups Perf  Internals
## Abstract:
### Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. 

Our work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.

## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: PowerBI, from a DBA
## Abstract:
### Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

You will be given permissions to an Azure DB, and get connected to this source. You will also need to have PowerBI desktop downloaded and installed. We will be using this to create the report during the session. So please come prepared to interact with the internet, with a cloud-based database you will be provided, and PowerBI Desk

# Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#576-Salt-Lake-City-2016)
Event Date: 19-11-2016 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

# Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#576-Salt-Lake-City-2016)
Event Date: 19-11-2016 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

# Database Restore Testing...Automated
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#576-Salt-Lake-City-2016)
Event Date: 19-11-2016 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Robert Every
## Title: Database Restore Testing...Automated
## Abstract:
### How do we know the backup files of our databases are free from corruption?  Why would we care?  The hardware storing the backup files is reliable…right?  What could possible go wrong?  Right?  The only way to know our database backup files are in good order is to validate them.  How do we do that?  One way is to restore the databases from those backup files and check the integrity of the restored databases.  This session will show some benefits of database restore testing and walk through the code of a SQL Agent job that automates it.
