## Title: Data Visualisation with Hadoop Mashups, Power View and Excel 2013
## Abstract:
### The Hadoop ecosystem is a valuable tool for Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation practitioners. It allows you to mashup unstructured data from Hadoop with structured data from more traditional relational and multi-dimensional sources. For Business Intelligence practitioners, this is an excellent tool to gain new business insights, and overcome data silos that come from within the organisation, whilst freeing you to make use of external data sources too.
Join us at this session in order to see how your Big Data can empower your business users via familiar Business Intelligence tools such as Excel and Power View.
