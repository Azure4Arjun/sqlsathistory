## Title: Improving Database Code Quality with Unit Tests
## Abstract:
### You're a developer or DBA who cares about code quality, but you don't have automated testing for your T-SQL code --- yet. That's about to change!

In this session, you will learn how to unit test your T-SQL code. You will learn how to build unit tests into your own development environment. You'll see demonstrations of how to create and run unit tests to confirm functionality of database objects using test driven design. You'll leave the session with a knowledge of which tools help you create unit tests for SQL Server and a checklist of how to get started writing your first tests.
