## Title: All things you need to know before you start setting up SQL AlwaysOn
## Abstract:
### Running the Availability Group Wizard, or installing a clustered SQL instance can go pretty smoothly.  But in complex and larger networks, that is not always the case.  Even if the wizards complete without error and you think you have a highly available system, you may not.  
This session will review all the gotchaâ€™s and things you need to know before you run the shiny wizard or run some PowerShell to make your HA/DR implementation of SQL a success.
