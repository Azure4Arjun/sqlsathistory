## Speaker: Saggi Neumann
## Title: Big Data: Become a data engineer or kick the bucket!
## Abstract:
### As a long time database consultant, and the current CTO of Xplenty, I've seen many organizations taking in new data technologies and handling the changes with various degrees of success, as well as how these changes affected the data team within the organization.

In this talk I'll discuss the rapid technological changes in the Big Data and NoSQL world and the implications to a business adopting these technologies. 

One outcome of adopting big data technology is that it's not easily accessible to people who touch data on a daily basis, which may quickly become a bottleneck in the organization. Turning into a full-fledged Data Engineer can be challenging, but it is possible. I'll discuss the skills DBAs and BI people need to learn and unlearn in order to work under new data paradigms. I will also review various new and emerging tools as well as integration with older platforms that allow for smoother migration into the new world.
