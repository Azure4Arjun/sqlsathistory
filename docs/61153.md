## Title: SQL lessons learned operating at scale
## Abstract:
### When your SQL Server environment runs 24*7 and is *very sensitive* to interruptions, how one performs basic maintenance activities, supports development and deployment, and ensures proper backups requires a different mindeset for performing these tasks.
Everything from how you implement SQL Server to how a table is designed requires a different thought process when the daily "overnight" or weekly "downtime" windows do not exist.  
Everything you do happens alongside and impacts user-facing activity.
In this session I will present various high-level lessons learned along the path of user happiness in an always-in-use environment.
