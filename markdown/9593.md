## Title: Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan
## Abstract:
### What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!
