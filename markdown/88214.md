## Title: Multitenancy â€“ from zero to it works!
## Abstract:
### With the evolution of the Internet in recent years, more and more services are provided online. The need to have as many installations as customers is replaced by the strategy to have a single service/product usable by different customers at the same time: this is called "multitenancy". In this session we will see why approaching this architecture and the various ways of how to implement it. At the end the "wow" effect, with a simple demo we will see that you can really do it using the ShardMapManager of Azure SQLDatabase.
