## Speaker: Saso Koren
## Title: SSAS in multi-lingual environments: tips  tricks
## Abstract:
### Developing a SSAS solution for multi-lingual environments requires some additional attention. It's not just the SSAS objects (measures, dimensions, etc.) that need to be translated. There are a lot of details: How to best handle translations of junk dimension members (statuses, codes, etc.)? And what about different regional formatting (dates, numbers)? How to handle multiple currencies?
