## Title: HDInsight: Big Data solutions on Microsoft Azure
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure HDInsight is a big data solution based on the open-source Apache Hadoop framework, and is an integral part of the Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics product range. We will explore the use of HDInsight in a range of use cases and scenarios such as a data warehouse, for ETL processes, and integration into existing BI systems. We will review the concepts of big data, planning and designing big data solutions, and implementing these solutions.
