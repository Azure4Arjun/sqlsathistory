## Title: Create a Power BI Dashboard in 90 Minutes or LESS
## Abstract:
### Power BI is quickly outpacing Excel as the one tool needed for self-service Business Intelligence. In this session we'll walk through Microsoft's exciting new Power BI SaaS offering, creating some Reports and Dashboards along the way. We'll explore some of the ready-made content packs for major SaaS providers such as Salesforce or Google Analytics, then create our own based on an Azure SQL Database. Next, we'll explore Power BI Desktop, a powerful new tool for creating advanced analytic data models and authoring reports using familiar experiences from the best of Excel's BI components.  Finally, we'll deploy the reports to Power BI, extend and share our Dashboard, and configure Automatic Data Refresh. All inside 90 minutes! Don't miss this session on the cutting edge of Microsoft's self-service Business Intelligence offering.
