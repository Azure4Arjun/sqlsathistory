## Title: Managing Multiple SQL Servers Using SSMS
## Abstract:
### Do you want to be able to monitor multiple database servers using SSMS, and execute commands such as checking which servers have a specific login, run a DBCC command on 50 servers at the same time, select records from multiple servers as a single output, identify blocking commands on your SQL Server farm, or even check the error log of multiple servers using a single SQL command? What about sending a SMS when the 'sa' user is currently connected?
Now you can do this and more with Enzo Unified, the data server platform that unleashes the power of SQL Server.
