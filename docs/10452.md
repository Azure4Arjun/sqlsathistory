## Title: Type More, Click Less:  Programmatically build SSIS packages
## Abstract:
### Developing repetitive strain injury (RSI) from all those mouse clicks in Business Intelligence Development Studio/SQL Server Data Tools? Longing to automate the tedium in SQL Server Integration Services package creation? In this session, we’ll explore the Integration Services object model and learn how to create rich packages without ever clicking our mouse. You’ll learn about the basic object model, the EzAPI wrapper for it, as well as using BIMLScript to build moderately complex packages.
