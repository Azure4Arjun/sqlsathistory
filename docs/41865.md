## Title: TSQL Coding Techniques - Are You Playing with Fire?
## Abstract:
### The good news? T-SQL is one of the easiest coding languages to learn. 
The bad news? Writing scalable T-SQL that performs optimally is an art that takes years to master. 
In this session, learn about some common T-SQL Troublemakers - Looping, Scalar Functions, Implicit Conversions, Non-Parameterized SQL and Parameter Sniffing.
Through examples and demos in this session you will witness the situational pitfalls of the techniques above. With each demo, you will be given an alternate T-SQL solution that solves the same problem in an efficient and scalable manner. Let's get things moving!
