## Speaker: Craig Porteous
## Title: DIY ETL with Logic apps, Azure Functions and more
## Abstract:
### How do we handle the edge cases, the unique or temporary solutions to get data from emails, file shares, FTP, someone's desktop etc? 
We need DIY ETL when the easy data sources don't exist, and the usual methods won't work.
In this session, we'll take 3 scenarios, solve them and make them reliable, and repeatable, with tools like Power Automate, logic apps, Azure functions and more.
