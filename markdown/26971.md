## Title: Master Data Management Using MDS on SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Master Data Services was introduced to the SQL suite starting with 2008 R2. The product is for managing "Master Data" or data that is core to the business process; the 'nouns' of the business; the 'who' and the 'what'. The 2012 version has undergone some major improvements.

In this session we'll discuss the philosophy of "Master Data Management" and how an MDS implementation is NOT a Data Warehouse, but can certainly enhance one.  We'll dive into the two popular user interface choices and options of the product to help you understand how you can get the best out of it. We'll set up a basic model during the demo and also take a peak under the covers to see some what we can touch inside the database, and what is dangerous ground.
