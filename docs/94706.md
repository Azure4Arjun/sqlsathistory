## Title: Your SQL Servers are Mi$ConFiguReDed
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Servers are misconfigured!

And it is probably not your fault.

90% of the SQL Servers I have seen in my 18 year career are just wrong. Not “crash” or “won’t start” wrong. More like “why is the website so slow” wrong.
 

We are going to roll through a clean install and look at some things that can be made right during the install. And then we will look at some configurations that can only be done after the install.

Things like:
·        Instant File Initialization
·        Backup Compression
·        MAXDOP
·        TempDB configuration
·        Cost Threshold for Parallelism
·        And more if we have time!

Fair warning…I’m going to overuse the phrase “It Depends”

Dallas DBAs is dedicated to helping you find these issues, test them, remediate them and get the most stability, reliability and performance out of your SQL Server.
