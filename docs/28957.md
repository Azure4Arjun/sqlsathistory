## Speaker: Ayad Shammout
## Title: PowerPivot for Excel and SharePoint 2010
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will cover PowerPivot - a data analysis add-in that delivers computational power directly within MS Excel 2010. By combining native Excel 2010 functionality with PowerPivotâ€™s in-memory engine, I will interactively explore and perform calculations on very large data sets. This session gives the user the freedom to learn the many uses of PowerPivot from importing, modeling, analyzing and pivoting millions of records to publishing to SharePoint. I will show how IT staff can track and monitor user generated PowerPivot workbooks in SharePoint and explore PowerPivot Management Dashboard.
