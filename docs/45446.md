## Title: FROM OLD TO NEW; NAVIGATING THE CHOPPY WATERS OF A CRM/ERP PLATFORM MIGRATI
## Abstract:
### The time has come -- you’ve lived with your legacy Customer Relationship Management/Enterprise Resource Planning systems since you joined the company, but they’re not cutting it anymore. A decision is made to move to a new vendor, a new platform, a new CRM/ERP software package, and you’ve been tapped to be part of the project team. Your job will be to make sure that the data collected in the old systems is successfully and accurately ported to the new systems. Really?

What do you have to look forward to? What’s it going to be like? How are you going to do this? Will you port all of the data from the legacy system to the new one, or just some? How will that work?

Join Michelle Poolet as she walks you through lessons learned from the many platform migrations that she’s been part of. As a data architect, Michelle has special insight into these massively complex projects, which she’d like to share with you.
