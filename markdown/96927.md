## Title: How to establish control when it's all going wrong!
## Abstract:
### At some point in time, whether in the past or in the future, we will experience being in a situation where there is a major outage or problem that needs to be dealt with. But how can we ensure that it does not decend into chaos and make the problem worse?

Join me as I share a number of tips and tricks about how to take control of the situation. We will cover establishing a control structure, commuincations, and documentation. All of which when done well can result in a calm and controlled resolution and faciliate root cause analysis. We will also look at ways to prepare for such situations and how you can lay the groundwork so that if something does go wrong you are ready for it.
