## Title: The Magic of SQL Server 2012 BI in SharePoint
## Abstract:
### This fast paced and fun session is a journey through business intelligence with SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint.  It begins in Excel and shows how PowerPivot can be used to build useful information, how the data can be fed to the desktop, and how a user can develop their own notifications from that data. It then moves on to transform the data into a more cube-like experience by using external data and shows how dashboards and presentation-quality visualisations can be built easily from tabular models.

Although this session is mildly technical, it is easy to grasp and uses 100% demos.
