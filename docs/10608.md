## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2014 OTHER THAN Hekaton?
## Abstract:
### When asked about new features in the SQL Server 2014 Database Engine, people tend to only think of one thing: In-Memory OLTP, commonly known by its code-name "Hekaton." While In-Memory OLTP is a great improvement, many other features may prove more helpful for day-to-day database activity. This session will investigate the other new features offered in 2014, including delayed durability, buffer pool extension, enhancements to backups, partitioning, statistics, columnstore indexes, security, and much more!
