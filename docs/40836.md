## Title: Taking the Scare out of Monster Reports
## Abstract:
### So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report. It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities. And of course, they want it to be pretty as well.

This session discusses how to use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to bring it all together while avoiding pitfalls and mistakes. The demonstration shows you how to build a multipage, dashboard-style report to manage your report server, showing a multitude of grids and charts. Discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.
