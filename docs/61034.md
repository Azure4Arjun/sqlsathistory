## Title: Database Continuous Delivery  Your Salvation!
## Abstract:
### Continuous Integration  Delivery isn’t a new concept.  Application Developers have been doing it for quite a while and now it’s time for Database Professionals to catch up.  Whether you are a database administrator, database developer, or even an application developer, database continuous delivery can help you find your salvation. I'll show you how to apply these concepts to areas of security, collaboration, testing, support and deployments.   We will look at what continuous delivery means, demonstrate some tools that can help you easily get it into place, and dive into why it’s important.
