## Title: Dealing with Data Quality Issues in an SSIS Data Flow
## Abstract:
### Anyone who has worked with SSIS has dealt with the frustration of poor data quality and cryptic error messages. Microsoft has gotten better at providing better error messages within the Data Flow task, but still falls short in some areas.  In this session we will discover how to get the real error message in a data flow task and how to isolate the rows causing the errors.  We will start by reviewing a solution developed using a script component and progress to a method used to identify data quality issues before an error occurs.  We will also discuss other options to handling data quality and errors.
