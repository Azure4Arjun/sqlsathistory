## Speaker: Michael Sexton
## Title: ETL as MDM
## Abstract:
### Companies store data in multiple diverse formats on multiple databases using multiple versions of software and none of it is designed to integrate of work together… until that it gets to the BI systems. In the BI system data suddenly must – as if by magic - become a fully integrated and logically coherent system to generate reports for executives.  This session will explore the Master Data Management (MDM) default system for many companies, their BI stack and how we can use the ETL process to get a single version of truth for corporate data.
