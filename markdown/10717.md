## Title: Using Event Notifications with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Event Notifications are a great tool often not used by DBA's. I will show you how this is a good introduction into the world of Service Broker and why it is better than triggers or SQL Trace. I will demo a practical use of auditing that we use in Kiwibank that you can take away and use yourself.
