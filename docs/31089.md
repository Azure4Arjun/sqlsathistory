## Title: Using MS Access as a BI Tool with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Access is a wonderful BI analysis tool. It allows users to leverage the native capabilities for Crosstab queries along with some powerful UI mechanisms to provide a rich BI environment. In this session I'll be using VBA and SQL Server to extend the tools even further:
We will cover three topics: Creating a Access dashboard using a SQL Server stored procedure; creating a Crosstab analysis with subtotals in table format and creating a flexible Crosstab analysis using Access's Crosstab table form. You will walk away with new methods to do BI analysis using the World's most popular desktop database.
