## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Designing for Common Problems in SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will do a design and code review of several common patterns of solving problems that a typical programmer will come up against. Problems like coding for hierarchical data, data driven design, dealing with image data, structure generalization, user specified schemas, dimensional reporting, and dealing with uniqueness beyond what you might deal with using a simple uniqueness constraint might allow you to deal with.
