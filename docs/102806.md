## Title: Advancing Databricks - Next Level ETL
## Abstract:
### Azure Databricks has been around for a while now, and Apache Spark since 2012. You've watched a couple of demos, got a brief overview of what Databricks does and you've got a rough idea of where it fits in… but where do you go from there?

This session is that next stop. We'll start by taking a deeper look inside the spark engine, understanding what makes it tick and how it talks to data. We'll then break down some of the key features that come together to build the kind of data processing task that's changing how we think about ETL.

We'll be looking at:
 - RDDs  How data is stored
 - Schema Inference
 - Storing Metadata
 - Parameters in Notebooks
 - Integration with Data Factory

Each of these features comes together to build a single, generic notebook that can validate the rows within a dataset that meet a specific structure, and it's all driven by metadata!

We'll be doing everything in python, so a light familiarity will help but is not mandatory
