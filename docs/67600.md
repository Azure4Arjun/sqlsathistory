## Title: Azure Data Lake : SELECT People FROM DataLake WHERE Happy = TRUE
## Abstract:
### Discover Azure Date Lake through a complete demo : how to get insights from tons of text, photos and videos ? From different media files and raw data, we will analyze sentiment of characters and get valuable information in a Power BI dashboard, using Cognitive Services, CNTK, .NET and U-SQL.
This session will mainly showcase Azure Data Lake and U-SQL language. But demos will involve different tools like Azure Data Factory for data supply chain and orchestration, Azure SQL Datawarehouse for corporate data and also Azure Machine Learning and Power BI.
Even if this session is demo-driven, we won't omit to present you concepts and features of Azure Data Lake.
