## Speaker: Christophe Laporte
## Title: From Docker to Big Data Clusters: a new era for SQL server
## Abstract:
### Starting with version 2017, SQL server was supported on Docker and Linux. With SQL Server 2019, you will be able to run a container, or a whole AlwaysOn Availability Group on Kubernetes.
This session will drive DBAs on their path to modernize their skills. Starting with a single container on a Docker host, the session will also cover Big Data Cluster creation and usage though T-SQL and basic Python scripts.
