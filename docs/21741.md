## Title: SQL Server 2012 over NAS Storage
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is one of the most commonly virtualized applications environments. With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft introduces full support for SMB. Now you can install SQL Server 2012 with both system and user databases on SMB file shares.  This allows you to build end-to-end NAS solutions where the data management capabilities of NAS, such as volume auto grow and shrink.  This session will demonstrate how to install and run SQL Server over SMB and VMware NFS on NetApp storage as well as best practices, caveats, and performance of SQL Server database over NAS storage.
