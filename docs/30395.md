Event Date: 19-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Ira Warren
## Title: (SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Matchi
## Abstract:
### We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). There are many facets to review. I would like to start by drawing concepts from several articles from experienced practitioners, either from academia or the commercial market. They will be footnoted at the end of the session. Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms
