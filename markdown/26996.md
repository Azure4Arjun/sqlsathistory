### In this session we'll be integrating a variety of geospatial data sources to provide a scalable website using a Windows Azure SQL Database and it's built in Geospatial features such as nearest neighbour. Then we'll take this a step further and introduce another live data stream, finally rendering it all using Bing Maps to an Azure Website.
