## Speaker: Paul te Braak
## Title: Perception, Heuristics  Visualisation Cues
## Abstract:
### It’s the end of the day you’re tired – there’s no shame in that.  Still, your presentation needs to make an impact so that the audience understands and remembers your content.  How do you display that data so that it is effectively absorbed?

This presentation looks at the display mechanisms for information.  We delve into our visual cues and our cognitive patterns to understand how our minds interpret what we see so that, when we choose a graphic, we can choose the most effective visualization for our content and meaning of information being presented. 
 
We look at which visualization techniques work and why less is sometimes more.
