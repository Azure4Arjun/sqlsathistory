## Title: Sql Server Architecture for World Domination
## Abstract:
### It's common to start with a small database server; but when activity increases, how do you know when to scale? This session will cover scaling Sql Server from express to enterprise and VM to a scale-out HADR architecture. You'll learn common upgrade and migration techniques along with things to keep in mind when building new environments. We'll start with a stand alone server and work our way up to a large scale out and scale up deployment.
