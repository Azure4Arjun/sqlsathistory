## Title: Crash Course in Dependency Injection
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce the concept of dependency injection to those that are unfamiliar or have little experience in the area. It will cover some basic use cases and code examples in displaying firsthand the benefits of implementing dependency injection, common "gotchas", etc. It will also go over some of the most popular .NET IoC libraries and help get first time users off their feet. This session will focus on C# specifically, although the dependency injection concept is universal.
