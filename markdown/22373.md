## Title: Exploiting Excel Cube Functions in your Reports and Dashboards
## Abstract:
### A best kept secret, cube functions retrieve data from Analysis Services cubes and Power Pivot data models. Flexibility of formatting and layout (any cell, anywhere) make cube functions ideal for building Excel dashboards and reports requiring very specific placement.
This session introduces the seven cube functions, while focusing on those most useful. Live demos will highlight report building techniques, practical considerations, leveraging MDX, legacy report migration, text data retrieval from Power Pivot and more.
