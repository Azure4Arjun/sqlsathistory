## Title: If a computer can understand, why can't YOU understand Azure Cognitive Services?
## Abstract:
### Cognitive services can recognise objects, faces, describe images, understand speech, perform advanced searches and so much more.
If you are a developer and know nothing about Azure Cognitive Services for free, this is a good place to start.
Disclaimer: Cognitive services will never guess a doctor's handwriting. That's just impossible.
