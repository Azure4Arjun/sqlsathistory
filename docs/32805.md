## Title: Aspect EntityFramework for SqlAzure best practices
## Abstract:
### When talking to Sql Azure there are some best practices you are supposed to follow.  Things like batching and retrying on connection failure.  There are well documented ways to do this using ADO.NET.  However more and more applications are being written using Entity Framework rather than ADO.NET.  If we are using Entity Framework how do we follow those best practices?
