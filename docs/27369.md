## Title: SQL for Developers with SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### : It’s about time developers can use Visual Studio tools when it comes database development in a quality manner. Let’s see how we can work in a single environment when we implement our application code and DB structure and functionality, all in a complemented way with code navigation, IntelliSense, platform-specific validation, debugging and declarative editing in the TSQL Editor, as well as a visual Table Designer.
