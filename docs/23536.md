## Speaker: Rasmus Reinholdt
## Title: Taking your application to memory
## Abstract:
### Based on our work with converting an existing application to memory optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures this session, will take you through this journey and show you the (large) gaps between what we have in our normal SQL belt and what is possible in Natively compiled stored procedures. I will show how to overcome all the gaps and get all out normal stuff to work in these monster fast procedures â€“ even the things that the documentation says cannot be done.

You will therefore be taken through the concept of in-memory tables and what to be aware of when considering converting your database tables and code to In-Memory tables and through a life migration demo be given all the tips and tricks I picked up while doing so. After attending this session, you will be able to leverage on the new concepts and work your way around its current limitations to gain enormous speed increase and a lock-free environment.
