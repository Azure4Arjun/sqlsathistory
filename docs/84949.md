## Title: Working Smarter by Using Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Do you ever find yourself needing to rank the results of your queries? Maybe you need to calculate averages for specific groups within your data, or maybe you would like to include lag values in your output. These needs and many others can often be satisfied using window functions, a set of functions that can perform multi-row calculations while maintaining all of the original rows of your output.
In this session, you will learn how to use window functions in your queries. You'll also see some typical window function use cases and you'll get to look at some common mistakes people make with window functions so you can avoid them yourself. If you can write a query that uses a simple join, then these functions may be the next tool to add to your repertoire.
