## Title: What is kusto query language?
## Abstract:
### As data professionals makes progress in their migration to cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella ‘Azure Monitor’. One of the primary sources of monitoring is ‘Azure Monitor logs’ (which is also knows as Log Analytics). Azure Monitor logs are built on Azure Data Explorer which uses the Kusto query language. Going forward, the Kusto language should be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.  In this demo intensive session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using Kusto.

I have invested a lot of effort and received expert advice from Microsoft Engineers in learning how to work with Azure Monitor Log.  Sharing what I have learned is going to save time and effort for anyone that will be responsible for managing resources in Azure.
