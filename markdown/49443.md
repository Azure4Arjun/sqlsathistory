## Title: Securing SQL Server, Patterns and Practices
## Abstract:
### Security is at the forefront of many organizations minds, but there are many options to choose from and getting a security configuration right can take time and effort. Let me give you a head start when it comes to helping secure your SQL Servers from the malicious, inquisitive, and opportunists.

Starting with a good security baseline configuration that you can then build on is vital, it provides a strong foundation on which to build more robust configurations. I will show you how to secure data during transmission, and at rest, demonstrating how to get Manages Service Accounts to work for your systems. From here we look at securing systems for PCI-DSS and PII that falls under the data protection act, two of the main compliance requirements encountered today.

After attending this session, you will be in a strong position to effectively secure your SQL Server systems.

Security should be the rule, not the exception, together we can make this happen.
