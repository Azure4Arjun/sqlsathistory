## Title: Batch Mode Parallel Query Execution
## Abstract:
### A completely new model for parallel query execution known as "batch mode" was introduced in SQL Server 2012 and significantly enhanced in
SQL Server 2014. This session will describe the benefits of batch mode parallel execution, how it works, how to analyze the execution plans
it produces, and how to write queries and design databases to take full advantage of this new technology.
