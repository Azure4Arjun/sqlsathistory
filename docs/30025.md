## Title: Seven Benefits of Virtualization
## Abstract:
### The time to virtualize your entire datacenter is now. The seven primary benefits of virtualization will be discussed: OpEx reductions from improved manageability, near 100% reliable disaster recoverability, product release cycle optimization, high availability, license optimization and hardware-based software licensing, production error capture, and security considerations. Tier-1 virtualization should be embraced, and virtualization is ready. High availability for the C-level and our observation of the current virtualization trends will also be examined.
