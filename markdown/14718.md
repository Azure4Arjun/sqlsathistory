## Title: Power BI in Office 365

### In this session we will explore the power of Power QA in Office 365. We'll look at getting data into O365 enabling it for QA and then using Power QA on that data. We'll then switch to Sample Data available in Office 365 to demo some capabilities with a larger data set.
