## Title: The Leader in Server-Side Storage Intelligence 
## Abstract:
### Storage bottlenecks are consistently the root cause of application performance issues in virtualized data centers.  Solving this problem via traditional storage architectures can be costly, inefficient, and provide lackluster results.  PernixData software puts storage intelligence into high speed server media, enabling a decoupled storage architecture that optimizes VM performance while leveraging any shared storage for capacity.  Benefits of PernixData software include: •      Fast VM performance: Fault tolerant read and write acceleration using server flash and RAM.•      Flexible data center design: Decouple storage performance from capacity to minimize hardware costs.•      Seamless deployment and operations:  100% software – No changes to VMs, hosts, or storage; No rip and replace of existing hardware.
