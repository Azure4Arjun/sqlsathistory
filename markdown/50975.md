## Title: Are Temporal Tables The Better CDC?
## Abstract:
### YEAH - SQL Server 2016 introduces the first time support for system-versioned temporal tables as a database feature that brings built-in support for providing information about data stored in the table at any point in time. "Temporal Tables" was a feature many developers had on their wish list for Microsoft SQL Server.

Before "Temporal Tables" Change Data Capture (CDC) has been used for the "storage of temporal data". Although the core concepts of CDC didn't had the focus on Temporal Tables it was a really good tool for its implementation.

See in this demo-heavy session both techniques will all there pros and cons. Make your personal opinion what technique is the right one for you and which one will make you crazy!
