## Title: ETL from the Trenches: SSIS in the Real World
## Abstract:
### Sure you've read the SSIS books. And sure you've seen a lot of SSIS presentations. But how do you put it all together to create a solid ETL framework for loading your data warehouse environment? In this session, we'll look at the ins and outs of a real-world ETL environment built using SSIS. We'll discuss the SSIS design patterns used to handle a multi-tiered data warehouse environment with multiple data sources, different loading schedules, and several different data transformation requirements. We'll also discuss how the development team responsible for the ETL environment at the Department of Veterans Affairs handles package auditing and logging, team development, package testing, and automated deployments.

# Why Data Warehousing Projects Fail
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#23---Louisville-2009)
Event Date: 24-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Craig Utley
## Title: Why Data Warehousing Projects Fail
## Abstract:
### Is your organization planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution? Data warehousing projects, like many large IT projects, have high failure rates. While the exact rate of failure for data warehousing projects is difficult to pin down, the causes of these failures fall into a small number of categories. It is obviously possible to successfully complete a data warehousing project and deliver value to the business. Craig Utley has seen Microsoft BI solutions in various states of completeness at over 30 companies worldwide and has seen some awesome successes and some spectacular failures. This session addresses the reasons data warehousing projects fail and how you can succeed in overcoming these obstacles.

## Speaker: Craig Utley
## Title: Do It Right: Best Practices for Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Are you seeking practical, in-depth technical advice for building a BI solution using SSAS? Analysis Services changed tremendously with the advent of SQL Server 2005. It introduced a new way of building dimensions and cubes that required a new way of modeling the solution. This session examines the best practices for properly designing cubes for performance and usability. It discusses some high-level topics but also looks at advanced topics such as alternative approaches to many-to-many dimensions, SCOPE statements, aggregation design, scalability issues, processing techniques, server properties, and more.

## Title: Analysis Services 2008 End-to-End
## Abstract:
### Are you interested in designing, building, and deploying an Analysis Services database that follows best practices and best delivers value to your organization? This session goes through the process of optimizing cube creation through the proper design of dimensions, measure groups, aggregations, calculations, perspectives, security, and more. The areas of source code control, deployment, promotion from test to production, processing efficiency, and other areas will be discussed. Far from a theoretical discussion, this seminar will present real-world lessons learned about what works in production environments.

# SQL Server 2008: Extended Events

## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: SQL Server 2008: Extended Events
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 provides a plethora of diagnostic tools from which you can wield as a DBA to diagnose problems within your database systems. Extended Events is an extended event handling system that parallels much of the functionality of SQL Trace. The one MAJOR difference is that Extended Events is highly scalable and configurable system that allows the administrator to collect as little or as much data as they wish in order to identify a possible problem. This session will focus on looking at the Extended Events architecture, how it works, how to use it, and some tools that may help you along the way.

## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: Powershell in SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### Powershell is one of the wild fire pieces running through the Microsoft landscape right now.  With its semi-integration with SQL Server 2008 it provides a powerful scripting environment for those people whom are looking for a more traditional route of automation other than .NET. Additionally, most administrative functions are merely a repetitive sequence of tasks that you do over and over again. This talk will consist of an introduction to the Powershell environment as seen through the DBAs eyes and demonstrate some scripts that can help you manage your environment.

# the XML Capabilities of SQL Server 2008
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#23---Louisville-2009)
Event Date: 24-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Jason Follas
## Title: the XML Capabilities of SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### XML-based data is very prevalent in today's data world to the point that every database developer should know how to work with XML. Middle-tier translation of XML into relational data may be inflexible, and often leads to a loss of fidelity over time. One solution is to move the XML handling into the database itself in order to improve overall integration. SQL Server 2005 provides powerful XML processing features that allow easy access to data stored within XML without sacrificing any of the original fidelity.

## Speaker: Jason Follas
## Title: Demystifying Transact-SQL 
## Abstract:
### Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is the language of SQL Server, and is literally used for everything from defining database objects to querying data from a database.  In this primer, essential T-SQL syntax will be explained to demonstrate how to work with data in progressively complex ways.  Also demonstrated will be how to write functions and stored procedures to handle more complex requirements, as well as some of the more powerful features of the T-SQL language itself.  Finally, we’ll see examples of how to consume the results of a query from .NET using ADO.NET.

## Speaker: Sarah Barela
## Title: Scalable SQL Server Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Learn how Hyper-V can provide on-demand scalability and improved resource utilization specifically for the unique SQL Server workload characteristics. We will discuss how to use Resource Governor to guarantee predictable performance, as well as, how to automate the allocation of resources based on the servers current performance, and how to contain problem processes. Finally, we will discuss how the Data Collector can be used to provide constant information about the health of the cloud to itself and to the DBA. Throughout the session, we will demonstrate how these ideas work together to create a new SQL Server infrastructure that will change as your needs change.
