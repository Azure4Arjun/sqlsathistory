## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: Machine Learning: Using R and SQL together
## Abstract:
### Is “R” worth the time to learn?  What tools will enable me to start?  What can I do with “R” if I learn it?  How much “R” do I have to know before I can use it?  This session will begin to answer these questions.  Almost exclusively demo, we will walk through the use of several visualization techniques to understand and shape data for the purpose of applying Machine Learning Models to make predictions.  Focused on “Binary classification” we will use two predictive algorithms:  rxFastLinear and a Gradient Boosting Machine to model Florida Traffic accidents.  MS Visual Studio is the tool of choice utilizing Microsoft’s R client.
