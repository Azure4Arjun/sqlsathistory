## Title: Managing Complex Workloads Using the SQL Server 2014 Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### The Resource Governor is a key SQL Server technology for managing competing workloads. New capabilities designed to provide greater flexibility in resource management have been added in SQL Server2012 and SQL Server 2014. As organizations consolidate their SQL architectures, effective management of compute and disk resources becomes more difficult. This session will detail Resource Governor functions as well as demos to illustrate advanced workload management using the SQL 2014 Resource Governor.
