## Title: Use Docker to Deploy SQL Server Applications
## Abstract:
### Docker can not only be used for testing purposes, but also for deploying applications. The big advantage for the customer of the application is that nothing has to be installed, there are no obstacles to the application running in the given environment etc. because the environment is defined by the developer. German Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler will show how all of this can be achieved by using docker. There will be plenty of demos in which all the necessary steps will be shown.
