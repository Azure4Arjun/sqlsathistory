## Speaker: Wyn Hopkins
## Title: Making the leap from Excel formulas to DAX
## Abstract:
### DAX is easy until it's hard.   The same thing applies to Excel formulas.   The advantage of Excel is you can see exactly which cells are being referenced and you see the immediate answer of your calculation.
DAX formulas are written in isolation with the author having to "picture" the context of where that calculation will be used.
This session compares and contrasts calculations in Excel formulas and DAX formulas to give you a better comprehension on how to tackle DAX.
Tips, tricks and best practice ideas will set you up for more powerful Excel and Power BI reporting.
