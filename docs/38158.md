## Title: All about Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### The key to understanding how SQL Server is processing your queries is the execution plan. 

This full day session focuses on the execution plan. We'll look at the compile process, how and why plans are stored in cache and how they are removed. 

We’ll spend time exploring the key differences between actual and estimated plans, and why those descriptions are more than a little misleading. We’ll also show you assorted methods to obtain a query's execution plan and what the differences and tradeoffs of each are.

We'll look at where to find useful information in execution plans, what the common operators are and how to decipher the sometimes cryptic messages the plans are sending to you. We'll also debunk some myths surrounding query operators and execution plans, and we'll show how you can use the execution plan to identify performance issues and other query problems.
