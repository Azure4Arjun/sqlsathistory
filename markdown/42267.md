## Title: Turning Requirements into a BI Prototype
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Server system can support two types of Analysis Services models: multidimensional or tabular. But what if you’ve never implemented them and your company wants to start using BI? Are you wondering how to get started? Regardless of which type of SSAS model you want to use, the best first step is to determine what types of questions your BI solution should answer. Next, determine how to structure your data. Before you begin the physical restructuring of your data, though, you should validate your proposed design by creating a prototype that users can review with you. In this session you’ll learn how to translate the business questions to be answered by your solution into a functional prototype that can steer your development efforts in the right direction.
