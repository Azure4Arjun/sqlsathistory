#### [Back to calendar](#nr-192)
Event Date: 02-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 8
## Speaker: Bradley Ball
## Title: SQL Internals , Recovery Models, and Backups! OH M
## Abstract:
### The more you know about SQL Server the more you understand how it works.  SQL Server is a product we use every day, and most of us know the big concepts.  At the 10,000 foot view we know what  Databases, Tables, and Columns are.   But what makes up those Databases, Tables, and Columns.  What are Records, Pages, Extents, and Allocation Units?  What are Full, Simple, and Bulk-Logged Recovery?  What are the differences between  Full, Transaction Log, Differential, or Filegroup backups?  What is a Peicemeal Restore?  This is an introduction to these concepts using SQL 2012.  In this session you will learn about the internal Structure, Recovery Models, and Backups and be better prepared to for Future Learning and Managing SQL!

## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Top Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance
## Abstract:
### This session will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you the top 10 Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.

# Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-192)
Event Date: 02-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Brian Flynn
## Title: Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers? After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels. This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel. No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools. You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started. Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.

# Partitioning for Perf and Management
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-192)
Event Date: 02-03-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 6
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Management
## Abstract:
### Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Using PowerShell To Document Your SQL Envronment
## Abstract:
### We've all been here before: 
- You're the DBA and it seems like every day someone is telling you about some other server you never knew existed but you're responsible for 
- You're the consultant and you want to know what SQL Servers your new client has but they can't tell you 
- You're the IT Manager and your CTO asks you for an inventory of every SQL Server running in production 

How do you go about figuring out where the SQL Servers are, how they're set up, and what they're doing? 

This session will give you the answer by demonstrating how to use PowerShell and SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) to discover and document all of your instances - no PowerShell experience required!

## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Hello, My Name is DAX
## Abstract:
### For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without development access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.  We will even show how to use DAX expressions to create new measures.

## Title: Sysadmin not always required...
## Abstract:
### I'll describe how I've used the Separation of Duties Framework and a Privileged Identity Management suite to minimize the permissions needed by DBAs to do routine work.  I'll review the Separation of Duties Framework and the process I took to arrive at a workable solution that will give DBAs the access they need to maintain the server but not be able to view user data.
