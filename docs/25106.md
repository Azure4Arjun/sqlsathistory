## Title: Scaling Analysis Services in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Over the last years Analysis Services has proven its scalability with big data volumes and also with many users. Those high-end solutions are usually very strongly tied to the hardware they are running on. When moving those solutions to the cloud we need to reconsider this whole setup as a single on-premise hardware still outperforms a cloud machine by far. In order to achieve the same overall performance we need to scale out our Analysis Services instances across multiple hosts in the cloud and that's what this session is about.
