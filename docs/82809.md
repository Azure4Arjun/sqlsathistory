## Title: SQL Server Containers in Azure
## Abstract:
### Running SQL Server in Docker containers brings benefits that data professionals shouldn't be ignoring. Over the last year the images provided by Microsoft have matured to a point where running SQL Server containers in production is a viable option.

However, running standalone Docker containers presents challenges so other technologies are need to support them. This session will provide an introduction to the various options for running SQL Server containers in Azure.

I'll cover the following different topics:-
The Azure Container Registry
Azure Container Instances
Azure Container Services

This session is aimed at SQL Server DBAs and Developers who have some experience with Docker and want to know the different options that are available in Azure.

Each topic will be backed up with demos which will show how simple it is to get up and running with these technologies
