## Title: Why SSRS/SharePoint Integration Is Worth The Pain
## Abstract:
### Reporting Services standardizes your report creation and SharePoint enables collaboration and content management. SSRS/SharePoint Integrated Mode gives you a platform to empower your developers, power users, and end users. We will discuss the initial setup of integrated mode, work through some real life strategies using simple out of the box features, and consider some places where more development and planning may be helpful.
