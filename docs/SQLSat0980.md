# Implement a disaster recovery solution for your on-prem SQL with Azure? Easy!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#980-–-Plovdiv-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Marco Obinu
## Title: Implement a disaster recovery solution for your on-prem SQL with Azure? Easy!
## Abstract:
### Thanks to Azure cloud, today it's possible to design Disaster Recovery solutions that are easy to implement and affordable also for small and medium-sized companies.
From a SQL Server perspective, we can leverage on different technologies to manage cross-premises scenarios, where Always On Availability Groups technology represents the key feature to design a flexible solution that can be easily integrated with Azure Site Recovery.
Let's see together what choices we have, with a particular focus on Availability Groups and their implementation in a hybrid scenario.

### This presentation is about how to create custom visuals (components) for your PowerBI reports. Power BI reporting features could be extended with custom components, that developers can implement and BI specialist can include in their dashboards. Many visuals are also availabe in the Power BI Visuals Gallery.

Power BI is flexible with which graphical API you prefer to use, but their open source project is all D3.

D3.js is a JavaScript library of objects to produce sophisticated, interactive, dynamic data visualizations using modern web-based technologies

In this talk you will learn how to:

- Set up the dev environment (using PowerBI visuals CLI tool)
- Build your visuals
- Debug your Power BI components
- Use custom visuals in your dashboards
- Publish visuals to Power BI Visuals Gallery
- Road-map of Power BI Visuals API

# Azure Logic Apps – how to integrate different systems with zero coding?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#980-–-Plovdiv-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Anton Boyko
## Title: Azure Logic Apps – how to integrate different systems with zero coding?
## Abstract:
### We would love to have "one ring to rule them all", but, unfortunately, life is a very cruel place and I am yet to find a company that is able to use only one system to manage all their business flows. To manage a dozen of different systems it will be just reasonable to have a single point of integration, an integration bus if you prefer. And that's the point where Azure Logic Apps comes very handy. With hundreds, if not thousands, of different connectors to different systems I can easily receive a new order from Sales Force, check that I have required items in stock against my SQL database, post the data to SAP ERP and send an email to a client that his order is on the way. Making those things happen will require no coding whatsoever. I will not be forced to go deep diving into different system APIs and become an expert in everything. Minimum efforts and maximum value.

# Self-Service ETL: The PowerBI Data Flows
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#980-–-Plovdiv-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Dennes Torres
## Title: Self-Service ETL: The PowerBI Data Flows
## Abstract:
### What was already good has became even better. We were already able to make ETL in PowerBI using M, now, using the PoweBI Data Flows we are able to store the ETL on the PowerBI Portal, control the ETL execution, the data among many ETL steps and share the result with many Power BI files, instead of having to duplicate M scripts accross different .PBIX files

In this session you will understand better what Data Flows can bring to our already powerful self-service BI tools

## Speaker: Marco Dal Pino
## Title: Azure SQL Database EDGE, put your SQL wherever you want!
## Abstract:
### Developing application for Smart city, Sensors, Industrial IoT increasingly need more affordable and powerful way to store data and manage it. 
Now we can also use the same approach we have in our client server distributed application even in remote deployed devices frquently not connected to internet.
Expand device architecture coverage to include ARM-based devices on top of x64-based architecture. Use Kubernetes to orchestrate your device infrastructure for better efficiency and automation. Run SQL Database Edge connected or offline to support various edge environments.

# Why my query is slow and how to make it fast
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#980-–-Plovdiv-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Denis Reznik
## Title: Why my query is slow and how to make it fast
## Abstract:
### Generally, there are only two options for query slowness: either the query itself is slow (high CPU time), or the query is waiting for some resource (high Wait time) - all other reasons for query slowness derive from these two options. Well, I have to admit it is not that easy, there are a lot of things which can slow down the query, and the slowness root cause is among them. In this session, I will show you the approach which I use for query performance tuning. We will look through the bunch of queries, their query plans, execution statistics, DMV's and extended events to identify the slowness root cause and optimize the queries.

# Quantum computing explained with demos!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#980-–-Plovdiv-–-Virtual-2020)
Event Date: 12-12-2020 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Damian Widera
## Title: Quantum computing explained with demos!
## Abstract:
### This talk is inspired by the quantum revolution we will see in a moment.
I would like to introduce the topics:
- reminder why basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors) is important
- qbits, superposition, and quantum logic gates
- Show the simplest problem where a quantum computer outperforms classical methods

If time permits - quantum entanglement

I will do demos implemented in Q# with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.

I do not assume any special knowledge, but if you know basic linear algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication) than the topic will be more easily understand!

### It seems like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are a must nowdays.
For projects carrying a simple or well kown problem we can find a lot of ready-made solutions, but this extremne easy to use could be one of our best enemy when facing with specific custom problems.
With this session we will cover how to apply best practices in configurin ML but much more, do we reaaly need it always?
The second part will cover vulnerabilities of ML discovering how easy could be to fool a neural network by some techinques (Like pixel attack) and their implication in projects that requires no security issues.
