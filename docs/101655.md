## Title: Load a Data Warehouse using SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will discuss various components available in SSIS to help load a data warehouse, including the data load of dimension and fact tables. We will discuss what to watch for when using the Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) component, and how you may load into fact tables incrementally on large-scale implementations. As we progress, we will demonstrate some best practices that can be used to achieve the desired performance with great flexibility when loading a data warehouse.
