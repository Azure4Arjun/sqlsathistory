## Title: Azure SQL DB Managed Instance: Today
## Abstract:
### It has been about a year since Azure SQL DB Managed Instance has been released. What is it? Where does it fit? What limitations does it have? What has changed? What changes should I see next?  These questions will be addressed and more.  Will we see Managed Instance in action? We can, but it is just SQL Server presented in a different wrapper.  Along with Managed Instance, a discussion of Serverless and Hyperscale options will also be included.
