## Title: Reducing the impact of database changes on an app
## Abstract:
### The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far. My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.
