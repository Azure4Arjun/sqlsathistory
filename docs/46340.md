## Title: Strategic Decision Making and Problem Solving
## Abstract:
### The key to finding creative solutions is not just creativity, although that will certainly help. The answer rests in our ability to identify options, research them, and then put things together in a way that works. Having a process to work through can take the anxiety out of problem solving and make decisions easier. Thatâ€™s what this session is all about. Participants will learn how to: Apply problem solving steps and tools/Analyze information to clearly describe problems/Identify appropriate solutions/ Think creatively and be a contributing member of a problem solving team/ Select the best approach for making decisions/ Create a plan for implementing, evaluating, and following up on decisions/ Avoid common decision-making mistakes
