# SQL 2012 Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2 - Adv.DBA
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: SQL 2012 Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2012, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into what extended events are.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.

Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2 - Adv.DBA
## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

# Advanced Performance Tuning Tips with Database Performance Analyzer (formerly Confio Ignite) 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2 - Adv.DBA
## Speaker: Carlos Parra
## Title: Advanced Performance Tuning Tips with Database Performance Analyzer (formerly Confio Ignite) 
## Abstract:
### SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path.

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Optimizing Protected Indexes
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

# Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3 - BI
## Speaker: Dave Fackler
## Title: Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduced columnstore indexing but with one major drawback -- columnstore indexes were not updateable.  Thus, adopting them to improve data warehousing (or other) query patterns took careful planning and quite a bit of management.  SQL Server 2014 introduces clustered columnstore indexes that are now fully updateable!  During this session, we'll take a look at how clustered columnstore indexes work, what implications exist for using them, and how the update process is handled.  We'll also take a look at what management and maintenance operations are required to keep clustered columnstore indexes performing optimally.  Anyone with a large data warehouse environment (or even an OLTP or ODS database with very large tables) will definitely want to attend!

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4 - Dev
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

# How to Write a DML Trigger
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1 - DBA
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Write a DML Trigger
## Abstract:
### Triggers are extremely powerful and useful (if somewhat rarely needed) objects that are coded very similar to a common stored procedure. Yet for their similarity, there are some very important differences that need to be understood. In this session, I will walk through what goes into writing a robust DML trigger, starting with a simple version of a trigger, and working through some very useful applications of DML Triggers..

Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1 - DBA
## Speaker: Ed Watson
## Title: "So you have a performance issue.  What now?"
## Abstract:
### You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".

# Best Practices for Database Deployment
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-286)
Event Date: 21-06-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1 - DBA
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Best Practices for Database Deployment
## Abstract:
### The easiest part of any deployment is running the deployment script on production. But what have you done to prepare that script for production? Was the script tested? Is the script tightly coupled with the application code? The difference between a successful deployment and a failed or problematic deployment is all the preparation work you've done to ensure that you're deploying the right script, the right way to your production environment. This session will explore best practices that you can implement to ensure that your deployments are as successful as they can be.

## Speaker: Mickey Stuewe
## Title: Best Practices for Efficient SSRS Report Creation
## Abstract:
### You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn't it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you'll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don't stop changing once they're released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.

## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: Crazy Things That Developers Do
## Abstract:
### Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.
