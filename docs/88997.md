## Title: Lost in the wealth of database products? We will help you to make sense of them.
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time there was Oracle. Few years later DB2 and Sybase were born. Sybase gave birth to SQL Server. The world was nice and simple. But ~10 years ago all hell broke loose.
SQL, NoSQL and NewSQL; In-memory and Disk-based; Cloud and On-premises; Key-value store, Document store, Graph, Column store and Timeseries; Enterprise and Community;
We will make sense of those buzzwords, review the most popular database technologies - when they are a good fit and when they aren't and analyse typical use-cases and architectures. Last but not least - we will review few less popular technologies that are worth consideration and adoption.
