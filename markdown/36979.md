## Title: Optimising Cube Processing
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what actually happens when a cube is “processed”, why it takes so long, how you can configure and optimise cube
 processing, or what strategies people commonly use for improving processing?

 This session provides a deep dive into cube processing
 for MOLAP, to help understand how it works and what you can
 do to work with it.

 Come to this session for a better understanding of how
 to configure, optimise and tune cube processing.

 Included in the session is case studies from our performance
 lab and some sample tools to analyse processing logs.
