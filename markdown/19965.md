## Title: Virtualizing SQL Server w/out Sacrificing Performa
## Abstract:
### Everyone has heard the benefits of virtualization touted: nimble infrastructures, on-demand provisioning, and savings in cap-ex and op-ex due to service consolidation.  Most organizations have deployed some form of virtual infrastructure, in most cases resembling what folks would call a private cloud.

Getting to the next step often involves migrating more demanding, more critical services.
