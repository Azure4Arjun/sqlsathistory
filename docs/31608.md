## Title: SSIS Performance Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Need a fast data integration solution, but don't have the time or budget for heavy performance tuning? Come learn how to maximize your ROI by applying trusted design patterns to your Integration Services packages. We’ll start off by looking at how to set performance expectations, and see how you can easily put together a simple framework to record benchmarks for your ETL process. We’ll then dive into a number of common design patterns, such as surrogate key generation, advanced Lookup patterns, parallel processing, change data capture, and different ways of handling slowly changing dimensions .
