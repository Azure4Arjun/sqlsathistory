# Understanding Indexes in SQL Server 2008
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#71---Boston-2011)
Event Date: 02-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Data Development
## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: Understanding Indexes in SQL Server 2008
## Abstract:
### Understanding the fundamentals of how indexes work and how they are best utilized is an essential part of any DBA or SQL developer’s repertoire.  Many people assume if you create an index on a column or columns of a table that it will automatically be used when you reference that column. While that may be true under some conditions the actual usage depends on several key factors and they may surprise you. We will cover the fundamentals of how the indexes work under the covers and why you need to know this in order to ensure your indexes are actually helping and not hurting your performance.

## Speaker: 
## Title: Axis Technology: Data Masking
## Abstract:
### Data Masking is the act of replacing sensitive data with fictitious but realistic data in order to eliminate the risk of exposure to unauthorized parties.     Implementing a sustainable data masking program in a modern enterprise environment can be surprisingly challenging—not just technically and organizationally, but culturally.     The reactions and concerns you’ll encounter from your development and QA teams are understandable. You’re not just introducing new controls over confidentiality exposures in development and testing systems. You’re shutting off developers’ and testers’ unfettered access to live customer Production data—something that’s been quite normal and convenient for them to date, something they think they just can’t do th

# Creating a Metadata Mart wi/SSIS - Data Governance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#71---Boston-2011)
Event Date: 02-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS/ETL
## Speaker: Ira Warren
## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart wi/SSIS - Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Consolidation and Virtualization: A Success Story
## Abstract:
### Consolidating SQL Server Instances can be daunting. Virtualizing SQL Server instances can be intimidating. Doing both at the same time can be absolutely frightening. 

When Mike Hillwig inherited his SQL environment, he had 14 SQL Server instances, running five different versions of SQL, all using local disk. In one project, his team consolidated this down to four servers. And the entire environment is virtual. In this session, MIke will share what they did, how they did it, what worked, and what didn't work so well.

## Abstract:
### You've always wanted to get promoted into the DBA position. The good news is you got it - the bad news is you have no idea what to do first. What's important, what's not a big deal, and what can get you fired if you're not careful? If your answer wasn’t, “update my resume”, then this session is a good start. We’ll chat about a natural priority for the overwhelming flood waiting in our offices. By focusing on a few words ending in “ity” we’ll realize what is most important. Through the interaction, stories and examples you’ll leave feeling ready to attack your environment. Be warned – along the way to knowing where to start, you may get that feeling in your stomach that makes you log on to the VPN to check a few things out.

## Speaker: Paul White
## Title: SQL Query Optimization - It's Not Rocket Science!
## Abstract:
### Writing a query optimizer that produces a great execution plan for every SQL query, on every database, with every hardware configuration, is a hard problem. A really hard problem. Luckily, few of us will be called upon to write an optimizer. On the other hand, most of us have to make use of the SQL Server query optimizer in our everyday work. To write queries that will optimize well, it helps to have a good understanding of how the optimizer translates T-SQL code into an executable plan and how to read those plans. Come to this session and learn how to take full advantage of the optimizer's powerful features, how to avoid some of its limitations, and how to leverage the wealth of information contained in SQL Server's execution plans.

## Speaker: Steve Simon
## Title: Database Design for mere developers
## Abstract:
### Efficient and effective database design is so important that  leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.
In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns",  final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

## Title: Introduction to MDX
## Abstract:
### If you want to get the most out of your Analysis Services cube it’s essential to know and understand MDX: you need to be able to write MDX queries and calculations. MDX is part of the underlying foundation for the SSAS (OLAP architecture), and it offers detailed and efficient navigation and drill across of multidimensional data. MDX is designed to ease the process of accessing data from multiple dimensions
This session aimed at those with little or no previous MDX experience will teach you the basic concepts of the language as well as show you how to write common queries and calculations.
