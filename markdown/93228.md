## Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together
## Abstract:
### Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.
