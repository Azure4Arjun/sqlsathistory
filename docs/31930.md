## Title: “Managed Self-Service BI” and “Data As A Service”
## Abstract:
### You know BI.  Right?  Well kids, traditional Business Intelligence is changing … you heard about the ambitious data analyst down the hall who created a mashup of data from the internal data warehouse + Excel + an Azure feed?  Empowering knowledge workers is Microsoft's vision of delivering "BI for the Masses."  In this session we will dismiss the hype  examine how this new world of "Managed Self-Service BI" complements Corporate BI in SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint 2010.  Goals: (1) Overview of each Self-Service component.  (2) Introduce Codename "Data Explorer" and Data As A Service.  (3) Techniques to monitor, manage,  secure the Self-Service BI environment.
