## Title: My SQL Server is Not Slow for Pete's Sake! - Server Side Performance Analysis 
## Abstract:
### You got the "It's Slow" call, yeah you know the one.  There are many places to dig in and determine how true that is but we'll focus on what the server thinks utilizing Performance Monitor.  We'll go a bit deep into those facts in the poster on the wall and tell you the what/where/whys of it all.  We'll make sure you understand those items selected and what they mean.  We will also go through ways to quickly analyze that mountain of data collected.
