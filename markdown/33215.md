## Title: Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it.  With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as a temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query.  Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's.  One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which no only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  This presentation is targeted for database programmers and administrators who are familiar with TRANSACT SQL, Subqueries, and advanced join techniques.
