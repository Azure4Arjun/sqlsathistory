## Title: Data Warehouse ETL Rollback with SSIS 2012
## Abstract:
### Loading a data warehouse can be fraught with data quality issues, data type mismatches, and failed loads. To combat these issues and load your data quickly can be a challenge.  This session will explain step-by-step how to implement an ETL rollback framework to remove any data that was loaded incorrectly.  Based on a real-world implementation, this framework can either automatically or manually load the corrected data, making your life easier.
