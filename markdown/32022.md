## Title: Work/Life Balance?  Just A Myth?
## Abstract:
### Many of us started our IT careers in the exact same way: 80-hour work weeks, routine overnight gigs, no life outside the office—this was simply what we considered “normal.” Today, with our careers underway, how do we build a life outside of our IT world? We will share the tips, tricks and tools we’ve discovered and used to create a work/life balance that allows us to feel fulfilled and refreshed outside the office while maintaining our effectiveness as successful data professionals.
