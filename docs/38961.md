## Title: What's New for SQL Developers in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Next version of SQL Server is just "around the corner". In this session we will look at what a SQL Server developer may find interesting among a "sea" of new features / functionality.

Things we will look at is:  improvements to In-Memory OLTP (the "artist" formerly known as Hekaton),  Operational Analysis - how to combine OLTP processes together with the ability to analyse the data at the same time, new JSON support and other odd and "sundry" things
