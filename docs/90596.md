## Title: Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!
## Abstract:
### Always Encrypted was introduced in SQL Server 2016, and it was a big step forward for encryption - but it had a very long list of exclusions which prevented it from being adopted by many organizations. Now, with SQL Server 2019, Always Encrypted is getting some much-needed improvements to its functionality. By utilizing the secure enclave capabilities of Windows 2019, SQL Server adds some impressive new abilities to work with data while it is encrypted. In this session, weâ€™ll explore the secure enclave, and we'll see how you can leverage the new capabilities of Always Encrypted in your environment.
