## Title: Databases on mobile devices
## Abstract:
### You are a Windows Phone developer or just a mobile developer and you need a database locally, on the device, a database, what are your options? And really how do you sync you data with the big database? What you can do, what you cannot do, and how? How cloud is changing this story?  These are a few of the questions this presentation will try to answer, the focus be on Windows Phone (the easiest to demo, but not ignoring the “others”). The actual industrial devices will be also covered. 
And of course all with as much demoes and code as possible.
