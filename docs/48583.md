## Title: Mastering queries into XML data.
## Abstract:
### If you've never queried an XML column you definitely want to attend.  While targeted to beginners this isn't a "Just do this" session.  After this session I'd like you to truly understand even subtle nuances of basic query syntax.  Seasoned veterans stand a fair chance of learning something new.
