## Title: Integrating Hadoop data into Azure SQL Server PaaS - Lessons Learned
## Abstract:
### Is integrating Hadoop data into an Azure SQL Server PaaS environment for BI reporting on your to-do list? Join us for data architecture lessons learned while migrating Apache Kudu data into an Azure SQL PaaS environment for a client new to the Azure cloud.  We will address getting to know your data, the importance of designing an indexing strategy up front, helpful data pre-processing optimizations, ELT vs. ETL, the importance of managing Querystore and statistics purging, a couple of methods for capturing real-time query performance.  Helpful links and Azure PaaS metadata queries will be provided.
