## Title: What I learned about functional programming in C# while using JavaScript
## Abstract:
### Programming in C# is about decomposing code into classes, but is it possible to achieve encapsulation and modularity using only lambdas? Apart from being an interesting excursion into functional features of the C#, this talk will illustrate how modularity can be achieved in languages such as JavaScript that emphasize functions over classes.

A basic understanding of Func and dynamic is necessary. Most of the talk will be coding in C#, with a few snippets of JavaScript.
