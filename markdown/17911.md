## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: $#*! Your Database Says About Me
## Abstract:
### Does your data sit around mocking your best attempts to support good data practices?  Databases are also bound by the GIGO rule: Garbage In is Garbage Out.  In this presentation, Karen shows you examples of the types of mistakes, misunderstandings and outright cheats that lead to poor data quality, mistrust in IT systems and overall smelliness in our IT solutions-- using real-life evidence of her own data in your systems.
