## Speaker: Ryan Adams
## Title: How Active Directory affects SQL Server BI
## Abstract:
### There are many things that can go wrong with SQL server, and a lot of times they come from outside influencers.  Whether you're using SSRS, SSIS, or SSAS, Active Directory is one of the largest influencers.  We'll discuss how the location of your server in AD is important, how security can be compromised, AD DNS configuration, and of course Kerberos.  By the end of the session you'll have a check list of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work.  This includes the biggest perpetrator, Group Policy Objects.
