## Title: Query Processing improvements in the latest versions of SQL Server – IT
## Abstract:
### How many times have you faced bad performances caused by incorrect rows-estimation or caused by multi-statement user-defined table valued functions? Have you ever seen a warning on Sort operator that spills data on tempdb caused by inadequate memory estimation? These are not the only problems we could have with queries optimization, but these are the three problems that SQL Server 2017 Adaptive Query Processing attempts to address. SQL Server 2019 introduces additional features and all of them are known with the name Intelligent Query Processing. This session will cover the Adaptive Query Processing first. Next we will cover, briefly, the features implemented in SQL Server 2019.
