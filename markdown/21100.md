## Speaker: Michael Reed
## Title: From Query to Disk: Managing your queries, data distribution, and environment for best performance
## Abstract:
### The 'out of the box' SQL Server installation and configuration is generally useless in an enterprise of any size and will lead to unbelievably poor query performance. In this hour we will discuss the basics of SQL Server deployment and configuration, the tools at your disposal to optimize query execution, and some tricks to make your queries perform at their best...all from the 'magic wand' approach where we start with 'most optimal' then adjust as necessary to suit the circumstances. Expect to learn a little bit of everything...from SQL Server deployment and configuration to indexing and statistics to stored procedures and functions to query design to database architecture.
