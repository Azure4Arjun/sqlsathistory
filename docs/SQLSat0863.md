# Utilizing Azure DevOps on a BI Project
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Build
## Speaker: Liz Barrett
## Title: Utilizing Azure DevOps on a BI Project
## Abstract:
### DevOps has historically been a term associated with software engineering, but did you know it can have a number of benefits in the BI space? Using Azure DevOps, code changes and ETL pipelines can be managed and deployed in a partially or fully automated, repeatable process. In doing so, bugs and integration issues can be detected and resolved early, while also saving time in doing manual migrations.

In this session, we will explore the intersect between Azure DevOps and BI, the tools needed to implement, and a real-life example of how it all works together.

## Speaker: Jamie Wick
## Title: SQL Restore: Optimizing Your Data Recovery
## Abstract:
### When disaster strikes, everyone’s immediate question becomes: How long until the system is back online? Whether it’s a single database or the whole SQL environment, time is essential… As everyone waits for the restore to complete. 

How long will the restoration process take? 
Can it run faster? 

In this session, we’ll answer these questions by looking at the Disaster Recovery process and the options available for performance tuning database restores.

# Dodo - Using PowerShell to Deploy TSQL to Multiple Servers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Build
## Speaker: Jeff Nowiski
## Title: Dodo - Using PowerShell to Deploy TSQL to Multiple Servers
## Abstract:
### Do you have multiple servers in your environment?  
Do you have have multiple databases that share the same schema on the same instance (sharding)?
Do you wish you had a simple way to run a TSQL script against an instance without having to use SSMS?
Do you tire of other people forgetting to deploy to one of your servers?
Do you wish you had a way to communicate when someone deployed code to an instance?
Do you enjoy ASCII art?
Are you lazy?

If you answered yes to any of the above and wish you had an easier way to "Right click file(s)" and just deploy them to instance(s), I think I might have the solution for you.  This is a free and open source PowerShell based solution that you are welcome to use.  It can rely on a CMS (Central Management Server) or CSV file for server list.  

This doesn't solve the need for a proper release process or CI Automation but sometimes you just need to do things manually.

# Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Innovate
## Speaker: Shannon Lowder
## Title: Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!
## Abstract:
### Automating extract packages is trivial., you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!

## Speaker: John Welch
## Title: Automating the Data-Centric Deployment Pipeline
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment are common elements of modern DevOps practices. However, it’s rare to see these practices put into place for data-centric applications, like databases, ETL, data warehouses, or reports. In this session, we’ll cover why these approaches are beneficial for the data organization and the pieces you need to have in place to be successful. We’ll also cover some of the prime trouble spots that organizations run into, as well as some tools that can help jump start your efforts.

# Encrypting Data within Sql Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Design
## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Encrypting Data within Sql Server
## Abstract:
### Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep off of the data breach list? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. The session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share my experiences implementing the encryption. In addition, the session will review auditing of sensitive data usage.  

You will leave the session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  In addition, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.

# Index Trek: An Introduction to Nonclustered, Clustered, and Columnstore Indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Perform
## Speaker: Sandra Peele
## Title: Index Trek: An Introduction to Nonclustered, Clustered, and Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### When learning something new, it’s helpful to have a foundation.  Yet, indexes are often taught with only one or two sentences of explanation before CREATE INDEX.  I recall a student, exasperated by the textbook definition saying, “Will someone just SHOW ME an index!”  The goal of this high level presentation is to do just that.  In this 60 minute mission, we’ll explore nonclustered and clustered indexes as well as the strange new world of columnstore indexes.  Rather than focus on space and time requirements of indexes and index maintenance, we’ll seek out new understanding:

•	Why well-designed indexes speed up queries.
•	Why queries must be engineered carefully to use indexes.
•	Why indexes have both benefits and drawbacks.

After the mission, you’ll be prepared to further explore the galaxy of indexes.

# Migrate Your Database with Distributed AGs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Build
## Speaker: Elizabeth Noble
## Title: Migrate Your Database with Distributed AGs
## Abstract:
### You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will explain the purpose and usages of Distributed AGs, create a Distributed AG and the associated AGs, and perform a mock data center migration.

# Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Support
## Speaker: Jeff Mlakar
## Title: Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!

## Speaker: Ryan Adams
## Title: TempDB Inside Out
## Abstract:
### Either you are experiencing TempDB contention or you are not sure and want to find out.  This pain is something every DBA has experienced or will experience, but it's not easy to figure out how to set it up correctly.  You will learn how to identify if TempDB is having contention, what causes it to happen, where it can come from, and how to fix it.  We will discuss the required trace flags and when to use them as I demo the behavior.  You will walk away with the scripts and knowledge of how to configure TempDB per best practice.

## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: SSMS Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### Almost everyone uses SSMS to write queries and to browse around on the server - but do you use all of the features that SSMS offers to increase your productivity? Most people use few of these, and probably don't even know that many of these features even exist. Come to this session, consisting almost entirely of demos in SSMS, to see features built in to SSMS that will improve your experience and productivity. Time permitting; we'll also go into some 3rd party products that also increase your productivity in SSMS.

# CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Vendor Session
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Vendor Session
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Sponsored - Maximum SQL Server on VMware Performance
## Abstract:
### Your business-critical SQL Servers should not suffer from virtualization-related bottlenecks. When properly architected and managed, the principal bottleneck to performance of these SQL Servers should be only limited by code. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. Layers like virtualization can detract from database performance if not managed correctly, and they are tough to identify.

This session is packed with many live examples of tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Speaker: Jerod Johnson
## Title: SQL Access to SaaS/Cloud Data through PolyBase and Linked Servers
## Abstract:
### Data virtualization technologies enable modern organizations to operate across disparate data sets without the need to consolidate data storage through warehousing and ETL processes. Technologies like PolyBase and SQL Server Linked Servers bring this capability to SQL Server, enabling users to query external data like any other table in SQL Server. 
 
In this talk, we will discuss the virtualization features of SQL Server 2019 PolyBase and the distributed querying enabled by SQL Linked Servers and examine how we can issue Transact-SQL queries that connect data across SQL Server and SaaS/Cloud or NoSQL data sources.

# Your AG might not be as “Available” as you think
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#863---Raleigh-2019)
Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Design
## Speaker: Joseph Fleming
## Title: Your AG might not be as “Available” as you think
## Abstract:
### You’ve got an availability group! Good for you! It’s set up all nice and shiny with all the settings configured just right for maximum availability, and the dashboard says “Synchronized.” But wait, did you know someone added a new job to your primary server last week but didn’t add it to your secondary? Or what about the new linked server that was added on your readable secondary to aid with the reports accounting was asking for…did anyone add it to the primary?

An availability group will keep all of your database objects synchronized, but server-level objects are often overlooked. In this session I’ll show you how to set up a reporting tool that will show you which objects are out of sync so that you can correct them, including a query that will let you compare both objects so you can see what’s different.

## Speaker: Tracy Boggiano
## Title: Using Open Source Products to Collect Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we’ll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize in an interactive way and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issue

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Support
## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: Intelligent Query Processing
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has evolved many times over the years. SQL Server 2019 introduces “Intelligent Query Processing”, greatly enhancing the “Adaptive Query Processing” which was introduced in SQL Server 2017. Intelligent Query Processing allows your queries to operate more efficiently (resulting in better query performance) – without needing to make changes to the code or the application.

In this session we will explore all the Intelligent Query Processing features in SQL Server 2019. Time permitting, we will go into other changes in recent versions of SQL Server (such as execution plan changes and new Dynamic Management Objects) that will help improve your efficiency at troubleshooting and tuning SQL Server.

Coming away from this session, you will have plenty of reasons to want to upgrade to SQL Server 2019 immediately!

# Module Signing: Certificates Replace TRUSTWORTHY / EXECUTE AS / DB Chaining

## Speaker: Solomon Rutzky
## Title: Module Signing: Certificates Replace TRUSTWORTHY / EXECUTE AS / DB Chaining
## Abstract:
### We often need to grant a higher-than-ideal level of permissions to a Login / Role so that someone can: start a SQL Agent job (but you don't want them to edit anything), get data from a DMV that requires "VIEW SERVER STATE" permission (but that permission gives access to too much data), query across databases, etc. These problems are usually solved with a combination of: EXECUTE AS (i.e. Impersonation), cross-DB ownership chaining, or TRUSTWORTHY ON. Unfortunately, those options are all security risks.

Module Signing — https://ModuleSigning.info/ — is more flexible and secure, but requires a Certificate or Asymmetric Key. Those can be confusing to work with, and the security mechanism isn't intuitive. However, that confusion ends here.

Come learn how to have more secure, granular permissions that handle cross-DB tasks, Dynamic SQL, and SQLCLR. See what signing can do, how certificates and asymmetric keys work, and realize it's not as hard as you thought.

## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
## Abstract:
### No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.

## Speaker: Azhagappan Arunachalam
## Title: SQL Graph
## Abstract:
### Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017 (and 2019), and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft's offering).  Microsoft added SQL Graph features to their 2017 release, and has added support for MERGE (UPSERT) scenarios to ease insertions into edge tables, and Edge Constraints to apply restrictions on relationships between nodes in 2019 release (in CTP 2.0).  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.

# I/O Tuning 101

Event Date: 27-04-2019 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Scale
## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: I/O Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Title: Welcome to DAX
## Abstract:
### "Welcome to DAX" is an introductory session inviting you to the world of Data Analysis eXPressions (DAX), Microsoft's new native formula and query language found in Power BI, SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular and the Power Pivot plug-in for Excel. DAX, initially released in 2009 with the first version of Power Pivot, opened a brave, new world for analysts and developers to quickly build formulas and calculations to analyze and mold data of all shapes and sizes. DAX is designed to be simple and easy to learn while exposing the power and flexibility of Tabular modeling. But be warned, looks can be deceiving. In this session, we'll navigate the basics of DAX to understand best practices around syntax and usage. Along the way we will discover the intricacies of how row, query and filter context affect output in a DAX expression and how we can manipulate that context to get the results we need.
