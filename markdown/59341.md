# SQLSaturday #620 - Dublin 2017
Event Date: 17-06-2017 - Session time: 11:45:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: Investigate TempDB like Sherlock Holmes
## Abstract:
### The system database TempDB has often been called a dumping ground, even the public toilet of SQL Server. (There has to be a joke about spills in there somewhere). In this session, you will learn to find those criminal activities that are going on deep in the depths of SQL Server that are causing performance issues, not just for one session, but that affects everybody on that instance.

You will leave this session prepared to create better architecture decisions and better code to improve the performance for all of your users.
