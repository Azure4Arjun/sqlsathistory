## Title: Effective Software Application Logging
## Abstract:
### This session presents an overview of effective methods and strategies for capturing and managing useful information about how your software applications are running, what they are doing (which may or may not be what they are expected to be doing), and most importantly, when, where, and sometimes even why, they are malfunctioning. Software application logging is an often neglected, poorly implemented, and under-appreciated aspect of the software development process. But if implemented wisely, logging can be an invaluable tool for debugging, testing, error handling, and auditing. This session will present a case for a more diligent and rewarding approach to logging, and provide useful tips that can cost very little extra development time, but pay off in the long run, most especially when production issues arise and must be resolved quickly.
