## Title: Answering the question, "What happened?" with Query Store
## Abstract:
### One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release is Query Store.  It's been referred to as the "flight recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information, namely plans and runtime statistics.  If you've ever had to drop everything and try to troubleshoot a sudden drop in performance, then you've probably already realized the value of this feature.  In this session we'll explore the Query Store feature using the latest CTP of SQL Server 2016.  We'll review the different options for Query Store, look at examples of what gets collected, dig through the included reports, and see how you can force SQL Server to use a specific plan for a query.
