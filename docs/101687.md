## Title: Eliminating Anti-Patterns and RBAR for Faster Performance
## Abstract:
### Are you looking for faster performance on your existing hardware? Do you have queries that run slowly and don’t seem to scale as the data set grows? Are you running SQL Server in the cloud where you don’t have control over the configuration of the environment? 

This session will show you how to find the low hanging fruit in your environment, explain why the problem exists, and step through how you can make the necessary changes to boost your SQL Server’s performance with a minimal amount of effort. This session focuses on schema and code design problems, to help you get the most bang for your buck when performance tuning SQL Server. By focusing on real-world examples with reproducible workloads, you will easily be able to see the impact of common mistakes and learn how to fix them quickly for improved performance.

This session is the third session in the SQL Performance for Developers Learning Pathway. For more information please visit our Learning Pathways page.
