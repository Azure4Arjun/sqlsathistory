## Title: Identifying and Solving Sort Warning Problems
## Abstract:
### Sometimes SQL Server spills sort operation to tempdb although there is no memory pressure. Why and when it happens and why SQL Server raises a "Sort Warnings" event and what does it mean you can find in this session. We will see how to identify this problem in SQL Server 2008 and more elegant in SQL Server 2012 and of course we can discuss how to prevent this problem.
