## Speaker: Brett Tomson
## Title: Power This, Power That...Making Sense of Power BI
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of Power BI, Microsoft has moved one step closer to its vision of self-service BI for all.  But with this new offering comes a bevy of "Power" apps that are bound to confuse just about anyone.  In this session, we will power through Power BI for Office 365 bringing meaning to the mess of names like Power Query, Power Map, Power Pivot and Power View and how these experiences are delivered through Microsoft Excel and Office 365.  Expect to leave with the power of insight into an exciting new offering that captures the essence of self-service BI.
