## Title: SQL 2012 BI Capabilities in SharePoint 2010 
## Abstract:
### SQL 2012 adds new extensive self-service BI capabilities in SharePoint 2010. The BI Semantic Model is one model for all end user experiences – reporting, analytics, scorecards, dashboards, and custom applications. All client tools in the Microsoft BI stack – Excel, PowerPivot, SharePoint Insights and Reporting Services now operate on this model. PowerPivot in SharePoint 2010 now integrates a Power View SharePoint Integrated Reporting Services instance.
