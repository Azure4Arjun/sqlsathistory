## Title: The "Tally" Table  High Speed "Pseudo Cursors"
## Abstract:
### There are dozens of things we do in T-SQL which require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters", "loops" and recursion to most people. To those well versed in the “Black Arts” of high performance "Set-based" programming, it means a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. This “Developer-to-Developer” session starts with the basics of how SQL Server can be tricked into counting faster than you can imagine, how that simple act of counting replaces slothful loops and other forms of “RBAR”, and provides a substantial introduction to “set based thinking. The session also includes tips on using Pseudo Cursors, CROSS APPLY, and INLINE TABLE VALUED FUNCTIONS (iTVFs) to make your code that much faster .
