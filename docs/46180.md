## Title: Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry
## Abstract:
### Deadlocks present a problem to many DBAs.  Deadlocks can be minor occurrences or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a victim like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand basic locking, blocking of SQL Server.  We will review Isolation Levels, and when is an appropriate time to use each.

We will then review Deadlocking, how to capture Deadlocks and touch on how to resolve Deadlocks and lessen the family fighting.
