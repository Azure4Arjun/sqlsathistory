## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: The Importance of Data Lineage and Assurance Testing
## Abstract:
### With GDPR comes a renewed focus on data security, but do you really know where your data is and how is flows through your systems? Likewise, do you know that it is accurate and that it meets all of the business rules that are associated with it? This is where data lineage and data testing come to the fore.

Join John Martin as he explains what these two concepts are, how they work, and why they are important as well as how SentryOne can help solve these problems.
