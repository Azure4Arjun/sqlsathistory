## Title: The Art of War with Bad Code
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. A typical DBA supports dozens to hundreds or even thousands of end users and processes. There is simply no way to manually determine what code is causing the most performance problems and now you don’t have to. We will see several straightforward techniques to positively identify the main culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. We will show how you can use simplified Extended Event traces and standard TSQL to quickly process the data so you can generate meaningful and actionable reports. The demo code can be integrated immediately into your own environment. Stop running in circles and start identifying the top offenders.
•	Learn how to properly capture the data used to identify the poor performers
•	Learn how to analyze data in order to pinpoint the top offenders
•	Understand how correlate this data to your environment
