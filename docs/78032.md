## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: Database Internals meets PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Understanding and investigating the Internals of an SQL Server database requires use of advanced (often undocumented) DMV's or DBCC commands 

While these provide an insight into the low-level data structures of the database it can be difficult to visualise how these are actually implemented inside the mdf files of the database.

In this session we will see how adding the visualisation options of PowerBI and the Power of R can be used to get a better understanding of how SQL internally manages your data.

Rather than just talking about Fragmentation, Page Splits or Forwarded records, in this session we will show how these physically appear.
