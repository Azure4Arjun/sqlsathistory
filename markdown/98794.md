## Title: Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed
## Abstract:
### Can you use GEOGRAPHY data types to calculate and display celestial phenomena and does it make sense? 
It needs some math and the willingness to use SQL objects for purposes, they havenâ€™t been designed for.
This session is a (hopefully) entertaining exercise to combine scarcely used data types with a bit of astronomy and math to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbines (i.e. moving shadows that may annoy the neighbors) solely by using SQL Management Studio.
Only GEOGRAPHY data type will be used to show the richness and beauty of its functionality. 
 Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handled in SQL.
