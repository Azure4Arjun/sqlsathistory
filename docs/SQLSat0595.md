## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI
## Abstract:
### For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.

## Title: Creating an Azure SQL Database Using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database provides an environment to quickly build SQL Server databases.  This allows for testing of new versions and functionality with minimal effort.  PowerShell provides cmdlets that create, configure and deploy an Azure SQL Database quickly and easily.  Additionally, cmdlets exist to tear the environment down once you are done with it,  Join me to learn more about the options available for scripting and automating the build of an Azure SQL Database.

Event Date: 04-02-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Michael Schulte
## Title: Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the various ways that we can apply advanced analytics by using the R programming language on top of SQL Server. We#39;ll consider the advantages and capabilities of SQL Server R Services and look at how to set up a development environment. Along the way, we will discuss the data science workflow and consider some examples of advanced analytics that are commonly used.

Event Date: 04-02-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jared Karney
## Title: Introduction to Indexes and SARGability
## Abstract:
### Did you know that there is more than one type of index? Do you know the differences between them? Do you know when SQL Server flat out can’t use an index? Join Jared Karney as he explains the differences between the types of indexes and when they can and cannot be used (SARGability). He will talk about the different ways they are used and how you can make good indexes even better. You will leave this session understanding the basics of indexes and how they work, which is crucial to making your queries and servers perform well.

## Speaker: Wendy Pastrick
## Title: Why NULL is not a value (and other SQL gotchas)
## Abstract:
### Allowing NULL "values" in your database is simple, but managing them is a whole different story. Learn what NULL really means and why you may want to avoid it in your systems. I will share techniques for overcoming NULL and other SQL idiosyncrasies leading to bad data or incorrect query results.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-595)
Event Date: 04-02-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

# Demystifying Data Compression
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-595)
Event Date: 04-02-2017 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andy Mallon
## Title: Demystifying Data Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.

## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too
## Abstract:
### We hear it in every session and every webinar “…test…” regardless of it being upgrades, new code, performance tuning or any of a thousand changes.  Once we confirm nothing breaks., we don’t need to check anything else, nothing could possibly change the results, right?  What about load on the database(s) in question or the server as a whole?  In this session four readily available tools, distributed replay, Hammer DB, SQL Query Stress and oStress will be introduced.  The session will cover how to use the tools as well as which situations they shine in.  Once introductions are made, we will spend a little time with two of my favorites, HammerDB and SQL Query Stress.  Join me as we apply a little heat to our SQL Servers.
