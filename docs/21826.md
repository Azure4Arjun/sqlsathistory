## Title: Tabular Models: Easier  Faster Than Cubes; Really? 
## Abstract:
### The future of data analysis is the new, in-memory xVelocity Tabular analytic engine but is this new product ready for enterprise solutions?

Taking off the Microsoft BI marketing hat, let’s take a tabular journey together and learn some lessons from the first generation of real, enterprise-scale solutions: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Beautiful.
