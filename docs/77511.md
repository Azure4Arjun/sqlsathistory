## Title: The Future of the DBA Panel with Lior King  Asaf Aviv
## Abstract:
### In the era of cloud, automation, big data and some other hot buzzwords – what does the future role of the DBA look like? Are we even going to need DBAs in the future? And if we do – are we still going to run maintenance plans? Set up disaster recovery solutions? Implement security best practices? And when is that future anyway? One year from now? Five years? More?
Lior King is going to present the keynote in SQL Saturday Israel 2018, and the topic is “The Future of the DBA”. We are going to grab him right after the keynote, and develop a fascinating discussion with him and with the audience. If you are a DBA today, and you are not sure what you are going to be tomorrow, then this session is for you…
