## Title: The Transaction Log – Beginner's Mind
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered where your data goes before it goes to the data file? Have you ever wanted to save yourself from a mistaken delete or update? Do you want to know what controls recovery, mirroring, log shipping, and availability groups?
Well, welcome to the “The Transaction Log – Beginner's Mind”. In one hour, we will cover everything you will ever need to know to examine, play with, and care for your tlog. You will leave with hours of homework, useful skills for saving your job, and an appreciation of the often overlooked but oh so necessary write-ahead log.
