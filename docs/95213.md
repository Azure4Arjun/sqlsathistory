## Title: From Power BI to AI – Enrich your BI with Artificial Intelligence
## Abstract:
### AI is everywhere – and now even included in Power BI. Sometimes AI might be very apparent when you enrich your data with predictions by explicitly calling an Azure Machine Learning web service in Power Query. Sometimes it might by hidden in a nice little context menu when Power BI is automagically explaining the reason of a difference or a change over time in your data to you.
No matter if you are a business user, analyst or data scientist – Power BI has AI capabilities tailored to you. In this session we will cover how you can integrate and leverage the use of language R, how to integrate an Azure Machine Learning Service when loading data, what kind of insights Power BI is capable of delivering automatically, how you can create a complex new column without typing a single formula/function, how you can explore your data by asking questions in plain English, ... and more!
Sounds like a lot of content? I omitted most of the slides in favour to spend the time in live demos instead.
