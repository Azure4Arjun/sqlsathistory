## Title: Dashboard Development in R
## Abstract:
### Often the first choice for statistics, data analysis, and machine learning, R has a variety of use cases that make it a great fit. And due to the open-source nature of R, there are many packages that make R a great tool for developing dashboards.

In this session, we will discover and understand how to build dashboards in R using a few different patterns. We will also understand how to deliver this content to the consumer in multiple forms, including on-demand (web and bot), interactive (web), and batch (email).

You will leave this session with an understanding of how to start developing dashboards in R and how to deliver them to your user community. To get the most from this session, some general knowledge of R and programming languages is required.
