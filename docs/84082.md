## Speaker: Zane Moreign
## Title: SQL on Linux ¦ Microsoft ♡ Linux … what about (us) Windows folks?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server on Linux - yaaay!   … wait, isn't that a whole new/open world of tech and licensing options?  … and they need the info when? … but I'm already overloaded + the next build of windows is just …  [vent away] …?!

PAUSE:         Windows Server folks went through this a few years ago with the Cloud.  Tex was a guest on TechNet-Edge Radio with John Weston speaking about it, recording on www.HybridDecisions.com  


SPOILER:     You actually become MORE valuable, the more you partake in the Linux world!  (interested?)


CRUX:           Kubernetes + Docker + SQL Server on Linux ~~ PostgreSQL on Linux … if time permits, deploy to Google Cloud and/or Microsoft Azure


AUDIENCE:  Anyone (dev/pro/biz)  interested in the new/open world of SQL Server on Linux (your competition/opportunity?), the newSQL DB options, and possible quick demos
