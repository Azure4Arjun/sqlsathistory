## Speaker: Jens Vestergaard
## Title: ABC's of the Power BI REST API
## Abstract:
### In this session we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. While the Power BI REST API is extensive, we will be limiting this session on the following sections of interest: Dashboards, Datasets, Reports  Groups.
	• How many Dashboards are there in a workspace?
	• Which Datasource is this Dataset configured to use?
	• Who is allowed to see this Report?
	• Can I take ownership of this Dataset?
	• How do I resfresh my Dataset?
	• Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?
	• ...
Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.
Attending this session will make you familiar with the Power BI REST API and provide you with guidance on how to manage the most common tasks in Power BI.
