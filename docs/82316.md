## Title: Tell me a story with Power BI
## Abstract:
### “There are 2 ways to share knowledge. You can push information out or you can pull them in with a story.” – Quote by unknown
Great stories will pull people in, and they will enable you to share ideas, persuade others, and get what you want.
Power BI has some awesome features that take your reports from flat and boring to exciting, interactive applications, enhancing the practical experience and allowing you to tell a great story.
In this session you will see demos of custom visuals, bookmarking, visual display controls, links, spotlights, drillthrough and ‘what if’ plus other tips and tricks that will give you powerful intuitive storytelling capabilities and let you create better insights and organisational performance.
