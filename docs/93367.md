## Title: Azure SQL DW: Optimization Technics to Maximize Performance
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DW is powerful MPP cluster for processing a big amount of structured data. But, it still requires optimization to maximize performance and optimize resource usage. Some technics almost similar to what we do with our regular SQL Server, some of them not due to MPP architecture. In this session, I will cover next topics:
 - how to minimize the time of data loading
 - how to choose a right distribution type
 - data movement minimization
 - how scaling and resource class could help to improve data processing performance
 - maximize Column Store index performance
 - update statistics
 - partitioning strategy
