## Title: Database Decoder Ring
## Abstract:
### I recently took over a new database that I needed to query and report from but I didn't know what was there and how it all connected.  Join me on my journey of tips and tricks to decode your next new database.  There will be some T-SQL, some Interface work and a little bit of Sherlocking while avoiding locking.
