## Title: Data Analysis for the DBA - Performance and Audit Reporting
## Abstract:
### Sometimes you really need to see what your SQL Server is truly capable of doing. You need to find the bottlenecks on performance that could prevent you from adding additional workloads, more users or more databases, whether you are in a virtual or physical environment and regardless of your SQL Server version. But first you have to know what is happening under the hood right now. In this session we will look at how to load test SQL Server while monitoring the important performance metrics and then extrapolate from that data what would happen if you added more users.  We might even cover how to automate this process for other servers. We will also dive into PowerView and SSRS to see how they compare on delivering appealing visualizations of the collected data.
