## Abstract:
### R language has for a long time been the most  popular for data processing and statistical analysis. Among R's strengths are vibrian community and extensive repository of libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. However, major deficiency with R are that is slow, memory-bound and hard to operationalize. 
Microsoft R Server (MRS) mitigate R limitations, and run multi-threaded analysis on a large dataset. The new release, MRS 9, goes even further. 
First off, it contains a Microsoft ML (machine learning) package - a collection of best-of-breed ML algorithms that have been battle-tested by Microsoft on a variety of its products. It includes improved logistic regression, fast boosted decision tree, fast random forest, GPU-accelerated Deep Neural Networks and One-Class Support Vector Machine (for outlisiers detections).
Secondly, MRS 9 allows R models to be exposed as Web services. Furthermore with MRS 9 models that are trained in one environment can even be moved to, and scored in, ot
