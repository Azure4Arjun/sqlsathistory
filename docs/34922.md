## Title: Dive into Querying Analysis Services with MDX
## Abstract:
### This session will put you on the fast track to understanding the fundamentals of MDX and querying your Analysis Services Cubes. MDX is a very powerful tool in your cube development arsenal, but the learning curve can be steep. Together, we will discuss and demonstrate working with sets, tuples, and working with your data through the built in functions in MDX and Analysis Service 2008. Examples and demos will be common business cases you will use in your cubes day to day.
