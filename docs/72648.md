## Title: Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support
## Abstract:
### What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload, read crash dumps, and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems. Finally, you'll learn the basics of debugging SQL Server so that when you finally run into a problem you can't solve, you'll be able to help Microsoft support help you.
