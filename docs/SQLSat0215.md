## Speaker: Bradley Ball
## Title: SQL Internals, Recovery Models,  Backups! OH MY!
## Abstract:
### The more you know about SQL Server the more you understand how it works.  SQL Server is a product we use every day, and most of us know the big concepts.  At the 10,000 foot view we know what  Databases, Tables, and Columns are.   But what makes up those Databases, Tables, and Columns.  What are Records, Pages, Extents, and Allocation Units?  What are Full, Simple, and Bulk-Logged Recovery?  What are the differences between  Full, Transaction Log, Differential, or Filegroup backups?  This is an introduction to these concepts.  In this session you will learn about the internal Structure, Recovery Modes, and Backups and be better prepared to for Future Learning and Managing SQL!

# Principles of BISM Tabular Modeling
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#215---Jacksonville-2013)
Event Date: 27-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track:  BI (Auditorium 1)
## Speaker: Javier Guillen
## Title: Principles of BISM Tabular Modeling
## Abstract:
### Although BISM Tabular is a powerful analytical engine that can efficiently link data across multiple sources, it is common to get stuck when attempting to connect tables and generate calculations to leverage all sources in a single model.  Many issues regularly encountered by BI developers (and data analysts when using PowerPivot) can be attributed to violations of one or more of the relationship rules of the Tabular engine. It is necessary to understand those rules in order to handle increasingly complex semantic modeling requirements.

On this session, attendees will gain an understanding of the fundamental principles which must be followed to develop effective models in BISM Tabular as well as PowerPivot.

In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data.  I will end the session with a set of demonstration of how DQS works with different data problems to help you put quality back into your data.
