## Speaker: Katherine Fraser
## Title: What's my xVelocity? All about in-memory analytics
## Abstract:
### Originally called the Vertipaq engine, SQL Server 2012 uses in-memory column-oriented storage and compression to be able to process millions of rows with sub-second response time on desktop hardware. In this session we'll talk about how xVelocity is used inside PowerPivot and Analysis Services Tabular models to give performance improvements to data warehousing and business intelligence.  We'll look at the columnstore index and SSAS/PowerPivot implementations and what the memory limitations are.
