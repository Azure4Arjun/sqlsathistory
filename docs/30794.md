## Title: Introducing Microsoft's EDIM Products
## Abstract:
### Starting in the SQL Server Denali release, data takes on a new life in the business intelligence world.  Often forgotten, data management needs to be an integral part of your reporting systems.  Learn how Microsoft has made your life easier by incorporating external parameters, environments, and groupings into Integration Services.  They have also included impact analysis and data lineage, which can be tied to tables and SSIS packages.  Two additional newcomer products, data quality services and master data services, complete the quartet.  This session will use the first Community Technical Preview of SQL Server Denali to describe and demonstrate the enhancements to the four products that make up EDIM.
