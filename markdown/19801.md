## Title: The Data Loading Performance Presentation
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it. 

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and see a few advanced ways to boost your data loading processes.  

Among other topics, we will talk about: 

•	Minimal Logging 
•	Transaction Management
•	Bulk Loading Methods
•	Indexing Techniques for High Performance Data Loading
•	Properly Leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning
•	SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability
