## Title: SIOS -SANLess clustering for physical, virtual and cloud environm
## Abstract:
### Join this session to learn how to create SANLess clusters in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible. We will discuss high-performance clusters leveraging SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage for faster SQL application response times - no SAN (or SAN Admin required). We will also touch on methods for providing HA protection and native Windows Failover Clustering in Windows Azure or the Amazon Cloud. -- Topics covered -- High-performance storage and accelerating SQL Server without sacrificing availability; AlwaysOn Failover Clustering vs. AlwaysOn Availability Groups; HA and DR strategy for SQL Server in Amazon EC2 and Azure instances; Fast, cost-effective strategies to get HA and DR protection without a SAN.
