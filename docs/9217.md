## Title: MDX 101
## Abstract:
### Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to understand what a cube is.
Learn the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set and dimension. Well describe how to decypher a [] from a {} or (). We'll look at examples of each, and show how you can easily access the imense power of cubes with relative ease.
