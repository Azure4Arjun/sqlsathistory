## Title: Logging Messages in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Logging messages in your database is a common request, and there are a million ways to do it. This presentation will cover basic methods and progress through more advanced ones.  We'll also show how autonomous transactions (available in some database products, but not natively supported in SQL Server) can be accommodated with some interesting techniques.

We'll examine user-defined events, linked servers and the new SESSION_CONTEXT() feature in SQL Server 2016, to provide different levels of logging and transaction management, and cover their best use cases.
