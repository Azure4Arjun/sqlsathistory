## Title: Introduction to PESTER - TDD for PowerShell
## Abstract:
### An introduction session for using Pester to test your PowerShell code

I will show you can get started using Test Driven Development for your PowerShell scripting. 

We will examine Pester, the syntax and show plenty of demos and build a function that uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services Faces API to analyse Beards
