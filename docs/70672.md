## Title: Automate your SQL Server installs and configurations using Powershell Desired State Configuration
## Abstract:
### Database administrators are being tasked with managing a large number of SQL Server instances.  These instances can be built on premise, virtualized, physical, or in the cloud.  With Powershell Desired State Configuration, DBAs can not only automate the installation of SQL Server, but also any specific configurations needing to be applied to each new instance.  Powershell DSC provides a repeatable process to ensure all builds are done in the exact same way.  We'll cover what is Powershell Desired State Configuration and how a DBA can take advantage of it.  Next, we'll dive straight into a demo of the installation and configuration of two SQL Server instances from scratch.  

Some powershell experience is recommended.
