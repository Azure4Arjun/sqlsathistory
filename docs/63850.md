## Title: Install an AlwaysOn Failover Cluster and Availability Group
## Abstract:
### You have decided to install and deploy a Failover Cluster Instance and an Availability Group but don't know where to start. This complicated architecture has many moving parts (including Windows Clustering), and you are overwhelmed. How do you install these features? This session walks you through a complete AlwaysOn environment, in which we install and configure an AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instance and an AlwaysOn Availability Group across 5 nodes. We use both the GUI and T-SQL so that you know how, why, and when to use each method.
