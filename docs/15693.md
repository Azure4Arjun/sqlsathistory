## Title: Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events - Super Size
## Abstract:
### Extended Events are used to gather performance information to help troubleshoot issues within SQL Server. The data can further be correlated with the OS and application event data by directing it to the Event Tracing for Windows log file (ETW). DBAs often need to identify the source of issues hindering database performance. This session will explore the data provided in a 2012 System Health event session. Cases studies  live demos will show how to use the various targets to find current performance bottlenecks and historical trends over time.
