## Title: The Consulting Dilemma:  Is Inside or Outside of the Corporation the Right Fit for You?
## Abstract:
### Accomplished IT staff looking to make the next step in their career development are often tempted to abandon the traditional full-time employee role for that of a self-managed consultant. The biggest challenge is how to know which role is the best fit for you. This session will discuss the pros/cons of self-managed consulting with an eye to the skills it takes to really be successful on the outside. For those that fit, we will also cover several of the hidden traps of consulting, what you need to get started, and the six skills that you absolutely have to have (or rent) to make a go of it. Whether you are looking at this type of move near-term or just keeping your options open, this talk will give you the real-life lessons to make that next step with confidence.
