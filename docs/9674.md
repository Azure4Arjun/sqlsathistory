## Title: Writing Faster Stored Procedures and Functions
## Abstract:
### Stored procedures and functions are the mainstay of SQL Server coding. In this presentation you will learn techniques to locate problem  code and to improve it's performance.  Step 1 is to discover where the time is going using server traces, code to analyzes the traces, and the new Extended Events.  Once we know where the time is going we look at strategies to improve performance: Managing indexes on temp tables and why heaps are often the best choice for temp tables; determining if an index is helping; Rewriting scalar and multi-statement functions as inline functions and why it’s so important; mastering minimally logged operations and the “Go Faster” switch. Each technique is illustrated with examples
