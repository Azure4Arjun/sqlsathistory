## Speaker: Jeff Honsowetz
## Title: 3D printing at HP and spreadsheets; how HP broke free of data bottlenecks.
## Abstract:
### Join Jeff and guest speaker from HP to hear their story. In today’s complex world, we know inherently simple gets it done now. And “now” is the typical deadline of our supervisors. The difficulty is they demand tough requirements and often make changes that take extra time and staff. In HP’s world of 3D printing, they discovered a new simplicity in consuming data daily, pivoting quickly in new directions, and keeping their users in control within IT boundaries. Learn about HP 3D printing ingenuity in your own back yard and how Interject provided a spreadsheet platform for them to run even faster and collaborate on data in record time. What took months or weeks, now takes days or hours, and users need minimal training. 

Be the first 20 to attend and pick a cold red bull or hot latte/mocha that will be waiting. Even better, at the end of the session we will be giving another $300 lightsaber like last year that is too cool for the kids. Space is limited so arrive early.
