## Title: Social Engineering: Hacking People
## Abstract:
### "It is much easier to trick someone into giving a password for a system than to spend the effort to crack into the system."
This is a common line of thought in today's world of increased cyber-security dangers.
In this interactive session we'll take a look at how social engineering works, 
the psychology behind it and why is it still the most effective way to gain access to your company's secrets.
The best attacks happen when people don't even realize they are being attacked and 
in this session we're going to try to fix that and educate you on how to realize when someone is trying to hack you.
