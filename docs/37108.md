## Title: Big Data's Missing V: Visualisation. How do you BigViz your Big Data? 
## Abstract:
### We all know about Big Data: Velocity, Volume and Variety. What about the missing 'V" - Visualisation? What does “big data” look like? It has to be more than beautiful; it needs to convey the information and insights in a way that people understand. Further, people expect to be able to make actionable insights from their data, and how can we make big data friendly to users?
In this session, we will look at a mix of open source and Microsoft technologies for visualising big data sources, and ways of achieving BigViz harmony in your Big Data
