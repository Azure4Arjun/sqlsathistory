## Title: Power BI Embedded with RLS Access to the on-prem Data Source
## Abstract:
### In this session, I invite you to join me on a hike from the on-premise data source to the full Power BI Embedded sample solution. After a steep and long climb, we reach the summit from where we can enjoy the prospect of a complete Power BI Embedded sample solution with the non-domain users getting a Power BI report provided with them with row-level security on an on-premise data source and all without programming skills.

We start with an overview of the requirements for our Power BI Embedded sample solution, then we go to the question: "What is Power BI Embedded?". Next, we focus on how all components of our sample solution interact and configure in detail, and then we publish a first Power BI Report. Next, we want to prove that row-level security works and implement a solution for continuous monitoring. 

This is a 1-hour session that is a compact version of the Precon that was scheduled for 18.10.2019.
