## Title: (PL) How minimal logging can help me?
## Abstract:
### You have probably heard something about switching between FULL and BULK LOGGED recovery models and that it#39;s useful for minimally logged operations. But what exactly are these operations? How can you benefit from them and what conditions have to be met? Are there any downsides?

If you want to speed up data loading you should get familiar with minimal logging. In this sessiion I will show you real life examples (and - well - some not real life) how useful can it be, what downsides it has and how it changed over the SQL Server versions.
