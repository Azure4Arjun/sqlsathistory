## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what happens when a query is processed? Got a process that is running slow at the office and your boss in looking at you for answers? Want to look like a hero to your boss for fixing something that no one else could figure out? Then you might want to consider this session. Execution plans tell you what steps were taken to generate the results sets you did. In analyzing these plans, you can figure out what you are doing that is not efficient, so you can fix it. This session will give you the foundation you will need to do analysis so you can write better code and help your company with their performance issues.
