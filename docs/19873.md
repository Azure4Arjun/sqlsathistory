## Title: Build your own Virtual Lab
## Abstract:
### If you don't have the chance to work on different kinds of projects, it can be tough to grow all the necessary skills to further your career. Take control of the situation by building a virtual lab at home.

We'll begin the session by talking about why you might want to build a lab, and what you'll need to complete the task - nothing more than your home computer and free software. We'll review the basics of virtualization as it relates to VirtualBox. Finally, we'll dive into an example of building a Windows Server 2012 cluster, and talk about how you can use these networking and server skills to advance your SQL Server education.
