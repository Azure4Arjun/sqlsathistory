## Title: Tips and Tricks for the SSIS Catalog
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of the SSIS Catalog in SQL Server 2012, we can now manage our SSIS package execution and monitor performance and logs in a much easier manner than executing packages from the file system.  In this session, we'll walk through setting permissions for SSIS read-only access, executing packages from T-SQL or stored procedures, viewing the logs generated during a package execution, writing custom messages to the logs, and many other tips to make your use of the catalog easier!
