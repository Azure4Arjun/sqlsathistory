## Title: Running statefulset applications like SQL Server in K8s
## Abstract:
### Containers offer significant value to businesses including increased agility as well as the ability to move applications between bare metal or virtual machines in multi-cloud or multi-datacenters environments. This new design pattern provides elasticity for application services as well as high availability through container orchestrators like Kubernetes. However if organizations already move a step further for stateless applications, they still often isolate their stateful workloads like data services building new silos in their infrastructure. In this session we will discover challenges and solutions to run a stateful workload in a container world.
