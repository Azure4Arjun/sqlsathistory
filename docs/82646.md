## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: GDPR, A European Horror Story
## Abstract:
### Data platforms tend to accrue skeletons in their closets and have ghosts that haunt us over time. From orphaned data, to silos of data that get out of sync with the rest of our data. As of May this year, these all got a bit more scary with the GDPR coming into force. What once was an admin headache just turned into a major compliance risk.

Together we will talk through what GDPR is, how to know if it applies to you and the business that you work for. Looking at the scope of the regulation and understanding the rights of the data subjects and what we need to do to make sure that they are observed.
