## Title: Develop T-SQL code Defensively
## Abstract:
### The goal of defensive database programming is to produce robust database code. You will learn how to program defensively by reviewing real life examples. Also you will learn some of the most common scenarios when T-SQL code breaks because of changes in environment settings and concurrency, and how to develop T-SQL that does not break in such situations.
