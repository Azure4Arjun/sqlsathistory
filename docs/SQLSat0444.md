# Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-444)
Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.

# Date Dimension: Past  Future in One Script
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-444)
Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Date Dimension: Past  Future in One Script
## Abstract:
### All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most Data Warehouse designers will just use one provided by tools or create it in Excel, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all of the calculations and formatting up-front so the reports can be easier to create. Sample script will be provided that creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse and it only take seconds to run!

Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Scott Shaw
## Title: Navigating the Hadoop Stack
## Abstract:
### Hadoop distributions can be a complicated road to navigate. Application names such as Spark, Pig, Hive, Falcon, and Ranger are interesting but give no indication as to what purpose they server or how they can be helpful to your organization. We'll take time in this session to work through the various components (Hortonworks HDP ships with 23 projects) and find which ones fit into your specific needs.

# Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-444)
Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
## Abstract:
### Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

## Title: Create a Simple Operational Data Store
## Abstract:
### If you or your users frequently run large, sweeping reporting-style queries against your OLTP system, you know the pain of having your system grinding to a halt under the resulting strain.  One solution is to create a basic operational data store on another server where those big queries can execute.  In this session, I will share some scripts to create a simple ODS system and to automatically refresh your databases.
