## Title: De-Mystifying SQL Server Statistics
## Abstract:
### In order to build optimal query plans the SQL Server optimizer relies on statistics to estimate the size of the query workload, which determines the resources that get allocated to the query.

This session will demonstrate how to determine if your statistics are current, how to make them current, and how bad things can happen when they are not current.
