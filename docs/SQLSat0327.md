# On Transactions and Atomic Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-327)
Event Date: 30-08-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Gail Shaw
## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
## Abstract:
### If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, don’t do, it’s use enough transactions.
Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code.

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.

## Title: SQL Best Practices including tips and Tricks for optimizing your SharePoint Farm
## Abstract:
### SharePoint has become the defacto EIM tool for many large organisations and this comes with a huge responsibility for SQL DBA’s and BI consultants alike. SQL is the heart and soul of any SharePoint Farm and in this session we will be focussing on:
•	What architectural considerations there are for SQL from SharePoint
•	Real-world SQL requirements for SharePoint
•	Simple tips and tricks for SQL before deploying SharePoint
