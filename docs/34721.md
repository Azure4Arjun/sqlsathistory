## Title: Secrets of Enterprise Data Mining
## Abstract:
### If you have a SQL Server license (Standard or higher) then you already have the ability to start data mining.  In this new presentation, you will see how to scale up data mining from the free Excel 2013 add-in to production use.  Aimed at beginning to intermediate data miners, this presentation will show how mining models move from development to production.  We will use SQL Server 2012 tools including SSMS, SSIS, and SSDT.
