## Title: Wait Watchers: No Pain, All Gain Exercises to Increase Database Performance
## Abstract:
### We're all told to watch our weight and to exercise more. Join Dell Software experts who will show you painless exercises that you can do to watch your waits. You could even eat a Danish pastry while watching if you wish (Danish pastries not provided). 

In this session, you will learn all about SQL Server’s wait statistics; statistics that the database engine stores about the resources it is waiting on. Armed with this information, SQL Server professionals like you can make better informed decisions on which areas of your environment to tune to ensure greater impact on performance. Join this session to discover where to find, interpret, and use this information to tie down problem areas in your SQL Server environment. This won't be only be about how to fix that problem query, but we'll also talk about how to improve overall performance for all your users.

Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 13:15:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Incremental Load Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads.
 
In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will demonstrate some of the methods for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:
--Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate
--Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?
--Methods for detecting new and changed records
--Common incremental load design patterns

Event Date: 03-10-2015 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Ryan Casey
## Title: The "Data Loading Performance Guide" Presentation
## Abstract:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. There are quite a few factors that can help, or hurt your goal for tuned performance. For this reason, bulk loading with large amounts of data requires a strategy.

For that strategy, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called “The Data Loading Performance Guide.” The problem is that this guide is long and full of small details that can be confusing and daunting at first glance.

In this session, we will turn this whitepaper into a presentation about creating a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

We will talk about solutions to achieve High Performance Data Loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading, Indexing Techniques including Columstore, properly leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning, Truncate Partition, PolyBase, Delayed Durability, and more.

## Speaker: mahesh pujari
## Title: SSIS Monitoring Framework
## Abstract:
### Most Organizations use SSIS as the ETL tool of choice for Data movement. These ETL processes can vary from simple to extremely complex processes. Data from these processes can be consumed by a Data warehouse, various other internal systems or for reporting.
 
Monitoring these ETL processes from a centralized location can be complicated, and many times performance issues only become apparent when the process fails or continues to keep running abnormally. 
We shall talk about a framework to proactively monitor SSIS ETL processes for reporting and analysis and to examine performance trends of SSIS packages across servers over time.
 
This session will discuss the SSIS Monitoring framework and demonstrate a few visualizations to show a performance analysis of ETL processes with minimal effort.
