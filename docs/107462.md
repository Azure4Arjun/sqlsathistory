## Title: The modern Cloud Data Warehouse - Snowflake on Azure
## Abstract:
### The era of cloud data warehousing has finally begun. Gone are the days where you had to provision expensive servers and spend days configuring and tweaking to get the technical details right. Using cloud infrastructure, we can skip past the technical set-up and start loading data immediately.

Snowflake is a vendor offering a native cloud data warehouse, hosted on Azure. In this session, we'll introduce you to this new technology and explain the important concepts to get you started. Walking out of this session, you'll have all the knowledge you need to embark a project with Snowflake.
