## Title: HA/DR options with SQL Server in Azure and hybrid
## Abstract:
### What are all the high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) options for SQL Server in a Azure VM (IaaS)?  Which of these options can be used in a hybrid combination (Azure VM and on-prem)?  I will discuss how data is stored in Azure, and then go over the HA/DR options such as AlwaysOn AG, Always On FCI, Basic Availability Groups, Database Mirroring, Log Shipping, Backup to Azure, SQL Server data files in Azure, Azure Site Recovery, Azure VM Availability Set, and Azure SQL Data Sync.
