## Title: Backup Strategies are for Losers...of Data!
## Abstract:
### Defining and documenting a backup strategy in today's data platform is simply not enough to prevent a major catastrophe. For that, a company needs to define a recovery strategy that encompasses their backup solution with an appropriate, tested recovery plan. This session outlines the various backup strategies and how to implement them in a recovery scenario to minimize data loss.  This session will discuss various case studies of backup strategy implementations that neglected a strong recovery strategy and resulted in catastrophe for the company.
