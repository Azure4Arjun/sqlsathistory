## Title: Get to Know HDInsight and Start Mining Big Data
## Abstract:
### The adoption of Hadoop as a platform for mining big data has opened up a new world of analytic possibilites. Using HDInsight, the cloud-based service from Microsoft, you now have the ability to fire up Hadoop on demand to get the maximum value from large and unstructured data. 

In this introductory session, you will learn the fundamentals of HDInsight and Hadoop, you'll see how to provision your own cluster in minutes, and you'll know how to put the cluster to work by the end of the session. Practical examples that show clustering techniques and text analysis of unstructured and semi-structured data will be shown allowing attendees to implement their own cluster with minimal administration overhead.
