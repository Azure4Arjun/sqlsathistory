## Title: Drinking from the Azure Data Streams
## Abstract:
### Deriving value from your data can be hard even when the data is stood still.  Trying to get insight from your data when it is constantly changing and moving is even more challenging.  Being able to derive business value from your data as soon as the data is produced can offer real actionable insight.  Imagine being able to action telemetry data coming from machines in your factory or being able to post trades by looking at real time market positions.
 
This session is going to look at a couple of ways to do real time analysis on your streaming data.  We will capture the data, perform analysis on the data and also look at visualizing the data.
