## Speaker: Steve Stedman
## Title: T-SQL Productivity
## Abstract:
### Have crazy deadlines? Working long hours? Tasks that need to be done yesterday? This session is  all about getting things done faster tricks/tools you can use to improve productivity. Including macros, dynamic SQL, excel, and templates. The majority of this session will cover macros (because I am a fan) and shortcuts; however, we will also go over a few examples of dynamic SQL, excel, and templates. This session is designed for people who know how to write t-sql and will be semi-open to discussion; we want to hear your tricks/tips as well.
