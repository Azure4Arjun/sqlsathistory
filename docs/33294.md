## Speaker: Sven Aelterman
## Title: Introduction to FileTables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduces the first significant enhancement to FILESTREAM: FileTables. FileTables use the underlying FILESTREAM storage, but expose the stored data using traditional Windows file I/O APIs. In addition, they also support hierarchical data storage (read "folders"). This session will show how to set up your SQL Server instance to support FileTables, how to create a FileTable and how to access it using standard Windows file APIs.
It may be valuable to attend the Introduction to FILESTREAM session also.
