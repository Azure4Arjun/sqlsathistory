### Data is valuable, really valuable, but in many cases security is an afterhought to getting things done. But this approach can come at a cost, quite a heavy one in the event of a GDPR or PCI-DSS breach.

In this session we will look at four key elements that are integral to data platform security and how to implement them. By adopting a 'Secure by Design' approach you will reduce risk while also delivering value.
