## Title: Road to database automation: Database source control
## Abstract:
### Road to database automation addresses the challenges of database inclusion in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). The set of processes that enables this inclusion is designated as Database Lifecycle Management. DLM is composed by 3 main parts: data management and migration, data monitoring and data recovery. 
In this presentation I will discuss the DLM general concepts, with special emphasis on data management and migration, and present some strategies and tools (source control tools as Mercurial and Git and database migrations management tools as Flyway) that can be used to overcome the database source control phase.
Using automation as key factor to achieve database source control, database continuous integration and database continuous delivery. This session will not only unlock continuous integration and delivery phases but also enable agile practices that allows to mitigate/manage the gap between application and database development.
