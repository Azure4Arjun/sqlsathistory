## Title: The Data Management Discipline (with a focus on Data Warehousing)

### We begin this session with a very brief yet important framework for data management. Then we explore the different aspects of the enterprise data management discipline. Finally, we delve into the different methodologies to design a data warehouse. We will talk about the Kimball, Inmon,  Data Vault methodologies. This is a high level conceptual talk (no coding) designed to help both developers and non-technical individuals to understand data management, data warehousing, and Business Intelligence disciplines.
