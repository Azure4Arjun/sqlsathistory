## Title: Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
## Abstract:
### Imagine taking historical sales data and using data science to accurately predict future sales values. This is precisely the objective of time series forecasting – to predict future values based on previously observed values.

This session will introduce time series forecasting, and describe how different Microsoft BI products enable forecasting for various audiences, including the business analysts, IT developer, and even the Information Worker.

Topics will include Analysis Services forecasting by using the Microsoft Time Series algorithm with the Excel add-ins (Table Analysis Tools and the Client Tools), SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and script. This session will also introduce and describe the impressive new forecasting capabilities delivered in Power View with Office 365. As part of Microsoft’s new approach to simplify complex Machine Learning technology, forecasting in Power View enables powerful forecasting capabilities for the unspecialized Information Worker.
