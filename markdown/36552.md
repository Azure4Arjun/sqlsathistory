## Title: Smart Rats Leave First
## Abstract:
### IT jobs are notoriously short-lived, with most only lasting a few years.  Very few people keep a single employer for their entire career.  Knowing when, why, and how to leave your job is as important a career step as finding new work.  Learn about how to use job transitions as opportunities to develop your career.
