## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Picking the Right Fights with Your Server Team
## Abstract:
### Being a DBA is more challenging than ever—virtualized infrastructure, tiered storage and the cloud mean you may not know where you servers are, what disks your data is on, and you have less control than ever. In order to keep your databases performing and to provide an optimal environment you have to pick your battles. You have limited capital, and you only want to pick the most important fights.
In this session you will learn about how to choose battles and win (with data!):
•	How to configure storage and file systems for SQL Server
•	Why you should always compress your backups
•	How your virtual machines should be configured for SQL Server
•	What rights you and your servers need in Active Directory
•	Many more and more importantly—which battles NOT to fight
After attending this session, you will have a good understanding of how to talk with your peers in the infrastructure teams and make sure the key SQL Servers in your environment have the resources they need to perform great.
