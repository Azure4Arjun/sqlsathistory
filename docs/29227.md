## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: BLITZ! 60 Minute Server Takeovers
## Abstract:
### You're minding your own business in your corner office - well, no, you're a DBA, so it's just your cubicle - when somebody says, "Did you know about this SQL Server over here?"  Suddenly, you have to find out what the server's doing, how it was set up, and whether things are working correctly.  In this real-time session, Brent will show you how he tackles unknown servers in 60 minutes to find problems, take an inventory, and set the server up for easier management down the road.
