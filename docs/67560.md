## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: €20M+ fines and prison: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is coming, are you compliant? w/ Pete Moore
## Abstract:
### Co-presented with Pete Moore.

Do you hold data on EU citizens? If so GDPR applies to you.

From the 25th May 2018 organisations who fail to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure and demonstrate that they are compliant will be liable for a fine of €20M or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is GREATER. Also, prison.

As a professional who works with data it is wise to ensure that you understand GDPR.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer.

Let me repeat: I AM NOT A LAWYER.

I am not qualified to give legal advice. However, I do know a thing or two about delivering software. In this talk I will bring your attention to the main aspects of GDPR and discuss some of the consequences this has on the use of production data and database lifecycle management (DLM).

I will focus on technical problems that we need to address. You can (and should) hire your own lawyers to provide legal advice.
