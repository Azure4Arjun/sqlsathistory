## Title: Bitmap and Bloom Filter Indexing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### We look at how you can role your own indexing strategies to complement SQL Server's B+Tree; this session will refresh you on how SQL Server Indexes work, bitwise operations. We will then look at how Bloom Filters and Bitmap Indexing can be used to dramatically improve the performance of certain query patterns within SQL Server. Session is based partly on the blog series on Bloom Filters: http://tinyurl.com/bloomfilter
