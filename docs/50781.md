## Title: Bioinformatics on Azure
## Abstract:
### If people think about big data, they always think about Twitter or Facebook. But there are other areas where much more data amounts incurred and the analyzes are more complex. In this talk, we talk about a real example from bioinformatics. We will explain the actual scenario and how the various Microsoft platforms from SQL Server to Azure Data Lake and Power BI could help us â€“ or not.
