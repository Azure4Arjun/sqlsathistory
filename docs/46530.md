## Title: Essential Architecture for Bi in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### While more and more workloads have moved to virtual environments, the data warehouse is often one of the last physical server in the data center. However, that doesn’t need to be the case, in this webinar you will learn about the challenges of implementing your BI environments in a virtual environment. This includes your data warehouse, and its ancillary systems like Analysis Services, Integration Services and Reporting Services. Finally, we’ll talk a little bit about how Azure VMs can change this guidance.
