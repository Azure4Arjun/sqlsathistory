## Title: Building BI Solutions with Excel 2013
## Abstract:
### If you have not experienced building BI solutions with Excel 2010, be amazed at what you can do in Excel 2013.  In this session we will use PowerPivot, Power View, Quick Explorer, and other great features in Excel to build an Excel 2013 BI solution.  Microsoft has went "all-in" with Excel as their primary BI client.  If you want to get a first hand look at using it more fully, you will be amazed.  I know I was.
