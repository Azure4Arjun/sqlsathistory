## Title: Big Data - Hype or Reality?
## Abstract:
### We can read about Big Data nearly daily in the news and how Big Data helps for cancer care, can help you win Jeopardy and helps Facebook and Google to make a lot of money. But what is behind Big Data? In this session I will try to demystify the buzzwords and talk about what customers really want to do with it. We will also have a look at Microsofts Big Data offering including some live demos with HDInsight, Hadoop, Hive and Data Explorer.
