## Abstract:
### So you want to use AlwaysEncrypted, but your app is not using driver level parameters? Or you want to parameterize ad-hoc queries, without rewriting your application? Or you just want to pretty print your t-sql code? SQLDOM is here to help. Not very popular but extremely useful utility/library that can help anyone to intercept and rewrite queries during runtime so they meet feature requirements or just fix performance.
