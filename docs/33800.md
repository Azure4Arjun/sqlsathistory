## Title: Database Table Partitioning, The Next Step
## Abstract:
### In this session I will go over some of the techniques that I have used to implement database partitioning in a 2 TB OLTP database. This session will be about now that you have decided to use partitioning how do you determine what partition key to use? If my table is using multiple search criteria at different times how do I choose a partitioning key? What tables should I Partition? How should my partitions be stored?
