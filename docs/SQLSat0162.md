#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#162-Cambridge-2012)
Event Date: 08-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Dave Ballantyne
## Title: What's new in SQL Server 2012 - TSQL
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, the T-SQL language has been extended further to enable greater productivity and more optimal queries.
Following the ANSI SQL standard support has been included for PAGING and SEQUENCES. Many cumbersome sub-queries will be banished by the clutch of new analytic functions, but perhaps the biggest is the window framing extensions.  These now allow a true sliding window of data to process such common problems as rolling balances.

This will be a high-level look session, but will be diving a bit deeper to highlight some caveats as we go as its not all plain sailing.

## Speaker: David Morrison
## Title: Query Plan Operators Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### In this session we will deep an in-depth look at some of the most common query plan operators. We'll look at what they do, how they do it and the circumstances in which they are chosen. 

We will look at the good and bad aspects of each and why sometimes they aren't the right tool for the job. 
Using lots of examples we'll investigate the usage and impact they have on your SQL Server.

Hopefully you'll walk away from this session with the knowledge which will give you a deeper understanding of your query plans

# The Magic of SQL Server 2012 BI in SharePoint
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#162-Cambridge-2012)
Event Date: 08-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Duncan Sutcliffe
## Title: The Magic of SQL Server 2012 BI in SharePoint
## Abstract:
### This fast paced and fun session is a journey through business intelligence with SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint.  It begins in Excel and shows how PowerPivot can be used to build useful information, how the data can be fed to the desktop, and how a user can develop their own notifications from that data. It then moves on to transform the data into a more cube-like experience by using external data and shows how dashboards and presentation-quality visualisations can be built easily from tabular models.

Although this session is mildly technical, it is easy to grasp and uses 100% demos.

# Make Your Queries Fly With Columnstore Indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#162-Cambridge-2012)
Event Date: 08-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Make Your Queries Fly With Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you want to speed up your reports over your large tables by 10, 20 or even 50x? Those are the performance improvements that Columnstore indexes can give you – when used properly.
Often touted as a “BI” feature, in reality columnstore indexes can benefit any workload that involves some sort of reporting on large tables. In this session, we’ll first discuss how columnstore indexes work. Once past the basics, we’ll dive in and get dirty, looking at how to rewrite existing queries and change database designs to get the most out of this new index type.
If you are running SQL Server 2012, you can add a columnstore index to your large tables and gain maybe 4x performance – or you can attend this session and make things really fly.

# Inheriting a database for Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#162-Cambridge-2012)
Event Date: 08-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Niko Neugebauer
## Title: Inheriting a database for Developers
## Abstract:
### There are very few applications which are being developed from zero, the most are apps are simply inherited from previous development teams.

This session serves to show some easy implementable practices to follow after inheriting a database. Those practices allow to check some if the database design was done in regards to the actual data, or if while implementing some of the constraints and checks some tables were left behind. :)

The practices shown in this session will allow to check the database design and identify some of the possible performance degradations.

Do you really know if READ_UNCOMMITTED is safe for reporting?
Is being Optimistic really better than being Pessimistic?
Can SQL Server 2012 be the solution to all our problems or our worst nightmare?

I look forward to you joining me in this very revealing and thought provoking session where I will provide answers to all these questions and more and make you wish you had known all of this sooner.

## Speaker: Mark S. Rasmussen
## Title: Optimizing Storage and Performance Using Page and 
## Abstract:
### Since SQL Server 2005, we've been able to use the vardecimal data type to store decimals efficiently. With SQL Server 2008 came row and page compression, resulting in much better options for compressing our data. However, neither row nor page compression are panaceas! In this session I'll walk you through the internals of row and page compression, and based on that knowledge, enable you to better evaluate when to use which type of compression, if compression should be used at all. Once used, how do we determine its effectiveness? What are the pitfalls? I'll give you a full tool belt of knowledge to bring home and put to use on your databases.

# Partitioning Design for Performance and Maintainab
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#162-Cambridge-2012)
Event Date: 08-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4 (special)
## Speaker: Martin Cairns
## Title: Partitioning Design for Performance and Maintainab
## Abstract:
### Partitioning your data allows a whole host of benefits to the performance and maintainability of your databases but still seems to be a dark art known only to a few people.  With every release of SQL Server more features become available to help solve various problems and a lot of them require that your database has been partitioned for that feature to be used effectively.  The most recent feature requiring partitioning is Column Store indexes, without partitioning you would be required to drop them before modifying any data in the base table and then recreating them from scratch.
