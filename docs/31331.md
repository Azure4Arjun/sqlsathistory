## Title: Deploying Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects
## Abstract:
### Declarative database development has made great strides forward with the Visual Studio 2010 data tools allowing developers to focus on the model instead of the implementation.  But once you have the model, what are the options for deployment and what if your solution doesnâ€™t match the Books Online example?  The session will demonstrate multiple ways to deploy database projects using TFS Build, MSBuild, VSDBCMD, Powershell and more.  For each deployment method, automation and customization techniques will be examined and demonstrated (including the common requirement of deploying one model to multiple targets.)  Attendees will leave with a better understanding of database deployment options when using Visual Studio 2010
