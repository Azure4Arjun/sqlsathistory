## Title: Data Profiling Using SSIS Data Profiling Task
## Abstract:
### This session will be exploring the SSIS Data Profiling task to quickly analyze your data.  I will be reviewing the different profiles available, and explaining the limitations of the Data Profiling task.  I will be showing you how to use the different profiles to help you identify candidate keys, null value counts by column, dependencies between columns, length distribution, data format, etc.  
I will be performing a number of Data Profiling task demos that demonstrate how to use and configure the different profiles.  Knowing how to use Data Profiling and interpreting the output helps you quickly determine how best to migrate newly received data into your environment.
I will also be showing you how to use the Data Profiling task output to control your SSIS data flow.  Additionally I will also be showing you how you can store profiling output in SQL Server, so you can produce trend reports based on profile output information.
