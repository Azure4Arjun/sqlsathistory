## Title: Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
## Abstract:
### Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.
