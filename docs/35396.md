## Title: Perf Testing 2008â€™s Transparent Data Encryption
## Abstract:
### Everyone is getting hit with data security requirements. SQL 2005 introduced column-level encryption, but there are drawbacks to using it. The big security news in SQL Server 2008 is Transparent Data Encryption.

On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security "silver bullet". The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

How much will TDE affect performance in an OLTP environment? This session will help you understand what TDE offers, discuss the list of caveats, and explain the performance testing and results.
