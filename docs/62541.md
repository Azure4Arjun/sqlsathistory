## Title: Tracking Data Changes with Temporal Tables and more
## Abstract:
### The need to keep track of the ‘what’ and ‘when' associated with data changes is a common requirement for data driven applications.  However, the business requirements for ‘why’ and ‘how’ those data changes are tracked can be very application specific.  Fortunately, SQL Server has a few different tools to help us out.  In this presentation we’ll look at 
- Temporal Tables
- Change data tracking
- Change tracking
- Triggers
and how they can help you keep track of what’s happening with your data over time.
