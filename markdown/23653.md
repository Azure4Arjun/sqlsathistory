## Title: Creating an SSIS template using BIML
## Abstract:
### When creating an SSIS package, it is best practice to follow some kind of template.  The package configuration needs to be set up.  Logging needs to be set up.  The work that you do to set up this template is tedious at best.

In this session we will develop a template SSIS package using BIML.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.

We will create a package that has some specific connection strings.  We will tie those connection strings to configuration settings.  Then we will add custom logging.  We will then build individual SSIS packages to copy a list of tables to their destination.
