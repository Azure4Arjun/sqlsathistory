## Speaker: Jennifer Gartner
## Title: A Data Journey for an Analytics Company
## Abstract:
### Often the most challenging aspect of becoming a data-driven organization is determining where to start. Case in point: Icimo Analytics. As a company that transforms data into meaningful business value, we were neglecting our own data journey. Externally, we were transforming organizations into lean data machines while internally, we were still relying heavily on spreadsheets, multiple platforms and disparate systems. Turning our expertise inward, we designed dynamic dashboards fueled by Tableau and Alteryx to see a one-stop holistic view of our entire business. The end result? Each employee is strategically positioned to see, understand and make data-driven informed decisions driving value and setting the foundation for lasting growth and success.

## Speaker: Bill Anton
## Title: Power BI Time Intelligence - Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### Time-Intelligence refers to doing BI calculations across periods of time (usually dates), and is the most common type of analysis in business reporting. Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-to-Date (YTD), Prior-Month (PM), Prior-Year (PY), Month-over-Month (MoM), Year-over-Year (YoY) are all examples of Time-Intelligence calculations. There are many approaches to implementing time-intelligence into your Power BI solutions, including the use of built-in date tables and time-intelligence functions. In this session, we'll explore several of these approaches and the associated tradeoffs. We'll also learn about the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify more complex time-intelligence calculations. We'll also take the first step in mastering DAX by familiarizing ourselves with the CALCULATE function.

## Title: Classification With Naive Bayes
## Abstract:
### The Naïve Bayes series of algorithms are some of the simplest classification algorithms, but they tend to offer reasonably good results very quickly for a number of problems, including Natural Language Processing problems such as spam classification, as well as more classical feature-driven classification.  In this talk, we will look at the math behind Naïve Bayes classification, solving problems by hand before looking at a package in R which solves the problem for us.  By the end of this talk, you should be able to apply Naïve Bayes to existing problems.  No experience with statistics is required, although there will be a small amount of math.

This session will dive in-depth into proper data modeling and deployment using the Python language including:  
 
1.	Data extraction 
2.	Data cleaning 
3.	Data transformation 
4.	Data exploration and visualization 
5.	Predictive modeling 
6.	Model validation/testing 
7.	Deployment of the solution.  
 
Attend this session to learn how to use Python to conduct data analysis and modeling. We will use Python and packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and others to explore real-world datasets and build data models using proper techniques like feature engineering, splitting datasets into validation and training datasets, testing data models, interpretability of a machine learning (ML) models a
