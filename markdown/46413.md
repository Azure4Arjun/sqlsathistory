## Title: Azure SQL Data Warehouse – Elastic Data Analytics in the cloud
## Abstract:
### Join Microsoft TSP Josh Sivey as we explore Microsoft’s new Azure SQL Data Warehouse cloud service.  SQL Data Warehouse is a data warehouse as a service offering that offers petabyte scale massively parallel processing power, created and managed with the tools developers are familiar with.  In this session we will provision a SQL Data Warehouse in minutes and show how we can independently scale the storage and compute to meet the needs of the workload on demand.  We will showcase SQL Data Warehouse’s Polybase feature to allow us to write T-SQL queries across relational and non-relational data.  We will manage and maintain our SQL Data Warehouse using the tools we are familiar with (SSMS and Visual Studio).  Finally, we will show how SQL Data Warehouse seamlessly integrates with Power BI, Machine Learning and other Cortana Analytic services.
