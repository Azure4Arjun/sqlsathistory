## Speaker: Jeff Foushee
## Title: Transforming Data using the T-SQL PIVOT / UNPIVOT operators
## Abstract:
### Ever wish your horizontal data were vertical for easier data storage, or vice-versa for reporting purposes? Are you writing elaborate routines to transform data for one-time usage? Are your queries repeating “OUTER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, OUTER JOIN” or UNION, UNION, UNION” so often that you wind up back in Kansas when your read them aloud? Join Jeff Foushee as he explains SQL Server's lesser-known PIVOT and UNPIVOT operators in SQL 2014. After this session, you will no longer need to rotate your monitor!
