## Speaker: Neil Marchadie
## Title: SQL Server 2008 SSRS Changes 
## Abstract:
### This presentation would be aimed at current users of SQL Server 2005 SSRS focusing on the improvements and differnces in the latest iteration of SSRS.  Substantial changes in the BIDS layout would be covered along with the new enhancements in SSRS 2008.  I have been a trainer in the past and I've found it best that when I've made presentations my usual rule is to not allow any questions during the presentation, this avoids "presentation hi-jacking" by some attendees.  I aim at having at least the last quarter hour for questions.  I aim for above all an instructional and entertaining time.
