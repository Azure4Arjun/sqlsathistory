## Title: Going Spatial!
## Abstract:
### Spatial data is being pushed more and more into the forefront of our application universe. With the advent of MapPoint and Google Maps companies are consistently pushing the boundaries of what traditional databases can do. Now with SQL Server 2008 we have built in spatial data types that will make your life a little easier in the days to come. This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data as well as tools such as SSRS's integrating geospatial mapping to make you the company geospatial hero. Geospatial awesomeness fro everyone!
