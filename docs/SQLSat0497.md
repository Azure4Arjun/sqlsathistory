## Title: Habits of Highly Effective SQL Development Teams
## Abstract:
### t its most fun, software development is a team sport. Think of an NFL team. Does the quarterback know where the running back or tight-end will be? Does he do his job in a vacuum or with coordination and support from his teammates?

However, if the teammate isn't doing what they're supposed to do, the play dissolves and leads not only to losing a game, but also individual dissatisfaction. Come to this session to learn how to coordinate and communicate as a team, improving individual and overall developer effectiveness.  Learn how to overcome  particular obstacles unique to SQL Developers.

## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
## Abstract:
### Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

# Mysteries of Data Masking Revealed -  in Azure, SQL Server, and beyond.
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-497)
Event Date: 02-04-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Yevgeniya Mushkatblat
## Title: Mysteries of Data Masking Revealed -  in Azure, SQL Server, and beyond.
## Abstract:
### Data Masking, or Data De-identification, is a technique allowing a database practitioner to hide data with "false" values. Done in  response to the compliance regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, PCI and other, it allows securing data in variable ways based on the user role in the organization. Data Masking is not encryption! The strategies and algorithms would differ whether you need to use it in production or non-production environment and whether you need to apply it enterprise -wide or in separate applications. Learn about data masking as a part of privacy - by -design strategy and how to decide what to use and where.

## Speaker: Mickey Stuewe
## Title: Keeping your SQL Objects Safe In Development
## Abstract:
### It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.

## Speaker: Karen Lopez
## Title: The Key to Keys
## Abstract:
### So many of us have learned  database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one data modeling or development tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK?

These concepts span data activities and it's important that your team understand each other and where they, their tools and approaches need to support these features.

We'll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the database design process.  We'll also look at implementation options in SQL Server and other DBMSs.

## Title: VLDB: Partitioning in SQL Server Standard Edition.
## Abstract:
### Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition. You may be asking yourself, “Why is he talking about table partitioning?  Didn’t we just establish it’s only available in Enterprise and not available to us Standard edition users?”   Even though you’d be correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. Yes, I am talking about partitioned views.

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to demonstrate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining the use of both partitio

## Speaker: Sahaj Saini
## Title: PolyBase in SQL Server 2016: Query Hadoop with ease
## Abstract:
### With the increased volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data , organizations are adopting heterogeneous data stores like Hadoop and cloud, requiring new skill sets to operate and making it harder for DBAs to build applications over them. This session will describe PolyBase, a new feature in SQL Server 2016, that will open the doors to data stored outside of SQL Server. PolyBase allows customers to use T-SQL to access and query data residing in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. It can intelligently push-down computation to Hadoop by generating Map jobs on-the-fly as well as scale-out query processing in SQL Server to enable highly performant queries on massive Hadoop data sets. 

This session will cover the PolyBase fundamentals of what the feature is, how customers are using it and how it works under-the-covers. In addition, the session will include a Live Demonstration of how PolyBase can be used to bring relational and semi-structured data together using SQL skill sets.
