## Title: Event notifications for the proactive DBA
## Abstract:
### Event notifications in SQL SERVER have been around for a little while but seem to be one of the most under used features. Combine this feature with database mail and you have a first class alerting system. Come along to this session and find out how to use these features to become a truly proactive DBA.  Learn how to get notified about such events as deadlocks and blocking before your users even know they have taken place. Get details of most errors delivered straight to your inbox. Youâ€™ll leave this session with a full toolkit that you can start to implement straight away.
