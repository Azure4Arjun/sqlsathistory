## Title: Tintri  SQL Sentry - Optimizing Your Virtualized Workload
## Abstract:
### Learn how Tintri and SQL Sentry take the risk and guesswork out of virtualizing SQL databases. Tintri Virtual-Aware Storage (VAS) systems blend the predictable performance of solid-state disk (SSD), per-VM Quality-of-Service (QOS) and superior analytics to empower DBAs to confidently deploy even the most demanding enterprise applications. Tintri makes complex database management tasks like cloning, backup/recovery and test/dev refreshes a breeze through software automation that eliminates error-prone, manual processes. With the recent partnership between Tintri and SQL Sentry, DBAs can monitor specific performance metrics of their Tintri devices within SQL Sentry Performance Advisor. Stop by our booth and lunch session to see Tintri and SQL Sentry in action.
