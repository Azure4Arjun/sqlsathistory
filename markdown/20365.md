## Speaker: Michael Swinarski
## Title: The Most Ignored Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Everyone would agree that setting up, configuring, and applying best practices to a database server environment, is always easier to do in the early stages of deployment.   Yet too often, environments are built, grow, and become business critical, without such efforts completed until performance and stability become a problem.  This session will discuss how this keeps occurring, how we can avoid it from continuing, and some basic standards that should be found in almost any environment.
