Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?

## Title: 20 Minute Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Are you familiar w/ SSAS Multidimensional and curious about Tabular? Having trouble deciding between cubes and tabular models? Then this is your session!

Analysis Services Tabular was introduced back in 2012, and yet it has only just started to emerge from the Proof-Of-Concept phase to a legitimate production alternative in most IT departments. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models provide considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. And with major advancements in 2016, Tabular has never been a more appealing solution. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a Tabular model.

# SSIS Frameworks and Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#521---Atlanta-2016)
Event Date: 21-05-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: SSIS Frameworks and Biml
## Abstract:
### The material in this session ranges from introductory to advanced. 

Building small, function-like SSIS packages is an SSIS best practice. Biml helps generate lots of packages using design patterns. 

Now you have a bunch of packages - how do you manage executing them? An SSIS Framework can execute packages in a specified order, and it is driven by metadata. Need to make a change in execution order? Execute a T-SQL statement. 

How do you manage the metadata that drives an SSIS Framework? Biml can generate the metadata, as well.

Join SSIS author, blogger, and presenter Andy Leonard for this demo-packed session on Data Integration Lifecycle Management (DILM).

## Title: Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros
## Abstract:
### Finding any IT industry publication that does not frequently reference Hadoop and Big Data is nearly impossible. Even so, to many SQL Server professionals it remains a mystery. 'Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros' is designed to bridge the gap between knowledge of SQL Server and an understanding of Hadoop by comparing familiar features of SQL Server to Hadoop counterparts. Equally important is understanding how Hadoop is different and the use cases in which it compliments SQL Server. Of special note are the ways Microsoft is integrating Hadoop in its data strategy and related products. Perhaps 2016, Hadoop's 10th birthday year, is the time for SQL Server Pros to become familiar with this platform and how to prepare for it's introduction into our work as data professionals.

## Speaker: Shabnam Watson
## Title: A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics
## Abstract:
### You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SQL Server Management Studio, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

## Title: Microsoft Data Platform: The Open Space Session
## Abstract:
### Over the last few years, Microsoft has begun to articulate a broader vision of data beyond the flagship product SQL Server.  Azure, Hadoop, HDInsight, R; all of these products have begun coalescing into a platform which will take some time for professionals in the field to embrace.   The big question is: what do we need to know (as SQL Server professionals) in order to be prepared for the onslaught of Big Data?

This session will provide an interactive discussion around the Microsoft Data Platform, to build on our common experiences and knowledge.  As an Open Spaces topic, attendees are expected to participate fully in discussions.  I'll act as moderator, but there's no agenda and only a few slides; the content is completely up to the group.

Experience with other components of the Microsoft Data Platform is appreciated, but not required; the goal is to define "what we know we don't know" and to encourage self-motivated learning plans.

## Title: What is Biml?
## Abstract:
### 
You've heard about Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). Some people seem to be doing some pretty impressive things with it, but what exactly is it and will it work for you in your job?

Biml is a programming language for creating data warehouse, business intelligence, and other data solutions. It uses XML in combination with small nuggets of C# or VB code to automatically create huge amounts of SQL scripts, SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and other objects that your team previously had to build manually - usually with slow, tedious, error-prone dragging and dropping. Perhaps the best part is that there is nothing to install on your server - Biml works entirely with your existing data infrastructure.

Want to know more? In this session, you'll find out everything you need to know to get started using Biml.

## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

## Title: The HA Blueprint for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server allow applications to achieve high availability (HA) like never before, thanks to synchronous replication technology in AlwaysOn. This capability enables applications to use more resources on more servers, which can significantly improve scalability, performance, and resiliency. But to gain the full value of the SQL Server architecture, you are required to make code modifications at the application or database layers.  Deploying database load balancing software is an elegant way to gain enterprise-grade HA without code changes. In this SQL Saturday talk, ScaleArc will provide a blueprint for achieving HA with SQL Server.

## Title: SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know
## Abstract:
### As a production DBA, do you struggle to schedule heavy jobs to avoid times when the server is already overloaded? Have you ever felt like your end users notice data corruption, blocked processes, or a full tempdb even before you do? And have you ever been frustrated by the fact that Agent never stores quite enough job history to help you troubleshoot job failures? The fact is, SQL Server Agent can do way more than just schedule jobs at a fixed time.  In this session you'll learn how to make SQL Agent run jobs only when ample CPU resources are available, how you can be the first to get notified when data corruption has occurred, and how to use Agent for monitoring data file size issues. You will also walk away with a set of scripts that will help you customize job history retention.  By the end of this demo rich session you will understand how to leverage SQL Agent’s hidden gems that will make your database management job more efficient without requiring additional development time.

## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Skills Needed to Transition From DBA to BI Architect
## Abstract:
### Dimensional Modeling is a re-tooling of your existing database normalization knowledge. T-SQL and coding knowledge can transfer to ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) using Integration Services (SSIS). Report Writing has been around for decades and learning Analysis Services (SSAS) can save days of work that custom report writing has taken teams.

Development today requires the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) output. My personal transition from Sr. DBA to DW Architect has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end results analytically. These lessons have molded me into a DW Architect.

## Speaker: Brian Kelley
## Title: Securing the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Pipeline
## Abstract:
### In most organizations, "batch" processing happens at least nightly. Data is moved from one system to another, often with multiple stops along the way. We tend to do a good job securing the endpoints: where the data starts and where it ends up. However, the in-between drops are often neglected. 

In this session we're going to look at typical ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and consider the weak points an attacker might go after. We're going to eliminate FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) by looking at a few typical architectures, discussing risks at each point, identifying options for protecting the vulnerabilities, and what we've seen typically done (if anything) in practice. While this talk primarily uses Microsoft SQL Server as the example/guinea pig, especially the database engine and SSIS, the discussion will be applicable to any solution.

## Title: Partitioning Basics: Treating Your Tables Like Legos
## Abstract:
### Do you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!

With partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll  also look at how partitioning affects things under the hood. Finally you'll see some cool demos/tricks around index maintenance and data movement. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and know how to make decisions on how and when to implement.

## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

## Speaker: Matt Martin
## Title: Advanced Error Tracking for Quick Diagnosis
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will walk through how to build a detailed error notification service for SQL Server that will trap errors, and email you a well formatted and detailed error report on what went wrong. In many organizations, you typically have SQL agent jobs running, and when failures occur, you get a generic email with a jumbled up message about the error, but it doesn't really help you understand where and at what point did your stored procedure fail.
In this class, we will introduce and go through how to pinpoint errors in real time, and how to identify troubling areas or bottlenecks in stored procedures. In the end, you will have a notification and error handling system that sends you a well formatted email alert with an html table output to show you the events that led up to the error, and what exactly the error was.
This toolset has saved many developers and DBA's tons of time researching failures in jobs, and we hope it helps you too!

## Title: Administering SQL Server on Server Core with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what the craze of Server Core is all about? There is a lot of power in Core and with it comes the admin challenge of NO GUI.  But there are settings that you want to change in the OS, how do you do that? This session will take you through some of the challenges that are not really challenges when you know. We will use the builtin method of making some changes and also use PowerShell and commandline tools to get you where you want to be with Core. I built a 6 node cluster on Server Core and created it with PowerShell (Cluster and all) and it runs very nicely with a little footprint in RAM for the effort.

# SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#521---Atlanta-2016)
Event Date: 21-05-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project
## Abstract:
### Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

Biml Enabled SSIS Test (BEST) [https://github.com/bimlscript/best] is an open source framework that enables users to define unit and integration tests for SSIS packages using your choice of database tables, Excel files, or XML.

In this session, you will learn how to use BEST to author your SSIS tests and how to use free open source tools to report and visualize test results as part of your existing production processes.

Note that while BEST is implemented using Biml, you do not need to learn Biml to use it.

# Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#521---Atlanta-2016)
Event Date: 21-05-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Scott Currie
## Title: Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml
## Abstract:
### Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.

## Title: Backups  Restores: You're Not In Kansas Anymore!
## Abstract:
### There is no place like home, there is no place like home! When a database crashes and you have to recover it, this may be what you're saying to yourself over and over.  It can feel like a house just landed on you if you're not prepared.  Ok, not really, but recovering a database from an unexpected event is often just as terrifying! If you aren't prepared for it, it's really going to hurt.  So what do you do? You prepare. You plan. You practice.  We'll talk about how the backup  restore process works in SQL Server and how it can help you prevent a Wizard of Oz situation!
