## Title: How to Argue with Your Infrastructure Admins – and Win
## Abstract:

David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable insight into how to start and work through the common conversations with them on the SQL Server infrastructure practices that matter to you the most, and how to succeed in getting what you need while keeping everyone happy.
