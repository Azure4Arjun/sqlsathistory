## Title: SQL into R: an Absolute Beginners' Guide to R for the SQL User
## Abstract:
### SQL data can be exported to any number of data manipulation, visualization, and reporting packages, including R. But what, exactly, is R and why would anyone consider it when there are already so many other choices available? We will answer those questions by considering: (1) what is R? (2) how does it work? (3) why is it so popular (4) what is so special about it?
We will do this using side-by-side examples of R and SQL code, and by using the "pipe" operator in R to connect several operations to analyze a publicly-available data set. By the end of this session, the attendees will have the previous questions answered and be able to decide whether to consider R, or to stay with their current solution.

Event Date: 12-08-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: David Maxwell
## Title: Handling Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables can be slow, or require a lot of extra code to be effective. Fortunately, SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, also known as Temporal Tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to create temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples.

## Speaker: Robert Verell
## Title: Right-Size Your Data Files
## Abstract:
### Best practices for SQL Server indicate that when configuring tempdb, we should create multiple files for better performance.  So why is it this is often ignored for user databases, where our data is actually stored?

In this session we'll look into why having multiple files for databases and filegroups is important, even on solid state drives.  Then we'll look into some scripts and tools that will assist us in transforming our databases to be right-sized for performance considerations.

## Speaker: Amber Goins
## Title: Using SQL as the Key to Robust Automation
## Abstract:
### Kelverion Best Practices; Using a Persistent Data Store

It is Kelverion’s recommendation that in nearly every case runbook automations be implemented utilizing a small backend SQL database table or set of tables. This document explains why we make this recommendation.

Persistence

The ORCHESTRATOR data bus is extremely powerful but it is not persistent. This means that if the ORCHESTRATOR runbook server were to reboot or the services were to crash all data about executing runbooks would be lost. So a complicated multistep workflow that is counting on the data bus for its current state would need to be restarted manually by an administrator. That administrator would potentially need to take significant time to understand what parts of the workflow had run successfully and what parts were still needed. If a persistent data store is used at the backend, the last successful step in the process has been recorded in the database with all necessary information to continue the next step.

## Speaker: Wendy Pastrick
## Title: Read Dirty to Me - Isolation Levels/User Impact
## Abstract:
### Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.

## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
## Abstract:
### You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.

## Speaker: Dan (Annie) Xu
## Title: From SQL to DAX – another way of extract data
## Abstract:
### Summary: This presentation is to provide BI consultants and SQL developers with different DAX and tabular modeling solutions which can be replacements of SQL querying and high resource consuming ETL processes.
Abstract:
Many of us are coming from knowing SQL before they have been introduced with DAX or many of us know how to use tabular model through reporting tool but do not know they can use DAX as query language against a tabular model. 
Thus, I am glad to provide this presentation focusing on three areas:
1. How to use DAX as a query language to select columns (columns from multiple tables and from value); Group Data; Filter Data; Join Tables; Build customized calculations/measures 
2. How to use tracing tools to monitor the performance difference between SQL solution and DAX solution;
3. Use  a real life example to demonstrate how to DAX and tabular modeling  (Row Contexts vs. Filter Contexts+Bridge Table+Inactive relationship+extended table) to replace high resource ETL Processes
