## Speaker: Ami Levin
## Title: Where Are My (Primary) Keys?
## Abstract:
### In this session, we revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases—normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues—from a very hands-on, practical perspective. We also consider the benefits and challenges of using different types of keys (natural, surrogates, artificial, others) from multiple aspects, including data consistency, application development, maintenance, portability, and performance.
