## Speaker: Jeremiah Peschka
## Title: Rules, Rules, and Rules
## Abstract:
### Computers are governed by the rules of physics: electrons, drive heads, and disk platters can only move so fast. Understanding how these rules operate and interact leads to insights into application performance. Understanding why something might perform a certain way makes it much easier to understand the tradeoffs of a specific design.

Database systems are built according to those rules: memory is faster than disk which is faster than the network. Database schemas and queries are built within the rules of database systems. You will hit the limitations of these rules. If you know what the rules are and why they are in place, you'll know when it's time to break them... and how to succeed.
