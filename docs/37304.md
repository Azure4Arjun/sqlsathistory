## Title: Securing Microsoft SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Having a good understanding what security features are available and what configurations are considered best practice can be crucial to your  company's data security.  My experience at many dozens of companies indicates that more than 90% of all database implementations don't follow some of the most fundamental best practices.  Learn to view security differently and how key builtin security features can be leveraged to make your systems both more maintainable and more secure.
