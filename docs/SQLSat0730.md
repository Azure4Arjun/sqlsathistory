# Embedding PowerApps into a Power BI Dashboard
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-730)
Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence  Data Science
## Speaker: Callum Green
## Title: Embedding PowerApps into a Power BI Dashboard
## Abstract:
### PowerApps are a relatively new technology released within the Azure stack.  Its primary focus is to empower technical or non-technical developers to create quick and simple custom apps.  They can be used as standalone apps or embedded within websites/mobile apps.  On the other hand, Power BI is now a mature product and needs little introduction.

What if we could use PowerApps and Power BI together?  Can we embed a PowerApp into a Dashboard and give the end user the ability to write back data to a visual?  Come along to my session to find out.

The 1-hour session includes other technologies such as Azure SQL Database, Common Data Service (CDS) and Flow.  In particular, I will demonstrate how you integrate these technologies with PowerApps and Power BI.  Whilst all levels of expertise are welcome, users require prior knowledge of Power BI Dashboards and PowerApps.

Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration  Development
## Speaker: Kevan Riley
## Title: Tune the query, not the plan
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are a great resource when trying to tune a query, but often we get hung up on trying to fix what we consider to be 'bad' operators, for example table scans vs clustered index scans; scans vs seeks; sort operations.  In this session we will take a look at some misconceptions, step through what SQL Server is doing and see if we are actually improving the performance when we change the plan to have 'better' operators.

## Speaker: Rob Sewell
## Title: dbachecks - The PowerShell Module to validate your SQL Estate
## Abstract:
### As a SQL DBA you want to know that your SQL Server Estate is compliant with the rules that you have set up. Now there is a simple method to set this up using PowerShell and you can get the results in PowerBi or a report emailed to you on a schedule. Details such as

How long since your last backup?
How long since your last DBCC Check?
Are your Agent Operators Correct?
Is AutoClose, AutoShrink, Auto Update Stats set up correctly?
Is DAC Allowed?
Are your file growth settings correct, what about the number of VLFs?
Is your latency, TCP Port, PS remoting as you expect?
Is Page Verify, Data Purity, Compression correctly set up?

and many more checks (even your own) can be achieved using the dbachecks PowerShell module brought to you by the dbatools team.

Join one of the founders of the module, Rob Sewell MVP. and he will show you how easy it is to use this module and release time for more important things whilst keeping the confidence that your estate is as you would expect it

# Chatbots for Dummies
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-730)
Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence  Data Science
## Speaker: Jose Mendes
## Title: Chatbots for Dummies
## Abstract:
### The software development landscape is changing. More and more, there is an increased demand for AI and cloud solutions.  As a user buying cinema tickets online, I would like to simply ask "I want to buy two cinema tickets for the movie Dunkirk, tomorrow's viewing at 1pm" instead of manually following a pre-defined process. 

In this session, we will learn how to build, debug and deploy a chatbot using the Azure Bot Service. We will enrich it using the Microsoft Cognitive suite to achieve human like interactions. 

Will it pass the Turing test, no, but we can extend the bot service using Machine Learning (LUIS), APIs (Web Apps) and Worflows (Logic Apps).

# Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-730)
Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration  Development
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing
## Abstract:
### Until SQL Server 2016, the Query Optimizer and the Execution Engine were strictly separated. The Query Optimizer produces an execution plan that, based on statistics and estimates, should be fast. That execution plan is then faithfully executed by the Execution Engine, even if reality turns out to be different from expectations.

SQL Server 2017 changes this! Three new features now allow execution plans to adapt to reality. Memory Grant Feedback increases or decreases assigned memory based on past experience. The Adaptive Join operator allows the optimizer to create two alternative plans, the best of which will be decided at execution time. And with Interleaved Execution, parts of the plan are even completely recompiled mid-execution, with much better cardinality estimates.

If you are more interested in how all this ACTUALLY works than in shiny marketing slides, come to this session. We will spend the full 60 minutes knee-deep in execution plan internals!

# Harnessing Database Monitoring in a DevOps pipeline
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-730)
Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development  Continuous Integration
## Speaker: Mark Allison
## Title: Harnessing Database Monitoring in a DevOps pipeline
## Abstract:
### Showing how a Database Monitoring tool can be used in conjunction with a DevOps process can help prevent shipping performance problems to production. In this session we will be showing how you can

Use data captured from Database Monitoring tool to validate performance testing

Use a Database Monitoring tool as an input to release gates, to only release when defined performance metrics have been met.

Use VSTS extensions to visualise performance test failures

This allows us to automatically fail releases based on poor performance as captured by a baseline in downstream environments, and surface that information in the release tool so that a release manager can understand why a release in the pipeline was marked as failed. This will typically be things like, high CPU, logical IO, missing indexes, or deadlocks.

## Speaker: Sam Cogan
## Title: Azure Functions and Automation: The SQL Agent in the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Microsoft's Platform as a Service solution,  SQL Azure is a compelling solution for many who don't want to manage their own highly available SQL implementation. SQL Azure however does not replicate all of the services of on-premesis SQL, and one of these missing is the SQL Agent. This session looks at what alternatives exist for running and managing SQL jobs in Azure without SQL agent. In particular we will focus on Azure Automation and Azure Functions. The presentation will include a brief overview of the two services and how they are applicable to SQL workloads, followed by a demo of creating and running a SQL job.

# DevOps, Dev Data and the GDPR: 5 Solutions
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-730)
Event Date: 14-07-2018 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration  Development
## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: DevOps, Dev Data and the GDPR: 5 Solutions
## Abstract:
### It’s an age-old problem: developers want prod data for dev and test purposes.

It helps them to write better code and to test it effectively. Self-service access to usable test-data aligns well with DevOps principles that encourage teams to adopt a shift-left mentality to testing.

Unfortunately, in the age of data breaches and the GDPR it’s simply illegal to give developers access to some types of sensitive production data.

So what do you do?

In this session I’ll talk about the GDPR, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and 5 techniques you can use to provide appropriate data that is as “production-like” as possible (within the legal and technical constraints). I’ll demo these techniques both in raw T-SQL and using some of the Microsoft and third party tools that are available to make the task easier.

After this session you’ll be equipped to discuss the problem with your colleagues in an informed manner and you’ll be able to suggest several solutions and their relative pros and cons.

## Speaker: Mark Broadbent
## Title: Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!

## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: SQL Server hates you(?)
## Abstract:
### Have you had performance tank despite the code working fine in another environment? Maybe heard that some SQL is bad but not why? If so, this is the session for you!
This session will start with a walkthrough of some of the basic settings in SQL Server and how they affect you as a developer. It follows with key tips on what settings to change, why some code will wreak havoc on your performance and how isolation levels matter (and why NOLOCK can be an exceptionally bad idea!) The session is led by a 20-year DBA veteran who decided to try to help developers understand performance issues by seeing things from his perspective.
If you want to explore how default settings kill your performance, investigate why harmless SQL might not be quite so harmless and gain insight into how isolation levels affect function and performance, then this session will provide you with the tools to think outside the box and incorporate database engine knowledge into your developer prowess!

## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
## Abstract:
### Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store  Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.

## Speaker: Kamil Nowinski
## Title: Maintenance a database project and Continuous Delivery using Microsoft Data Tools in practical terms
## Abstract:
### A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as an amount of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain on the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.
