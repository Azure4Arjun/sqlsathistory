## Speaker: Magnus Ahlkvist
## Title: It depends - don't mistake your Google search for my database knowledge
## Abstract:
### "It depends". The answer to most questions about database development and database design. In this 60 minute session I will go through some "smart" solutions which turned out to be performance killers in the end. I will also try kill some myths about "best practices" in database development.
My powerpoints usually look terrible, so I will focus on T-SQL and execution plans.
