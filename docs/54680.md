## Title: Many â€“ to - Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Analysis Services Multidimensional Cube
## Abstract:
### Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect, Data Platform (SQL Server and BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.   This session applies, in most respects, equally to Analysis Services (MultiDimensional) 2008R2 and above.
