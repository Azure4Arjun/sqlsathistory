## Title: SQL Consolidation with Azure SQL Database: an IT Pro  DBA's view.
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database has come a long way, and for MS SQL, it's ahead of its other public Cloud competitors by miles. This session will look at the practical benefits of using a fully managed SQL Server database as a platform for traditional DBA-managed SQL consolidation. We'll take a look at the benefits in terms of technology and cost models, as well as a direct comparison with SQL Server on-premise and comparisons with other public Cloud providers. We'll also take a look at the most significant features that have been added in the last year that'll make you change your mind about adopting this as your next Database.
