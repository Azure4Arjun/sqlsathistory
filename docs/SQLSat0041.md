## Speaker: Aaron Nelson
## Title: Virtualize This!
## Abstract:
### With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital. With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen in minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments. In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments. Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.

# De-mystifying Execution Plan Analysis

Event Date: 24-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 1 Centennial Park
## Speaker: Dave Turpin
## Title: De-mystifying Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### Too often the query plan, or how the SQL Server engine actually implements the logical query, is ignored by developers and DBAs.  The reason for not trying to dive into the meaning behind the hyro-glyphic plan is simple: It's not easy to understand what all those icons mean in isolation, never mind as a collection.

This session will bridge the gap between the theory of internals, where the details are mentioned but not demonstrated, and the logical query.  A series of actual query examples will show how queries are treated by the optimizer and why; what to do to identify slow performing queries, and how to make simple adjustments to allow the query to perform significantly better.

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-41)
Event Date: 24-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 1 Piedmont Park
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Patterns 
## Abstract:
### Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Tuna Helper for SQL Server DBA's
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Wait-Time Based  SQL Server Performance Management
## Abstract:
### There are many ways to use SQL Server Wait types for performance tuning of a Microsoft database, but often there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait event data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait event data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using wait type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: RESTful Data
## Abstract:
### REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With WCF Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This session will describe OData (the Open Data Protocol), the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.
