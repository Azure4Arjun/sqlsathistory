## Title: Diagnosing Performance with Wait Statistics
## Abstract:
### Wait statistics get more complaints about a lack of documentation than just about anything in SQL Server. The documentation that is available is not always very clear. Let's clear up these gray areas once and for all.

This session will cover what you need to know about wait stats like the best way to investigate them, how to interpret their meanings, and which wait types are important and which can be ignored.
