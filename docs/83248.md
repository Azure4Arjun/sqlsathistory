## Title: Database best practices for applications
## Abstract:
### Whether you’re an experienced application developer or seasoned database administrator application databases can be, unexpectedly, tricky even when they shouldn’t. SPA, MVC, and form applications can all benefit from a well architected and tuned database. This presentation will outline database best practices that I have derived from over a decade of application development. These practices improve small to large applications and range from heavy database dependent applications to those that don’t seem to benefit from a database.
