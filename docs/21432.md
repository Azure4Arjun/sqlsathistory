## Title: Enhance SQL Performance by Messaging and Queuing Applications
## Abstract:
### When you think of SQL Server, the first thing you think about is probably not SQL as host for messaging / queuing applications.

In this session we will see the benefits of messaging applications inside SQL as well as what options you have when implementing it and their respective performance implications.
