## Speaker: William Barnes
## Title: Where Do I Start? A guide for the new SQL Techie.
## Abstract:
### How do you get what you need to be a DBA... or anything for that matter? Well, this session is built around giving you not only great resources to help bridge those knowledge gaps... but is a great place to have an open discussion regarding ideas around education, certification, and how to build your own testing environments. Expect me to try and pry a conversation out of this room.
