## Title: Service Broker - for Good and ETL
## Abstract:
### This session will go over what is service broker, how does service broker work and how it can help with a near-realtime ETL process.
Service broker allows for asynchronous operations to occur on a database.  Using this, you can push data from your operational database to a data mart and provide users with near realtime access to live data without risking an impact on the live system with blocking or deadlocking.
