## Title: Top Free Tools for Tuning SQL Statements
## Abstract:
### In this demo-packed session, you’ll learn practical tips and tricks for SQL code tuning to help you with some of the most problematic and troublesome SQL coding issues.  Using a variety of free community tools, you’ll learn tips and tricks you can take home and immediately apply to your SQL code. You’ll learn things like: 

1.	A little-known technique to create a tiny version of large production databases, yet deliver query execution behaviors as you would see in production.
2.	Sneaky DBCC commands which help you replicate a full production server on your workstation, as well as how to turn on and off specific query engine optimizations.
3.	Best practices in reading execution plans using the free tool, Plan Explorer. 
4.	A variety of T-SQL techniques, including the best way to write a cursor, a quick trick that can save you 20-30% processing times on your big stored procedures, and some weird situations where SQL Server doesn’t use cached plans when it should.
