## Title: Creating an Azure SQL Database Using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database provides an environment to quickly build SQL Server databases.  This allows for testing of new versions and functionality with minimal effort.  PowerShell provides cmdlets that create, configure and deploy an Azure SQL Database quickly and easily.
