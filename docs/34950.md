## Title: Intro to SQL Server 2008 Full Text Searching
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2008 contains the functionality you need to issue full-text queries against plain character-based data in SQL Server tables. Full-text queries could include words and phrases or multiple forms of a word or phrase.Come learn how to setup your own full text searches in your applications. Give your users search capabilities into their data. It's as easy as 1-2-3!

In this session, the attendees will learn not only how to use the standard full text search functionality, but how to customize the built in list of “noise words”, to be able to add and remove words that should or should not be ignored. In addition attendees will also learn how to customize the thesaurus for their own needs. DBAs will also find helpful queries
