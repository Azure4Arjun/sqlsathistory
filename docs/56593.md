## Title: Always Encrypted at rest and in motion
## Abstract:
### Does your application work with the sensitive data? 

Always Encrypted is one of the newest SQL Server 2016 features, that provides a new way to encrypt columns. Data is protected at rest and in motion. You can encrypt your sensitive data on the client, send across the network and store encrypted data in the database. The database administrator can't read your data without special key. Always Encrypted provides a separation between those who own the data and those who manage the data.
