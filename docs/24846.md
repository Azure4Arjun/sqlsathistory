## Title: MDX vs. DAX: Currency Conversion
## Abstract:
### Compare and contrast how multidimensional and tabular achieve the same end result in quite different ways. Learn where multidimensional decorates the metadata of the model, while tabular offloads responsibility to DAX. Understand how the design goals of the DAX language – which are akin to Excel formulas and relational-database concepts – differ from MDX and traditional OLAP. Features covered can be used in a broad range of scenarios (not only currency conversion), adding valuable knowledge to your SSAS arsenal.
