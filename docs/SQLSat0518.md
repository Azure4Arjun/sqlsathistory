## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

# Virtual SQL Servers. Actual Performance.
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-518)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 10:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Virtual SQL Servers. Actual Performance.
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 
This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

# Unseen Minions: Improving Parallel Processing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-518)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Josef Richberg
## Title: Unseen Minions: Improving Parallel Processing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Some SQL Server Integration Services use cases are too complicated to simply read data from a source and write it to a destination. You could try looking for a third-party framework or components to help, but then again, you might just need to add some knowledge. This session is designed to help you maximize the parallel processing capabilities of SSIS.

We’ll cover in detail alternative methods of managing large workloads by using traditional programming methods, including named pipes, queues, and producers/consumer architecture – all from within SSIS itself. We'll then cover methods of dividing workloads and preventing bottlenecks, as well as techniques to improve the resource efficiency of SSIS.

Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 13:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Maintenance Plans: Planning to Fail
## Abstract:
### SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig hates using maintenance plans. He believes they don't scale well and frequently lack flexibility.  Maintenance plans are easy to set up and deploy. Deploying them to many servers is cumbersome. Modifying them on multiple servers at once is an exercise in futility. 

The dirty little secret is that anything you can do with a maintenance plan can be done with T-SQL. And by leveraging several community-based solutions, you can accomplish anything without maintenance plans.

# Taking the pain out of database migrations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-518)
Event Date: 04-06-2016 - Session time: 13:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Chris Lumnah
## Title: Taking the pain out of database migrations
## Abstract:
### Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.

## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: The Art of War with Bad Code
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. There is usually just one of you who has been tasked with managing one or more SQL Server instances while there are hundreds or even thousands of users of which a certain percentage will inevitably write poor code. So you must battle it out to identify the culprits before they wreak too much havoc on your systems. We will see several fairly straightforward techniques to positively identify the culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. TSQL and Extended Events code examples will be provided that you can use immediately in your environment to become more productive.
