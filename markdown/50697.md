## Title: Troubleshooting Skills for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Watching someone who is good at troubleshooting complex issues is like watching a magician perform on stage. It looks easy but unless you have the skills and know the trick, it can be black magic to you. Many DBAs and technology professionals can easily look in Books Online to find an answer to a technical question or how a SQL Server feature works. But where do you look on how you would become a better DBA at troubleshooting issues? How do you do you identify the root cause of the issue? This session will cover different approaches and skills to be a more efficient problem solver which is critical when your production system is down and time is money. The session will also cover how to create and present the root cause analysis so your team can learn from the mistakes and fix the issue.
