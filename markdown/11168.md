## Title: Get Your Nights  Weekends Back from SQL Server Planned Downtime
## Abstract:
### Major disaster events resulting in unplanned downtime get all the pressâ€”but planned downtime constitutes almost 80% of the outages in any IT environment. This downtime is typically for tech refresh, migration projects, and OS/SQL Server patching. And when do you have to schedule the large downtime windows required to accomplish these upkeep tasks? Nights and weekends. Like you don't have better things to do then! In this session, learn how you can get the safety of a parallel deployment with the speed of an in-place upgrade for OS and/or SQL Server as fast as SQL Server can stop  restart, no data migrations for tech refresh, low-impact break/fix, and planned downtime windows of less than 2 minutes.
