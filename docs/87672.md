## Title: Essential Linux Skills for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Unlike many other DBAs, the SQL Server DBA is finding themselves managing databases running on Linux without the server support or knowledge of a local Linux Administrator.  
This extended session will provide the attendee with a full immersion into the Linux world.  You'll learn the history behind Linux, how to design an enterprise level Linux environment to support a SQL Server database and what tools, scripting and monitoring have served other database platforms running on Linux since it's inception.  The session will provide an electronic handout that will serve as excellent reference material even after Summit is over, providing continued value to the DBA, the Architect and even the Database Developer.
