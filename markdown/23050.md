## Title: Creating a Performance Baseline for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Creating a Performance Baseline for a SQL Server should be the first task any DBA accomplishes when inheriting the instance.  The Performance Baseline provides a starting point for any performance optimization efforts, a point of reference for future performance comparisons, and documents the server and instance configuration.
