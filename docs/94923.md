## Title: In-Place vs Side-by-Side SQL Upgrades; Clearing the Confusion
## Abstract:
### Most of us are aware that when it comes to upgrading our SQL Servers, we have a couple different options when it comes to the methodology.  Do we perform an In-Place upgrade or a Side-by-Side?  Both options come with a myriad of pros and cons, and there's usually a "best" solution for every environment.  This session will attempt to examine exactly which scenarios lend themselves best to each technique, and we'll provide a logical way of thinking about this critical step and how to accomplish this with the least stress.
