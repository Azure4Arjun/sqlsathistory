## Title: How to be agile building the data warehouse with WhereScape RED
## Abstract:
### An agile project to build the data warehouse is a natural way to handle model, process and rule changes caused by a better understanding of requirements, data, and data quality during a project.  And yet designing, building, changing and documenting a data warehouse is still a laborious exercise that makes agile difficult.  By using WhereScape's flagship RED data warehouse automation software to remove to automate the mechanics of building the data warehouse you can accelerate delivery cycles and get agile.  That’s the way the business wants to work with IT – and the way that data warehouse developers want to work with the data.  Come and see a demonstration of data warehouse design and build automation – developed in WhereScape RED and implemented in SQL Server.
