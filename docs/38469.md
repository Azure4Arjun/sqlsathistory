### SQL Server 2016 CTP2 has been released, with it come a number of big enhancements and new features for the Availability Group feature. In this session we will look at a number of these changes and how they now mean you can build more resilient systems and also the new options available for your Data Platform design. I will walk you through some of these and demonstrate some of the configuration options and how they impact the behaviour of your applications.
