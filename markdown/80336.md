## Title: Troubleshooting Always On Availability Groups Performance
## Abstract:
### This session is dedicated to a thoroughly examination of Always On Availability Groups in action. Various demos show how to analyze functionality and performance in the different stages in the life of an Availability Group: Initialization, Synchronization, and even Failover. We will follow the streams of data from insert on the primary to redo on the secondary and thereby gain a deep understanding of the architecture of availability groups with its special queues. We will also see the potential of the performance overhead on the workload and lag of a synchronous replica.  Get ready for a pure demo-session using DMVs, Extended Events, Perfmon and Wait Stats methodology.
