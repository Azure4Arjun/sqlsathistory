## Speaker: Steve Jones
## Title: A Tour of Azure DevOps and TFS
## Abstract:
### Learning how to orchestrate your software development process can be a challenge, and many people don't know where to start using the tools available. For Microsoft stack developers, Azure DevOps and TFS provide cloud and on-premises tooling to manage your code. 
In this session we will look at the integration of work tracking with Scrum templates and Kanban boards with version control for your code. We will discuss and demonstrate pull requests to help manage the flow of work within a team and explain the build, test, and release tools available for your database and application code. 

At the end of this session, attendees will be more comfortable getting started with their own project in Azure DevOps and using the tools with their own team.
