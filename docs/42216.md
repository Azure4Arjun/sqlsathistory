## Title: Habits of Highly Effective SQL Development Teams
## Abstract:
### t its most fun, software development is a team sport. Think of an NFL team. Does the quarterback know where the running back or tight-end will be? Does he do his job in a vacuum or with coordination and support from his teammates?

However, if the teammate isn't doing what they're supposed to do, the play dissolves and leads not only to losing a game, but also individual dissatisfaction. Come to this session to learn how to coordinate and communicate as a team, improving individual and overall developer effectiveness.  Learn how to overcome  particular obstacles unique to SQL Developers.
