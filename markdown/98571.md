## Title: Performance tuning with SQLGrease
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning a production system can be a difficult process when only relying on out of the box tools.  This is even more difficult if you aren’t on the most recent release of SQL Server.  In this presentation I will show you some common performance problems and how SQLGrease can help tune these.  Along the way I will provide details on how SQLGrease collects its data in order to give some clarity on how we monitor as well as provide some useful queries you can use even if you aren’t a SQLGrease user.
