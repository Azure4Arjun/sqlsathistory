## Speaker: David Morrison
## Title: Statistics, Estimation   Plan Caching - The Big Three
## Abstract:
### In this session we will take an in depth look at statistics, how they are built, stored and used. We will go over why they are so important and what role they play in selecting a query plan. We will also take a look into estimation and how this affects query plan selection and how estimation and statistics tie together.

Also in this session we will take a look into plan caching, what it is, why it is done and how it can be both a help and a hindrance.

Using lots of demos and examples attendees will leave the session with a greater understanding of these three key areas and also the tools and techniques to work with and understand them in their own enviroments
