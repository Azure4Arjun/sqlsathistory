## Speaker: Hiram Fleitas
## Title: The Power Platform Game Changer
## Abstract:
### This is a game changing session. Lets go 0 to 100 real quick by building a business app in minutes using PowerApps, Microsoft Flow and SQL Server. Then lets look at the  enterprise-grade security to publish and share your app to iOS, Android, Web and Windows 10.

- AGENDA:
1. T-SQL Stored Procedure on SQL Server database (on-prem or cloud).
2. PowerApps (Inputs, Button, Outputs)
3. Flow (Input, SQL Server, Variables, Respond, Tests)
4. Gateway 
5. Publish  Share with Enterprise Governance.

We'll have time for QA. Maybe we'll even ask Cortana a few questions. I look forward to seeing you there!
