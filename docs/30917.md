## Title: Start Using MDX with SSAS 2008
## Abstract:
### MDX is difficult to learn for many reasons.

Learners are left to fill in the blank in a way that is not comprehensive, consistant or comfortable. This presentation will give beginners (and those beyond) a more comfortable grasp of how to write queries.
