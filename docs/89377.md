## Speaker: Frank Quintana
## Title: Hadoop 123. NoSQL, Not Only SQL SQL Everywhere
## Abstract:
### Since the end of the previous decade, our profession has been kicked by a set of new models, technologies, and architectures that are revolutionizing our practice. I pretend to clarify the position of SQL as the LINGUA FRANCA for Data and the relational model versus the allegations of deprecation of the relational model, and the NoSQL movement presentation of SQL as a language with no future. These among others are the topics of my presentation.
In this presentation, I will depict the Hadoop evolution from version1 to version 3,  and its relation to legacy architectures models and in particular to SQL.
