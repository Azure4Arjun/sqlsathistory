## Title: Agile BI from the cloud with Team Foundation Services
## Abstract:
### Agile BI promises to deliver value much quicker to its end users. But how do you keep track of versions and prioritize all the demands users have? 

With Visual Studio Online (cloud version of Team Foundation Server) it is possible to start for free with 5 users, with Version Control, Work Item management and much more.

In my session you will get the directions to a quick start with Visual Studio Online.
You will learn the possibilities of Version Control and in which way to implement Scrum work item management with all available tools.
