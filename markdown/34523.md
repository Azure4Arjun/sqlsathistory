## Title: Powershell and Perfmon - A performance story
## Abstract:
### It turns out there might be something better than the combination of beer and peanuts (at work anyway); using Powershell to gather Performance Monitor (perfmon) metrics!  In this session we will tackle gathering all the perfmon counters, storing them and alerting when they reach a defined level.  This will be a demo intensive session that will also use SQL and XML components of Powershell.  Attendees will leave this session with ideas and examples that they can implement in their jobs immediately.  A basic working knowledge of Powershell syntax and commandlets will be assumed.
