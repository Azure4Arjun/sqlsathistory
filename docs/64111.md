## Title: Why you should be BI curious
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence. It's a rather all-encompassing term, isn't it.

In this beginner level session, learn the basics of Business Intelligence, the stages of BI maturity and get introduced to the Microsoft BI Stack, starting from the humble roots of Reporting Services, through to the incredible power of Interactive Dashboards in Power BI.

Whether you're looking for a different career option, or you're just interested in broadening your knowledge base, come and experience the wonders of being (in) BI! 

Note: This session comes packaged with a series of double entendres and other innuendos.
