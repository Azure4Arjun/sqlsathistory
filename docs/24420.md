## Title: Indexing Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### A solid understanding of clustered and nonclustered indexes and a thorough look at their costs and benefits.  This will include looking in execution plans to see how indexes are used, going through the buffer cache to see the memory costs and benefits, and a complete look at how they fit into a strategy to improve page life expectancy and server performance.
