## Speaker: Geoff Johnson
## Title: Intro to Ranking and Aggregate Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Window functions greatly simplify the syntax and efficiency of queries that mix scalar with aggregate values. Learn how to add aggregate values to a query result without a GROUP BY clause, how to add row numbers and ranking values to query results, and how to subdivide a set of results evenly into a given number of parts.
