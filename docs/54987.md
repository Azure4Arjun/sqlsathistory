## Title: Save code changes on your SQL Servers with Event Notifications
## Abstract:
### Do you love unknown changes?  Missing indexes?  Empty reports? Unless you have a rigid change control process, finding the culprit isn't easy! You need a list of changes, and you're probably going to have to play detective to get it, looking through change tickets, wikis, log files, or even asking coworkers. SQL Server offers this capability in many forms, but the best for larger environments is a feature called Event Notifications. While you can save code and configuration changes locally, for maximum effect you can send changes from across your environment to a centralized location in real time.  

Additionally, with it you gain other abilities, like real-time monitoring of deadlocks, warnings from SQL Server's errorlog, failed login attempts, datafile growth and more.  You can automatically provide change reports to your auditors, even add the changes to source control. Get ahead of the technical curve and go from reactive to proactive!
