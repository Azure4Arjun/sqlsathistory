## Title: Dealing With Difficult Managers
## Abstract:
### We have all encountered difficult managers that leave us stressed out.  They can be micro-managers, bullies, too timid, or even just apathetic.  In any case, you are currently stuck with this manager, and you need coping strategies!
Through case studies and open discussion, we will help you determine if you indeed have a difficult manager.  We will identify and categorize behavior patterns of managers so that you can determine the best strategies to deal with him or her.  In addition, we will also explore the consequences of these actions, and how they can help you to succeed in furthering your career.
