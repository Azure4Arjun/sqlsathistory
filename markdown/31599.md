## Title: Does your Query and Reporting tool 'work'?
## Abstract:
### Studies show that in most cases the Query Tool is not the problem! Today's challenge is Data, and no one can help manage your data better than WhereScape RED.  

WhereScape and Microsoft have partnered for the newly announced Microsoft SQL Server Fast Track Data Warehouse 3.0.  WhereScape RED provides Native support for Microsoft SSIS, SSAS, and T/SQL for the agile production of enterprise-level data integration and transformations solutions.

WhereScape RED is an IDE for managing data warehouses, marts, stores and vaults.  RED is the only product that supports the entire data management life cycle by integrating source system exploration, schema design, metadata management, scheduling and enhancement into a single integrated design.
