## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Uncovering Duplicate, Redundant,  Missing Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you know if your database's indexes are really being used to their fullest potential? And do you know if SQL Server needs other indexes to improve performance? 
Attend this session and learn how SQL Server tracks actual index usage, and how you can make use of that information to improve the state of indexes in your database. We will use this data to identify wasteful, unused,  redundant indexes, and explore performance penalties you pay for not addressing these inefficient indexes. Finally, we will dive into the Missing Index DMV and explore the art of evaluating its recommendations to make proper indexing decisions.
