## Speaker: Sean Werick
## Title: SQL Server 2016 and PolyBase
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on the brand new SQL Server 2016 feature called PolyBase. PolyBase#160;is a technology that accesses and combines both non-relational and relational data, all from within SQL Server.  It allows you to run queries on external data in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. The queries are optimized to push computation to Hadoop.

In this session, you will learn how to install and set up PolyBase, and how to use it once you've got it configured.
