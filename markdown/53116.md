Event Date: 24-09-2016 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Biml
## Speaker: Ben Weissman
## Title: Biml: Your 3D Printer for SSIS
## Abstract:
### In this demo-heavy session, you will learn about the basic concepts of increasing productivity by creating your SSIS packages using Biml.

We will look into manual Biml code to understand the general idea of Biml, then take it from there and generate a whole staging area from scratch and end with a complete manageable solution to completely maintain your staging process using SQL tables.

Have you ever spent hours fixing your SSIS due to a schema change on the source? Ever wanted to add a "load timestamp" to 370 tables in your staging area but refrained because it would have taken you weeks to do so? If so, this is the session for you!
