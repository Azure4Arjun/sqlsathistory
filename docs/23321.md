## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Lego Sets: Relational Building Blocks
## Abstract:
### Do your eyes glaze over at the mention of tuples, domains, or even basic SQL terms?  Have you moved to SQL Server from MS Access, or Excel, or other non-relational database products?  This session will help explain the basics of set theory and relational theory using actual Lego blocks.  We will illustrate terms and concepts such as joins, unions, and set-based operations, and how you can translate them into actual SQL.  If you're an absolute beginner to SQL, or feel overwhelmed by the baggage of computer data models, or would just like to play with Legos, you'll both enjoy and learn something during this session.
