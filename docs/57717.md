## Speaker: Gerhard Brueckl
## Title: Power BI for the Data Scientist
## Abstract:
### R is THE language for Data Scientists. Therefore, it is no surprise that Microsoft also integrated it into the latest release of PowerBI. In this session I will show how to use an existing R-script in PowerBI, combine it with other data sources and leverage other native features of PowerBI like cross-filtering, highlighting, etc. The final step is then to publish the workbook to the PowerBI web service, schedule refreshes and share it with your colleagues.â€‹
