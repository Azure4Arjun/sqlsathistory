## Title: Evolving Your BI Environment From SSRS To Power BI
## Abstract:
### With Power BI becoming a leading BI tool over the last few years, a question arisesâ€¦ What does this mean for the existing SSRS environment? This session will explore an analysis plan on your existing reporting landscape to provide you options and considerations to be able to make an informed decision about how Power BI could best be used in your environment. You will learn how to get valuable SSRS usage metrics. You will understand the benefits and limitations between the two BI tools and what questions to ask your users. By Monday morning you will be able to provide an analysis plan on what is involved to introduce Power BI into the enterprise.
