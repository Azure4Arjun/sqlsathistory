## Title: SQL Server 2016 R Integration - how do I do it and why would I want to??
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server 2016 we introduce language extension so that you can execute R scripts from within the SQL Server database engine. In this session I will go over the basics of setting up and executing this functionality, discuss the types of problems that you can solve with it, and when you might want to avoid it.
