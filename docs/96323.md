## Title: Defining What's Normal -- The Basics of Database Normalization
## Abstract:
### Determining how to efficiently design database structures for a given application has always relied on the same old answer: "It depends!" So, how do you determine what level of normalization your data requires?  This session will review the principles of data normalization, show the impact that normalization can have on performance and data integrity, and just as importantly, show you when it's OK to break the rules and denormalize.  We will cover some case situations where it's better not to be normal!
