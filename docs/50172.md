## Title: SQL Azure Database - No CDC, no problem!
## Abstract:
### 
Azure SQL Database, No CDC No Problem!
Come see how I solved that lack of CDC in SQL Azure Database by leveraging a new feature in SQL Azure database and SQL Server 2016- Temporal tables. In this in depth 300/400 level session I will demonstrate the techniques that I created to simulate CDC in SQL Azure Database. We will examine the code that implements the solution, the code that automatically writes code for you and a wizard that makes it simple to consume.
