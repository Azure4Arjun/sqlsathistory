## Title: Business Analysis with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### You can make advanced business analytics also with T-SQL, you do not need to use R, Python, or some other currently fashionable language for every single in-depth view in your data. In addition, you can get magnitudes better performance inside a database management system when in statistical languages and engines. You will learn how to use T-SQL for queries that you might already be familiar with, for aggregating queries. But this is only to warm you up. Then you will learn how to do hazard and survival analysis, market basket analysis with association rules using different measures like support and confidence, and even sequential market basket analysis, when there is a sequence in the basket. Then the session introduces the look-alike model, which is a mixture of k-nearest neighbor and decision trees algorithms. The session finishes with Bayesian inference implemented with T-SQL.
