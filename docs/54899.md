## Speaker: Andy Mallon
## Title: Inside the Management Studio
## Abstract:
### Host Andy Mallon persuades some of the biggest names in SQL Server to give up some surprisingly personal information during his chats with them in front of a worshipful audience of database professionals.

The interviewees talk about their childhood, how they got started in the business, their early career, and behind-the-scenes trivia. The interview concludes with the Proust Questionnaire, made famous by Bernard Pivot (Apostrophes) and James Lipton (Inside the Actors Studio). After that, students can question the interviewee directly.
