## Title: Code Management with SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will introduce you to SQL Server Data Tools.  With SSDT, you can create database projects to act as the system of record for your database schema.  You can also utilize SSDT to automate SQL code deployments into multiple environments.  And did I mention the tool is free? Your SQL code can finally be treated as a first class code citizen.
