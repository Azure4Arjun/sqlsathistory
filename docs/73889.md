## Title: Power BI for the Faint of Heart - Building an Interactive Report
## Abstract:
### You've heard about Power BI, and you've seen it, but you haven't yet rolled up your sleeves and got your hands dirty. It looks like it is really easy, but sometimes it helps to have someone step you through it the first time to help you hit the ground running. We will grab various public data sources, join them together in a model and build an interactive piece de ré·sis·tance on the visual design surface!
