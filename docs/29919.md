## Title: Anti-patterns in Database design and T-Sql code
## Abstract:
### Simplicity and power of Microsoft SQL Server allows us to design and develop the working solution in virtually no time. Although there is a significant difference between the system that just works and the system that works efficiently. One of the challenges architects and developers often face is that the best practices and methods commonly used in the client development cannot be applied in the database world and rather hurt the systems than help them.

The session focuses on a few obvious and not-so-obvious anti-patterns commonly encountered in production database systems. It shows how to refactor them and improve the system performance.
