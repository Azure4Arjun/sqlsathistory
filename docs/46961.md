## Title: Query Store Overview and Architecture
## Abstract:
### Fixing performance problems and detecting query regressions has never been easy in SQL Server as the database engine fundamentally does not capture the relevant information.
With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has introduced a feature called Query Store that will help you capture vital query metrics that will help performance troubleshooting and regression detection.
In this session we will examine Query Store, examine it's architecture, configuration and how it can be used to solve real-world performance problems.
