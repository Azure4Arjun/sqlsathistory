## Title: Page  Row Compression Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Page and Row Compression are powerful new tools. Page  Row with SQL 2008 RTM, and Page  Row with Unicode Compression with SQL 2008 R2.  We can turn it on, we can turn it off, but we want more!  What are Access Methods and how in the SQL Engine do they affect Compression?  What are the “Gotchas” of Page Compression?  How does Compression differ in the way it treats Non-Leaf  Leaf Level pages?  What additional functionality did we get in DBCC Page, DMV’s, Perfmon Counters, and Extended Events to support our usage of Compression?  How do complex query plans affect Compression?  Come find out!
