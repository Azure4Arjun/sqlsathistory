## Title: Cut the tables into partitions v.2
## Abstract:
### In February 2018. at the meeting of the Warsaw Data Comunnity group, I was talking about partitioning. Due to the great interest, I decided to repeat this session but in a slightly changed form. During this session, one of the techniques of database optimization will be presented which is the partitioning of tables and indexes of the SQL Server database. This allows you to improve performance, understood as the speed of access to data and facilitates management. Partitioning is related to various mechanisms such as partition switching, partition sliding window or partition elimination, which can be helpful in everyday work. Basic terms, methods of partitioning, advantages and disadvantages of good practices will be discussed. I will mention the myths of partitioning. Everything will be supported by examples.
