## Title: SQL Sprawl - How to get a handle on your Infrastructure
## Abstract:
### This Session will give you the tools to assess your existing SQL Deployments, physical or virtual.  
Determine what’s being installed without (or without) your knowledge.  
How are they being utilized resource wise and how are they licensed.
Then determine what can be combined, right sized or retired and does your existing licensing make sense.
This will provide a road-map to make a case for virtualization (if you’re not there yet) or just to get a handle on your SQL Sprawl.
