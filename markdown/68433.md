## Title: Weird stuff I saw ... while supporting a Java team
## Abstract:
### After spending more than a decade completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I did some time supporting a Java team. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. But it is a different stack, different culture, and different group of folks giving bad advice to developers ... just enough different to keep life interesting. Come hear about my misadventures with server side cursors, output parameters, integrated authentication, and NOCOUNT settings.
