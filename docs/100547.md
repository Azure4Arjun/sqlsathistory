## Title: An Introduction to Spatial Data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Over a decade ago Microsoft added the capability to store and work with geometry and geography data types. (Wait...what's this you say?!?) Well, yes...it's been there for quite some time now. You can actually store spatial data in SQL tables (in the form of points, lines and polygons). There are also many powerful, built-in functions that allow the manipulation and calculation of results around this data. This is a powerful, but sadly underused feature of the product given that IoT tends to be so focused around the location of things. 

Come to this session to learn about: 

● The two elusive data types (geography and geometry) 
● T-SQL Spatial routines and functions 
● How to load spatial data 
● Where you can get lots and lots of free spatial data to supplement your existing systems 
● See an example of real-world Spatial data in use (aggregating truck positions for tax calcs) 
● Write a SQL query from a bitmap picture (pure amusement)
