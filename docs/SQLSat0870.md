## Speaker: Kevin Wilkie
## Title: Azure Data Factory V2
## Abstract:
### Moving data around in On-Prem databases is easy. 

Moving data around when involving Azure - may be not. Especially if you don't have a VM or an On-Prem server to move things around on. 

We'll look at moving data around from On-Prem to Azure, moving files to Azure, and moving data between Azure databases.

# Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#870---Memphis-2019)
Event Date: 05-10-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets
## Abstract:
### You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: Managing Your Schema with Database Projects in Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### Integrating databases schema changes into a Software Development Lifecycle Management (SDLC) process can be a  daunting and often tedious proposition. Adding the complexity of version control to the mix complicates this scenario. Fortunately, Database Projects in Visual Studio add a bit of an "easy" button to this process. In this session, you will learn about the features and capabilities of VS Database Projects and how to use them to improve the lifecycle of your database structures, even if your organization does no code management.

# SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#870---Memphis-2019)
Event Date: 05-10-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Paul Stanton
## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
## Abstract:
### DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

# Relational Design Critique
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#870---Memphis-2019)
Event Date: 05-10-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Relational Design Critique
## Abstract:
### The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.
