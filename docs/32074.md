## Title: Backup  Restore Basics
## Abstract:
### The key to being able to recover data in an emergency is to have a good backup and to know how to restore that backup to get up and running again as quickly as possible. In this session we'll talk about how to design a backup and restore strategy that's a good fit for you, including discussion around the types of backups that can be taken. We will also work through a couple of demos showing backup and restore in action. After all a backup is only good if you can restore it.
