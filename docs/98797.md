## Title: Troubleshooting PowerBI Performance Problems
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a great tool for mashing up and visualizing data. If you are not careful though, you end up with visuals that take too long to load and a PBIX that exhausts available memory.  This session shows you how to maintain the crisp performance and stunning compression that you want in every data model.

 To help with the optimization effort, Dan will demonstrate common tools for troubleshooting Power BI performance issues. He will also review some common mistakes that drain the life from models and provide ways to avoid these pitfalls.
