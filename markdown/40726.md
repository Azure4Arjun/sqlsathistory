## Title: The need for Speed : SMO Internals for High Performance Automation
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder how Management Studio gets information for the Properties dialogs it shows?  SQL Server SMO consists of objects that can be used to manipulate SQL Server and the objects it contains. Ever wanted to get information about a database without opening Management Studio, or writing a query against DMVs? Ever wanted to change a property of a database without writing an ALTER DATABASE statement? This session will cover a few main objects in SMO and how to manipulate them using SMO as well as learning a Turbo button for your automation using SMO. Join us for a great time while we take a look behind the curtain and seeing how SMO really works. The session will have a majority of demos to give us time to really see how things work and how you can control things to get just what you want as fast as you can.
