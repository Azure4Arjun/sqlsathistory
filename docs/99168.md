## Speaker: Thomas Jorczik
## Title: SQL Server high availability in cloud and hybrid environments
## Abstract:
### SIOS Sponsor Session: Many believe that enterprise applications running in the public cloud are guaranteed to have high availability. But no cloud service provider currently guarantees uptime at the application level. There are, of course, ways to assure high availability for critical applications running in private, public and hybrid cloud environments. But that responsibility lies with the enterprise, not with the cloud service provider.

This session, presented by SIOS Technology, will highlight important information business and IT staff need to know to provide both high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) protections for critical applications – and specifically SQL Server – running in public and hybrid cloud environments, as well as on-premise!
