## Title: Temporal Tables in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Temporal Data is one of the new features that will allow user's to audit data changes over time, that will be released with SQL Server 2016. With this feature, it will be possible, to see our records on a "point-in-time" perspective. Join me in this session, to take a look and talk about this new great feature that will change the way we can handle and audit data, or even recover some data that got changed by mistake.
