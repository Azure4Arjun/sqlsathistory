Event Date: 08-12-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: DBA Worst Practices, Disasters and Horror Stories
## Abstract:
### Join Brian Moran, Tim Radney, Mike Walsh and perhaps a few more special guests in a panel discussion on some of the worst practices we often see DBAs do. A little secret - we've done them, too. We'll tell you some of the ways you are hurting your databases, tell you about some of the disasters we've been involved in and even share a few horror stories of the ones we've caused. We'll leave plenty of time for QA and give you a chance to share your own or stump us with a "what would you do...." question.
