## Title: SSRS Administration - Enter a BIDS Free Zone
## Abstract:
### You are about to enter the BIDS Free Zone. Beware! This session is NOT about report design, spatial data, R2 new features or .NET extensions. We will explore what the ReportServer and ReportServerTempDB databases contain. By understanding their purpose we can discuss, for your company, what recovery mode each should be in and select backup strategies. Furthermore, we will talk about two other resources to backup: the ever critical encryption key and XML configuration files. Next, we'll cover the three scalability options: caching, snapshots and scaling out. There are numerous server configurations that are familiar to administrators just hard to find. Some are so hidden you might not know they exist!
