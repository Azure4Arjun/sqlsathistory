# Why Normalization Matters
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-13)

## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Why Normalization Matters
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of the common normal forms and show why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). Properly structured data structures make it easier to work wit

# Wait-Time SQL Server Performance Management
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-13)
Event Date: 25-04-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 2
## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Wait-Time SQL Server Performance Management
## Abstract:
### There are many ways to use SQL Server Wait types for performance tuning of a Microsoft database, but often there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait event data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait event data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using wait type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

# Disk Performance Hands On
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-13)
Event Date: 25-04-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Disk Performance Hands On
## Abstract:
### Would you buy a million dollar race car then show up to the track on a clear day with rain tires that aren’t properly inflated and wonder why you’re only doing 180 when the manufacturer says it can do 220?

Your answer was probably close to something like “Of course not!”. Now let’s suppose that your “million dollar race car” is really your DB server and your “tires” are your hard drives. Do you know the right configuration to use to get the best performance out of them? Sure, there’s RAID 1, RAID 10, and RAID 5…but do you know which combination of partition offset, RAID stripe size, and allocation unit size to use?

# End-to-End Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-13)
Event Date: 25-04-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: End-to-End Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server can be very difficult.  It often takes years of on-the-job experience to learn how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  This hands-on session will take you from the very start of a problem situation on SQL Server, showing you how to use the native tools that help you keep SQL Server at top performance.  This session will detail and demonstrate:

-	Performance Monitor (PerfMon)
-	SQL Profiler/Server-side Trace 
-	Correlating PerfMon and Profiler results
-	Graphic Explain Plan and Transact-SQL Showplan
-	SQL Server 2005 and 2008 DMVs

# Surviving the Data Avalanche
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-13)
Event Date: 25-04-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Surviving the Data Avalanche
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server database platform is hosting larger and larger databases.  But the industry term “Very Large Database” (VLDB) is more difficult to define than ever with multi-terabyte database becoming very common.  This session will answer questions like:

-	How do I configure my SQL Server instances to support multi-terabyte databases?
-	What risks and problems do VLDBs pose?
-	How do I overcome issues presented by VLDBs?

Administrating and protecting very large databases is extremely difficult and very hard to learn except through direct experience.  This session helps you learn from the experiences of others so that you can apply their lessons learned and mitigate your risks before you ever experience them.
