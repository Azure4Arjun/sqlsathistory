## Title: Monitoring Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### So you have successfully configured Availability Groups, now what? In this session we will look beyond setup and look at how to monitor your Availability Groups.

You will walk away from this session with tools you need to monitor your environment and know how to respond to alerts.  This session is for anyone that uses, or plans to use Availability Groups. You should come in with a basic understanding of Availability Groups to get the most out of this session.
