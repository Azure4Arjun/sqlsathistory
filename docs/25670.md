## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: SSIS 2012: More Than Just a Pretty UI
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) 2012 added rounded corners and Undo/Redo to the designer, but what else was added to make this worth the upgrade? In this session there will be as many demos of the new features as we can get through! Along with the rounded corners, you will also see the changes to deployment, SSIS catalog database, metadata/XML updates, Parameters, logging updates, Data Taps, ODBC support, script debugging, PowerShell interface and many others. If you haven't seen what has been updated in SSIS 2012, this will be the session to cover the most!
