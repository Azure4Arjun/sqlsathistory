## Title: Beyond the Basic SELECT
## Abstract:
### The SELECT statement is one of the most used tools in our SQL toolbelt. While it’s the basis for what we do with data, it’s anything but basic. In this presentation, we will first explore how SELECT statements are processed. Then we will discuss various ways we build on to our SELECTs. We'll also examine how and why we may or may not want to use them. At the end of the session, we will have a greater understanding of how SELECTS work and how we can approach them so we can be smarter as we write more complex statements.
