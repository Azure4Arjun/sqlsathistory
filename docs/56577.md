## Title: Cloud BI with Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Azure Analysis Services (Azure AS) was released in Public Preview and it gives us possibilities to create full-managed Cloud BI solution without using on-premise servers or VMs,  installing and configuring any software. Now, we have full set of PAAS and SAAS services like Azure SQL DWH, Azure AS and Power BI for creating our BI solutions. In this session I will introduce Azure AS and how we can use it together with other Azure services for creating complete BI solution in the cloud.
