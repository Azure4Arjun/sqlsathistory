## Title: What is "Project Apollo"?
## Abstract:
### Project Apollo introduces Columnstore index in Denali. Columnstore
index can potentially improve data warehouse query performance on
large fact tables (star joins and aggregation) by creating a highly
compressed architecture. It utilizes the same vertipaq algorithm used
by Powerpivot.  Only the data for the columns selected in the query is
brought into memory. Columnstore index is recommended primarily for
read-only workloads.The demo will include scenarios which will benefit
from using columnstore index and will highlight best practices for
using columnstore index.
