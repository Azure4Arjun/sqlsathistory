## Title: Automatic database tuning with Query Store
## Abstract:
### Query store is new feature introduced in SQL Server 2016. The main purpose of this feature is to simplify the process of performance troubleshooting by tracking the queries being executed on the database over the time. Query store collects metrics for execution plans, query texts, execution statistics and hardware resources consumption over the time. 
Some of the scenarios where the Query Store feature can be useful are:
	• Find the most expensive queries for CPU, I/O, Memory etc.
	• Get full history of query executions
	• Get information about query regressions (new execution plan is worse than the older one)
	• Force specific query plan and Automatic plan correction
	• Automatic index tuning
	• Provide useful insights about needed code improvements
This session will include overview of the Query Store capabilities, configuration instructions and live demos showing the main capabilities. We will also cover Query Store improvements for SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 versions.
