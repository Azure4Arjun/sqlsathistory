## Title: Understanding Disk I/O Performance in SQL 2005
## Abstract:
### Understanding Disk I/O performance can lead to improved overall SQL Server Performance. In this presentation we will look at the effects of RAID, SAN how to configure them for optimal disk performance. We will also cover how to measure the performance of I/O through perfmon and look at some simple ways to graph and manage this data so that over time we can understand the effects of I/O performance on the SQL Servers we manage.
