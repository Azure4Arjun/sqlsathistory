## Title: Azure Machine Learning Services and Kubernetes – Taking models into production
## Abstract:
### On December 2018 Microsoft announced the general availability of Azure Machine Learning Services. This component contains many advanced capabilities designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. In combination with Azure Kubernetes Services it has never been easier to facilitate everything from development to operation for machine learning models within Azure.

In this session we will go in depth in both components with demos from a machine learning project from Bane NOR. We will also discuss different Machine learning framework in Azure, and how Azure stands as a Machine Learning platform compared to its biggest competitors.
