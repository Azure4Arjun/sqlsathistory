## Speaker: Steve Hood
## Title: Buffer Pool Memory Management
## Abstract:
### Understand what's in memory, why it's there, and how to reduce the footprint if that's reasonable.  Find your large queries with several techniques, justify them, and tune them. Find indexes to drop, consolidate, or create.  Finally, purge your data, because even our accounts hire pyromaniacs with scissors!
