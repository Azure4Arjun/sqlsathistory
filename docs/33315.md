## Title: Conceptual Data Modeling: Defining Our Data
## Abstract:
### Data modeling is the process of defining structure for data. Some systems might make this seem like something that occurs in a deep well at midnight with water-soluble markers, but a well defined data model can provide greater system longevity, less complexity in application and reporting development, better capability for performance improvements, and less long-term volatility. This session will discuss concepts of data modeling, signs of a well defined model, technical and non-technical benefits we can use for approaching different audiences, and some of the tools we can use in different stages of modeling. We'll wrap up with a practical example of converting business language into the first stages of a conceptual data model.
