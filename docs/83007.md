## Title: GDPR – New age of data protection and privacy
## Abstract:
### The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, 2018 heralds a new era of enhanced personal privacy rights and adds additional duty to companies for protecting data. However, it’s not just about protecting the privacy of personal data of EU citizens. Data breaches such as at Target, Equifax, Uber and many others, result in loss of customers, loss of profits and cost executive jobs. A survey by Forrester reveals that 74% of individuals are ready to switch to a competitor if their bank or insurer suffers a data breach. Security and Privacy capabilities ranks as the number 1 initiative by 55% of organizations in a 2017 Customer Priorities  Journey Survey.

In this session, we will discuss all things data protection with the Microsoft Data Platform. Whether it is to comply with the requirements of GDPR or ensuring that your data is the most secure it can be.
