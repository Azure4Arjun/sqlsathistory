## Speaker: Lee Moran
## Title: PBI ❤ AI
## Abstract:
### Since its inception, Power BI has gradually folded more and more AI-powered capabilities into the platform so that some very complex and incredibly useful functionality is now easily accessible to a wide range of data-savvy users.

Come and join Lee Moran, organiser of the Perth Modern Excel and Power BI User Group, as he walks you through the many ways you can tap into this great capability and understand how Microsoft’s goal of “democratising AI” can really take the insights surfaced in your Power BI report to the next level.

In this demo-heavy session, Lee will cover everything from the Analytics pane on line charts through to some of the newly released capabilities around a simple mechanism to interface with published, enterprise-scale Azure ML models.
