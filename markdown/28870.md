## Title: Storage Optimization and Data Availability
## Abstract:
### Optimizing storage and implementing comprehensive data protection strategies are essential for a highly performant, reliable SharePoint environment.  SharePoint and SQL Server natively provide capabilities in this regard, but they prove inadequate for most organizations. In this session, we will discuss key components for a successful SharePoint backup and recovery plan, including extended and archived content. After analyzing SharePoint's native features, we will identify best practices and available solutions for ensuring a reliable, scalable SharePoint platform.
