## Title: From Tech to Lead - Transitioning from a Technician to a Leader
## Abstract:
### Many people want to be a manager; however, most folks believe that their company will guide them or provide the opportunity for that next big step.  That is not the case!   You have to take your career into your own hands, take additional responsibilities, be more vocal, add more skills, and discuss your career desires with your supervisor and HR.

You got the manager role, now what?  The transition from a team member to a manager can be a rough road.  Just because you’re the manager now, doesn’t mean people will listen to you.  Understanding what it takes to become a Leader, not a manager, will be the difference between success and failure!


This presentation will share some successful practices on how to successfully transition from Technician to a Leader.
