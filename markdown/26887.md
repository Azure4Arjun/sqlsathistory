## Title: Backup and Recovery Basics
## Abstract:
### As a DBA, two of your most important responsibilities are backing up data and knowing how to recover it. In this presentation, we’ll talk about backup types, recovery models and recovery point objectives. I’ll demonstrate backing up data and recovering it to a point in time. By the end of the session, you’ll know what a copy-only backup is, when to take a tail-log backup and what it means to restore a database with no recovery.
