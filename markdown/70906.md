## Speaker: Erik Darling
## Title: Query Optimization Explained in 15 Demos
## Abstract:
### You've got the hang of writing queries and creating indexes, but once you hit F5 you have no idea what's going to happen. 

* Why did I get that plan? 
* Why didn't you use that index?
* Why are you slow?

In this session, we'll look a little deeper into query optimization, and why SQL Server makes the choices it does. 

This will be fast-paced, demo-heavy and slide-light.
