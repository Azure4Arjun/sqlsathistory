## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: SAN Basics for DBAs
## Abstract:
### Storage Area Networks are like a bad black box: we put data in, we get data out, but we have no idea what's going on inside.  Why is everything so slow and yet so expensive?  Is it a SAN problem or a SQL problem?  Learn what's happening inside the black box from Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master and former SAN administrator, who will demystify storage.
