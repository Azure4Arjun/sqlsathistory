## Title: Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Performance is one of the most important parts of a healthy database system, but sometimes a query performance may suffer, for a variety of reasons. In one case we may find a reason and fix it easily, while in the other case, it is much harder.

SQL Server 2017 introduced a new approach for solving performance problems called Adaptive Query Processing. SQL Server 2019 evolves those mechanisms and the entire feature family now is named â€“ Intelligent Query Processing.

The Intelligent query processing in SQL Server 2019 includes the following:
- Adaptive Query Processing enhancements
- Table Variable Deferred Compilation
- Approximate Query Processing
- Scalar UDF Inlining

In this session we will see how do these features work and in what cases they might be helpful.
