## Title: Extracting information from your unstructured data with Azure Cognitive Search
## Abstract:
### AI enrichment is a capability of Azure Cognitive Search indexing that is used to extract latent information from images, blobs, and other unstructured, non-text data sources - enriching the content to make it more searchable in an index or knowledge store. 

Both extraction and enrichment tasks  are implemented through cognitive skills such as natural language processing and image processing skills with several possibilities: Entity recognition, language detection, sentiment detection, OCR, face detection...

In this session, the Azure Cognitive Search service will be explored and described. Then, an enrichment pipeline capable of extracting information from images and documents (PDF, Word) will be built in order to demonstrate a use case scenario, along with requirements, costs, related Azure services and a website/mobile app that allows users to look for information from the files.
