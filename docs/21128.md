## Title: Best Practices for Upgrading to SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### When Microsoftâ€™s own IT department was looking to upgrade to SQL Server 2014, the team faced a variety of challenges, including overcoming some limitations in AlwaysOn. The primary concern was to avoid the application rewrites necessary to take advantage of the scaled out solution. This presentation will detail the steps the team supporting answers.microsoft.com took to streamline and accelerate the project. Specifically, it will discuss how Microsoft enabled auto failover across data centers while avoiding app errors during failover, achieved automatic read/write split, delivered geo-aware load balancing, enabled zero-downtime maintenance, and supported 8x the original traffic capacity of the deployment.
