## Title: Architecture of modern data warehouse
## Abstract:
### The modern DWH brings together all kinds of data, at any scale, without much effort and time, to get insight through operational reports, analytical dashboards, and advanced analytics for all users.
Microsoft Azure provides a set of fully managed services, which allow you to build modern DWH in a few minutes. All Azure services support a fully cloud based solution, or a mix of cloud and on-premise based solutions, to meet the business need. A modern Data Warehouse can be designed to meet business need and accommodate change in data behavior using the latest technology components such as cloud based scalable data storage for big data, real time analytics, predictive analysis and machine learning, global distribution of data, high availability, etc.
