## Title: What's in a Date? Avoiding confusion with Dates, Times, and Durations
## Abstract:
### Dates and Times can be very confusing. Julian Days, Fiscal Years  Months, UTC, Atomic Time, Leap Seconds, ISO 8601, and more clutter up what, on the surface, appears to be a simple set of data types. This session will work to demystify dates and times, with a focus on SQL Server. It will cover the pros and cons of each of SQL Server's date/time data types, why you need a Calendar table in almost every database (and maybe a Time table too),  various good methods of handling intervals and durations, how to use the IANA tzdata database to help with time zones  daylight savings. As a bonus, if we have time, we'll also talk about SQL Server 2016's Temporal tables and what they mean for the current/history table pattern.
