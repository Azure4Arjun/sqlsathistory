## Title: New Storage Paradigms for SQL Server Deployments
## Abstract:
### The storage landscape has changed over the past few years. Whether you are still deploying physical servers, virtual machines, or using the public cloud, each has new ways to present storage for SQL Server deployments. Scale Out File Server, Storage Spaces Direct, VSAN, CSV, RDMA/InfiniBand, NVMe, and more are changing how things look on the backend, including network design. The way we approached deploying SQL Server on traditional storage solutions such as SANs often no longer applies. This session will get you caught up on what new storage options you can take advantage of and how to approach architecting your SQL Server solutions in this new, exciting world. Where possible, live demos will be shown.
