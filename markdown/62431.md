## Title: Building Secure Applications in Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### Cloud computing requires new security paradigms that are unfamiliar to many application users, database administrators, and programmers. Consequently, some organizations are hesitant to implement a cloud infrastructure for data management due to perceived security risks. However, much of this concern can be alleviated through a better understanding of the security features built into Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

Azure provides extremely robust security protection at the physical, logical, and data layers of its services and applications, making Azure datacenters among the most secure facilities of their kind in the world. Likewise, Azure SQL Database includes multiple layers of security, with role-based logical data protection and auditing to monitor the security of your data.
