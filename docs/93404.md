## Title: Stuck In the Middle: Collaborating With Multiple Stakeholders
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it – your management and peers have no idea what you’re doing, how much work and time it takes or even what you do as a database professional. Your role is stuck in the middle.  Management is reluctant to prioritize the money to create better equipment and software updates. Developers don’t want you messing with their work.  Both are annoyed when you bother them with a customer problem or when you can’t fix issues instantly. This dynamic triad (you, developers and management) will always have differing views but this diversity of thought can be leveraged to create powerful customer solutions. In this session, you’ll learn simple techniques to build collaboration, mitigate conflict, meet the customer needs and get everyone on the same page.
