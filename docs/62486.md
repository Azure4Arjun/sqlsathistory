## Title: An Introduction to Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### This will be an introduction to the new SQL Server 2016 Always Encryption feature. Unlike Transparent Data Encryption Always Encrypted provides encryption in transit as well as encryption at rest. This will be a survey overview of both the operations and development side of Always Encrypted, but will be mainly operations focused. Considerations for porting existing databases to Always Encrypted will also be discussed.
