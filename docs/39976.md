## Title: SharePoint Enterprise Platforms: Build  Run Lessons Learnt
## Abstract:
### To point and click our way through a SharePoint installation is relatively easy, but will more than likely result in some form of disaster. Join SharePoint expert, Andy Talbot for a detailed discussion on building and running SharePoint platforms fit for enterprise customers.

In this session, Andy will address some of the common challenges that can take some enterprises by surprise, lessons learnt by large organisations, factors that we should have planned for, and common failure points. Attendees will benefit from this discussion regardless of if you are just starting out with your deployment, or youâ€™re already in production. Although this is mainly targeted at the IT PRO audience, key points are made that very relevant to business users too.
