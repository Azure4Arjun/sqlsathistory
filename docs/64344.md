## Title: Lightweight geo-replication for SQL Server using the Azure Service Bus
## Abstract:
### In this session I will provide an overview of the Azure Service Bus and how to use it directly from SQL Server to send messages between multiple SQL Server databases across the globe. Sending messages to a service allows database administrators to replicate data from one database to another, or to multiple databases using a subscription model. This demo introduces a technology called Enzo Unified to allow direct connectivity to the cloud from SQL Server databases.
