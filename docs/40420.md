## Speaker: Theresa Iserman
## Title: Anatomy of an I/O Tuning Exercise
## Abstract:
### Performance troubleshooting doesn't have to be hard, yet getting good at it requires a methodology, practice, and learning a few tools, and a bit about internals.  In this session we'll simulate an I/O bottleneck and walk through the steps required to identify and remediate the problem.  You'll learn how to identify an I/O issue using Wait Stats, Virtual File Stats, and PerfMon.  We'll talk about relevant metrics, how to zero in on a problem, and how a healthy disk I/O subsystem performs.  Youâ€™ll return to the office with a suite of tips and tools that will get you on your way to becoming a Performance Tuning Superstar!
