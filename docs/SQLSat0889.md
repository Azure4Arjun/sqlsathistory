# Comparing Predictive Models from R, Python, SSAS, and Azure ML
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-889)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Data Science  Machine Learning
## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Comparing Predictive Models from R, Python, SSAS, and Azure ML
## Abstract:
### There is a lot of overlapping in Microsoft BI suite. For advanced analytics, like data mining, you can use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), or R, or Python, or Azure ML. The question arises which tool to use. The answer is simple, through another question. Why not all of them? 
In data mining, you typically create multiple predictive models for the same task, and then evaluate them to select the best one. So why wouldn’t you even use different tools for different models? You will learn how to evaluate the predictive models. Then you will see how to bring all of the mining models together and compare them no matter of the source they come from. You will see how you can use SQL Server Integration Services, Excel, and other tools for this task.

## Speaker: Luis Beltran
## Title: Clever data: Building a chatbot from your database
## Abstract:
### The development of Artificial Intelligence is increasingly present in our lives and as time goes by, its presence will grow thanks to the momentum that enterprises are currently providing. 

One of the most engaging AI applications are chatbots, which interact with real-time users in order to assist them to perform a task -such as booking a hotel, answering a question or looking for specific information on the Internet- while simulating that a real human is behind the scene.

Data is knowledge, and the data that has been stored in your Azure SQL database can be used as an input for a bot which assists a company's customers in order to process the information for them and return expected results.

This session will be focused on explaining the actors involved when building a bot capable of obtaining data from your storage, including Azure SQL Database, Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Services). A mobile app built with Xamarin will be used as demo.

## Speaker: Michal Chmelár
## Title: Power BI as a universal analytic tool
## Abstract:
### In Power BI, you can also do other kinds of analyses than just business analytics. In this lecture you’ll see, how you can use Power BI together with cloud services for quick check of facts from freely available data sources, even if they aren’t published in a particularly suitable format. You will also see, how you can quickly analyze unstructured text (e.g. communication with customers). At the end we will take a look at PowerApps, using which you can not only quickly create a new business app in your web browser, but also integrate it in your Power BI reports, so that you can quickly react to results and take action from a single environment. Because Power BI is capable of doing much more than “just” business analyses.

Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 17:15:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Dmitry Pilugin
## Title: Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Performance is one of the most important parts of a healthy database system, but sometimes a query performance may suffer, for a variety of reasons. In one case we may find a reason and fix it easily, while in the other case, it is much harder.

SQL Server 2017 introduced a new approach for solving performance problems called Adaptive Query Processing. SQL Server 2019 evolves those mechanisms and the entire feature family now is named – Intelligent Query Processing.

The Intelligent query processing in SQL Server 2019 includes the following:
- Adaptive Query Processing enhancements
- Table Variable Deferred Compilation
- Approximate Query Processing
- Scalar UDF Inlining

In this session we will see how do these features work and in what cases they might be helpful.

## Speaker: Ivan Donev
## Title: Designing your tabular/PowerBI model for performance and scalability
## Abstract:
### You developed a PowerBI or an Analysis Services Tabular model and you run it on a server with plenty of cores and memory. But your queries does not scale or your users are not happy with the performance! So what can you do? You can fine tune the settings of your AS Tabular (usually does not bring a large benefit), you can scale up (which is costly) or you can apply the techniques I am going to show you in this session. Techniques, that range from optimizing the storage of your model, to how to effectively implement DAX patterns for maximum performance. And all of that, complemented with digging into engine execution plans, DMVs, tracing activity and tabular engine internals.

## Speaker: Nicky van Vroenhoven
## Title: Power BI (Premium) Implementation at a Financial Institute
## Abstract:
### Back to September 2016: Power BI is new, shiny and hot. It is the tool of the moment, so people cannot wait to get their hands on it.
Fast forward 6 months, there is more traction within the business, training is given and workshops are held. The adoption of Power BI is growing. Some departments already use Power BI very extensively and incorporate it in their day-to-day processes. Due to this quick success there is uncertainty regarding the right support team for incidents and problems.
Because an app workspace creates an Office 365 group with a lot of artifacts behind the scenes, the creation workflow is controlled by IT. Unfortunately this inhibits the end users.
We require more governance, not to further bother the users, but it is essential to stay in control. Responsibilities need to be better aligned between IT and the business.
Throughout this session we take you along on our Power BI journey, with tips, tricks, do's and don'ts during the implementation of Power BI (Premium).
