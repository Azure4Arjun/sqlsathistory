## Title: Performance Monitoring with Quest
## Abstract:
### Do you ever get the question "is there something going on with the database?" Does your manager ever ask you "what happened last night?" Does the performance of your database instances keep you awake at night? Do you need to quickly identify and address problems? Are you managing more than just SQL Server? These are just a few of the topics of conversation I've had with organizations over the years. Maybe we can help you answer these questions and more. We'll discuss how Quest's performance monitoring solutions can be used to proactively notify you of problems, to quickly diagnose them, and to dig deeply to uncover their source.
