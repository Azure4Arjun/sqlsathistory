Microsoft offers several options for implementing variety of analytical scenarios:

We will give an overview of these tools and represent the power of combining them all to hack different datasets for hidden insights.
We will share lessons learned by our team from Microsoft Big Data Hackathon with Translink public data. We hope that this session will give a boost for Sql Server developers to put all the power of Microsoft BI tools together and implement advanced and flexible analytical solutions for their customers.
