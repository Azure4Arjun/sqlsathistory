## Title: Monitoring SQL Server, Everywhere, With SQL Sentry
## Abstract:
### Want to get the best out of your SQL Server systems? Then you really ought to monitor them! 

With the rise of Cloud, with hosted virtual machines and Azure SQL DB, adding to the mix of on-premises physical and virtual machines, having one tool that can give you this single view is vital. 

Monitoring enables you to understand where you have pain points and allows you to make the most out of these disparate systems. With SQL Sentry tools we can monitor every type of SQL Server wherever it resides; AWS Virtual Machines, Azure SQL DB, in your Datacenter, or  hosted in Rackspace.
               
Join us as we help you understand what, and how SQL Sentry can help you get the most from your SQL Server Data Platform, wherever it is.
