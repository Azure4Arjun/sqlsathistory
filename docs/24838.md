## Title: The Future of the DBA
## Abstract:
### What will the DBA role look like in 10 years? 20 years? Will a DBA still be necessary? We'll explore a number of scenarios in an open forum as
we try to determine how, as DBA's, we can position ourselve for a bright and productive future. I'll talk about the trends I'm seeing
from companies of all shapes and sizes. This presentation isn't about consensus but about tackling the tough issues facing the
future of our profession.
