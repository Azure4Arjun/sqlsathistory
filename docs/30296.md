## Title: Windows Server 2008 R2 and Hyper-V
## Abstract:
### If you are new to server virtualization, this is the perfect session to get familiar with the components and features of Microsoft’s Hyper-V R2 (Windows Server 2008 R2).  Once we get the basics out of the way, I will walk through some key items in configuring your own Hyper-V environment for testing as well as key factors for using Hyper-V in a production environment.  I will briefly discuss virtualization factors for SQL in preparation for Denny’s session.
