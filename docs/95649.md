## Title: Modern Data Integration  Analytics in the Cloud â€“ From Azure to Snowflake
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll discuss modern data integration and analytics in the cloud. We'll walk through how to create an Azure Data Lake by using Azure Data Factory as our ELT tool. We'll then use Databricks to load our data into Snowflake for better analysis. Finally, we'll connect Power BI to our data. No prior experience will be needed for this session.
