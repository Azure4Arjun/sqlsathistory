## Speaker: Robert Schoedel
## Title: Streamline development with VS build contributors
## Abstract:
### While many teams are now using Visual Studio for database project development, few have begun to take advantage of build contributors.  Build contributors represent a powerful technology that is particularly adept at responding to changes in the database project.  This technology can enable integration scenarios which might otherwise be difficult or time-consuming, such as automatically updating documentation or installation scripts.  In this session, you will understand how build contributors are enabled, and see this technology in action.
