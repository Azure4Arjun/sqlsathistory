## Title: Analysis Services Relational Querying â€“ Why Bother?
## Abstract:
### With Microsoft Analysis Services being one of the most scalable multi-dimensional OLAP tools on the market, the relational OLAP storage method has traditionally not been given much consideration.  With the release of SQL 2012, the Tabular model was introduced and offered lightning fast columnar storage and a direct query option.  Is there a reason to consider, or reconsider, Analysis Services relational querying capability given the current technology landscape?

Data is more valuable when it is timely.  Overnight processing windows are not always available in systems that need intra-day loads or in global systems.   With a good design, relational queries can leverage the constantly improving database technologies including the use of columnar indexes and massively parallel processing (MPP) to provide business value at speed and scale.

This session will review the case for relational querying as well as the behaviors of Analysis Services operating in ROLAP and direct query modes.
