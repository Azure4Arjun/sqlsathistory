## Title: Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.
