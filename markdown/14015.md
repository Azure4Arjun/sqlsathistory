## Title: Shared technical learnings for building highly scalable and available cloud application
## Abstract:
### The Azure CAT team has successfully architected, designed and built over 200 cloud projects. In this session we will share the learnings on how to design a cloud application to scale to handle large, complex workloads. We will have a special focus on the telemetry management and monitoring requirements such large systems require.  Building cloud applications are different than building on premise SQL Server applications. Agenda I) Share some of the existing successful cloud deployment feeds and speeds. II) The challenges we faced III) It is all about the architecture up front IV) Lessons Learned V) Summary QA.
