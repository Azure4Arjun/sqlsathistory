## Title: No DR Site?! No problem!! Enhance your SQL Server HA/DR capabilities using Windows Azure
## Abstract:
### You may already know that Windows Azure cloud service will help you build cost-efficient, scalable and flexible SQL Server solutions. But do you know you can also use it to enhance the High Availability and Disaster Recovery of your SQL Server solutions? In this session, we will show you how you can use the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) capabilities of Windows Azure to build highly scalable and available SQL Servers. We will then take it further to demonstrate how you can use AlwaysOn Availability Groups to improve availability and provide disaster recovery for your SQL Servers either on premise, in the cloud or both (Hybrid). We will also introduce you to the cloud enhancements in SQL Server 2014 that makes deploying databases to Windows Azure and implementing AlwaysON replicas in the cloud merely a child play. We will also look at how Windows Azure Blob Storage provides flexible, reliable off-site storage location for your SQL Server database backups.
