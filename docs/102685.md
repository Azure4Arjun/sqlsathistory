## Speaker: Lisa Bohm
## Title: SARGability: The Case of the Unused Index
## Abstract:
### I just wrote some tSQL code, and made a perfect index!  But wait, it's still slow and it's not being used!  Why not?
We're going to take a look at indexes and how they work, and then do a deeper dive into the ways we write our code that will not allow it to use those wonderful indexes. Participants will come out with a deeper understanding of indexes and yet more coding anti-patterns to avoid!
