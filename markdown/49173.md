## Title: The current state of Powershell DSC for DBAs
## Abstract:
### Powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a declarative configuration management system.
Most DBAs are probably using unattended installs followed by a bunch of post configuration scripts make sure our SQL Server instances are production ready.
We will take a look at how Powershell DSC works, and how this can be used by DBAs to install, configure and manage SQL Servers.
We will try to answer questions like:

How does Powershell DSC work
How would a DBA use Powershell DSC
Are the resources to manage SQL Server mature enough

After this session you are better equiped to decide if Powershell DSC is useful for you, now or in the near future.
