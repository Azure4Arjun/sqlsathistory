## Title: Why Be Normal?
## Abstract:
### Is your database normal?  While being different and off-beat can be good for your personal life it is not a happy situation for your database to live in.  Databases like to be normal!  Join me for a fun and informational session on how to create a normal database and find out why it is important.  We will also talk about how to make a database normal using queries so you can benefit from normalcy without having to go through major psychotherapy.
