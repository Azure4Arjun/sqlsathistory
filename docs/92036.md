## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
## Abstract:
### Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As we move towards distributed cloud architectures we will employ a range of disparate tools, the patterns that were designed for single box solutions may not be appropriate any more.
 
We will first review the patterns and processes that underpin the Lambda architecture, providing advice and guidance on the tool sets and integration points between them.

This intense, demo-packed session implements real-time reporting using the Lambda Architecture in Azure, demonstrating Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, Data Factory, SQL Datawarehouse and Stream Analytics. Time permitting, we will compare and contrast against an alternative pattern using Cosmos DB  Spark Structured Streaming.
