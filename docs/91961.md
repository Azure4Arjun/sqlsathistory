## Title: Execution Plans for Performance Tuning SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### Performance Tuning starts with looking at a plan SQL Server internally uses to execute T-SQL. There are many parts to the plan as well as additional options for performance tuning.  This session will provide real-world examples of T-SQL that can cause execution plans to not be optimal.  The plan might also expose additions in the form of new indexes that can be added to improve performance. 
There are many paths to reading these plans that need to be discussed and probably you will hear 'it depends' in this session. Explanations of why it depends will be used with examples.
