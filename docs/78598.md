## Abstract:
### If you would like to learn about Spatial Data but don’t know where to start, this session is for you. We will begin by focusing on what Spatial Data is through examples and interactive demo’s. The goal is to show how Spatial Data can improve your professional experience and serve as an asset to your business. 

I will introduce you to Spatial Data in the SQL server and show how to import data into SQL Server. We will focus on demonstrations of the SQL Server 2016 and JSON functions used to create geoJSON objects from Spatial Data. Next we will cache these objects by using In-Memory tables with the help of SQL Server 2017.
