# Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#267---Lisbon-2014)
Event Date: 12-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 7 - Free Data
## Speaker: Paul te Braak
## Title: Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data
## Abstract:
### Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.

## Abstract:
### Windows Azure gives you a choice in where to host your SQL data, with both SQL Server running in a VM and Windows Azure SQL database. Ongoing innovations in SQL/VM and SQL DB enable both low overall TCO for management of existing applications/services and an efficient platform for the new breed of cloud applications/services. Additionally the ability to mix and match existing and new applications in the same hosted service, and to integrate with on-premises applications and networks in hybrid models provides tremendous flexibility. This session will take a deep look at the best practices when provisioning and deploying a SQL Server in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine.

## Speaker: Sergey Olontsev
## Title: Analyzing Query Plans Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### Query plan shows how your query is physically executed and without a doubt, it is the best way to analyze most of the performance problems. We will delve into the internals of query plan operators, investigate how they work and where to look into query plan to find any problems.

# 15 Quick Tips for SSIS Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#267---Lisbon-2014)

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: 15 Quick Tips for SSIS Performance
## Abstract:
### When reviewing your ETL processes, the No. 1 question is always, "Does it work as expected?" Closely following that question is the ubiquitous, "How fast does it run?" This session’s tips are targeted at improve the latter.

In this session, we’ll focus on SSIS package performance, quickly reviewing 15 common hotspots for performance issues as well as recommended methods for maximizing throughput. You’ll walk away with some key design patterns and recommendations that you can use today to improve SSIS package performance.

# Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#267---Lisbon-2014)
Event Date: 12-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 3 - Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

# MDX, it is not that hard!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#267---Lisbon-2014)
Event Date: 12-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 7 - Free Data
## Speaker: Peter ter Braake
## Title: MDX, it is not that hard!
## Abstract:
### My first experience with MDX was: good, it looks like SQL: SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE. On my second glance it turned out to be completely different than SQL. But after a while SQL and MDX started to feel similar. In this session I bring you to the point of seeing the similarities instead of the differences. We will use your SQL experience to give you a head start with MDX. The session is also good for those with a bit of experience who want to know a bit more about the background. Of course all theory is backed by demo’s.

## Speaker: Turgay Sahtiyan
## Title: Top 10 Performance Tips for SQL Server Developers
## Abstract:
### Performance of a SQL Server depends on many factors and due to the nature of development SQL Server developers sometimes miss basic performance tips. Easily implemented tips such as using an appropriate index or solving a data mismatch problem on where conditions could affect the application performance significantly. In this session, we will cover the top 10 tips to improve the performance of your SQL Server with real life examples.

# SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP / XTP Management Deep Dive
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#267---Lisbon-2014)

## Speaker: Andreas Wolter
## Title: SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP / XTP Management Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### You have heard about Hekaton, respectively the new Acronym XTP (eXtreme Transactional Processing) and you want to know how it works under the cover? In this session we will take a closer look at the architecture, where the performance benefits come from and how it works in detail. What kind of files is SQL Server using for transactional consistency, what happens when you delete data inside the log and inside the data files. We will see the Merge-Process and the Garbage collector in action, see how memory management works for XTP enabled databases, and thereby get an in-depth understanding of how this completely new storage engine works and how to optimize for it.

Event Date: 12-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 6 - Clustered Data
## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Happy as a Pig in Muck
## Abstract:
### This session will take a look at Pig. Pig is a platform for analysing large datasets using a high level language in Hadoop.  It is easy to use, intuitive and embarrassingly parallel.  It was developed in order to avoid the complexities of Map Reduce. It is useful for ad-hoc analysis and of course ETL.  During this session we will see it being used to manipulate structured and unstructured data.
