## Title: What can SQLCLR do for you?
## Abstract:
### Most articles and blog entries regarding SQLCLR are focused on how to write functions or stored procedures, but very little time is spent on showing what SQLCLR does really well and where it can be truly beneficial. Here we will explore the what / why / when of using SQLCLR to accomplish things that cannot be done in T-SQL, such as: Dynamic SQL, error handling, and calling Stored Procedures within functions; capturing PRINT output; Custom Aggregates; multi-threading; and more. We will look at practical examples of using SQLCLR to reduce code complexity, reduce the time it takes to complete a project, increase performance, and assist in automation (i.e. stay within T-SQL instead of using SSIS or xp_cmdshell).
