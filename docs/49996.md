## Title: A new paradigm for workload analytics in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this session, you will learn how to utilize Foglightâ€™s Performance Investigator to analyze and determine the root causes to SQL Server performance issues created by transaction workload.  We will discuss the new monitoring architecture used as well demonstrate use-cases that allow for forensic-level analysis of real-time and historical data.  Focus areas such as deep-dive lock analysis; comparing workload between time periods and instances; as well as change tracking for database configuration, objects execution plans and system configuration to quickly see the impact on database performance will be showcased during this session.
