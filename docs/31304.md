## Title: Top 10 Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server encompasses a wide variety of domains – administrative, development, and design.  But despite years of experience with relational databases, SQL Server practitioners frequently make the same mistakes over and over again.  Wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?  This session will answer questions like:
-	What’s the most common Transact-SQL programming mistake and how do I fix it?
-	How do database designers cause problems for future generations of application developers and database administrators?
-	Why do inexperienced database administrators make their own job more difficult and less efficient?
