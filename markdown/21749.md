## Title: SQL Server 2012: To NAS or not to NAS, that is the question
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft introduced full support for SMB offering the ability to install SQL Server 2012 with both system and user databases on SMB file shares.  This allows you to build end-to-end NAS solutions with much more flexibility than SAN storage, and enables new scenarios such as volume auto grow and shrink.  In this session we will review the benefits of NAS storage and demystify SMB - and show you how to easily install and configure SQL Server over SMB and VMware NFS on NetApp storage as well as best practices, caveats, and performance.
