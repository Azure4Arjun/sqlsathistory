## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: How do I Get-Started with PowerShell?
## Abstract:
### What’s this thing called PowerShell? Why should I care? And what can it do for me? During this beginner level session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will be covering all of those questions and many more that are all too common among PowerShell noobs such as: How do I figure out what the commands are? And how do I extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server? This session is designed for those people who haven’t yet embraced PowerShell and want to know how to get started. The first beta of PowerShell was released 10 years ago and with it now being part of Microsoft’s common engineering criteria, it’s not going away any time soon so what are you waiting for?
