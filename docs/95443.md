## Title: Azure Databricks in action
## Abstract:
### Databricks is the tool of choice for performing data transformation in Azure. This session gives an overview of Apache Spark and Databricks. We will also perform a non trivial data transformation, publish the resulting data frame to the HIVE metastore, and query it directly from Power BI. Come see what is possible in the Modern Data Platform.
