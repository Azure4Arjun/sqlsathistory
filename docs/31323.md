## Title: Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on
the market. But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy. And it doesn’t mean that
database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since SQL Server is constantly
growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues
that others had tackled and solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails
of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. In
fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?
