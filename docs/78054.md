## Title: Dynamic Data Driven Subscriptions in SSRS Without Enterprise Edition
## Abstract:
### Data Driven reports are a powerful Reporting Services feature, but they are only available in the Enterprise Edition.  In this session we're going to dig into the ReportServer database and look at some tables that will allow us to dynamically interact with subscription records and use them to control report output.
  
We will also leverage an SSRS interface to set and update parameters to the subscription tables.  
By using these techniques we can simulate the power of Data Driven Subscriptions without having to have Enterprise Edition.  These techniques can also be used to dynamically configure actual Data Driven Subscriptions and kick them off without access to the SQL Agent engine.  Anyone wanting to extend their SSRS capabilities in creating report automation should attend this session.
