## Title: Secure your sensitive data with Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### Data security is a major concern for organizations especially when they start to explore cloud-based data options. Microsoft is enhancing security options in almost every major release of SQL Server. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has implemented “Always Encrypted” option which is quite different from previously available options including TDE. It is encryption of data not only at rest, but also in use and in transit. We will have a deep discussion about this new end-to-end data encryption feature which can be implemented without any code change on application side for both on premises and cloud SQL Server databases.
