## Title: Powershell - Automating build and deployment in a datawarehouse environment   
## Abstract:
### There are many components which are developed and integrated as part of the large database solution â€“ databases, ETL packages, reports, roles/security, SharePoint presentment, dashboards, etc.  But the solution also needs to be managed in the context of a robust ALM, many physical environments with varying configurations, and many developers contending for resources.  Automated builds are critical to such a solution.  In this session we will examine the techniques used at one company to leverage PowerShell to drive automated processes to build, deploy, and test a solution in their development, testing, and QA environments.  We will see live demos of the tools involved.
