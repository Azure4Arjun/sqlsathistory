## Title: Let's take PowerBI on an adventure
## Abstract:
### For the past few years I have been collecting data on various adventures. This data takes many forms and is disperse. Some comes from my calendar, while other from a Garmin gps device tracking my data points as I traverse the land, the snow, the water.
Let's collect all this data and present it in a way to compare between years and activities. To relive the adventures and plan for more.
