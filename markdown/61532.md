## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 

Here you’ll learn:
• the most useful regular expression commands
• the appropriate times to use regular expressions
• how to use regular expressions to write code for you 
• how to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.
