## Title: SQL Notebooks In-Depth
## Abstract:
### We're taking a deep dive into SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio and their close relations, including PowerShell notebooks and Jupyter Notebooks. Going beyond the basics, we'll see how to use notebooks for demonstrations, standardized data gathering, and data exploration. We'll also use PowerShell notebooks to manage Azure resources in a predictable and well-documented manner. If time permits, we'll take a look at Azure notebooks, a cloud-first variant for data exploration and management.
