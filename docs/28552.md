## Title: Maximizing Plan Re-use in SQL 2008
## Abstract:
### Lack of plan reuse is one of the biggest performance killers in SQL Server and almost everyone has experienced problems in this area before. We will explore exactly how to determine if this is an issue for you and more importantly, how to address it. See what factors determine if a plan gets reused or not and why. We will cover how to issue calls to the database that guarantee reuse and peak performance.  Understanding this aspect of SQL Server is something every good DBA should be fully aware of and attending this session will get you the insight to get started immediately.
