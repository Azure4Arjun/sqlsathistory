## Speaker: Daniel Maenle
## Title: Lock, Block, and Two Smoking CPUs
## Abstract:
### This is a talk on my own experience rewriting the locking mechanism that my company has used. Migrating from a locking table to using sp_getapplock. The ups and downs that I experienced in the transition.
Also to talk about how this can be a great streamline and better performing approach to gaining locks that could be used by the application or other queries.
