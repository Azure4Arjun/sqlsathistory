## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management
## Abstract:
### As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined. You will have a clear understanding of cache plan problems and how to avoid them.

# Professional Recycling - SSIS Custom Control Flow Components with Visual Studio Community
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-413)
Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Wolfgang Strasser
## Title: Professional Recycling - SSIS Custom Control Flow Components with Visual Studio Community
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are an extensible data-integration platform. If the functionality of stock items do not suffice, the script component is the first point of extensibility. If these custom scripts are used in multiple SSIS packages/projects their handling gets quite cumbersome. For a professional recycling of (script) logic SSIS custom control-flow tasks are an option. With the announcement of Visual Studio Community edition there is no need of a full (and expensive) development environment. This session will cover the required tools, development tips  tricks and best practices for Custom ControlFlow development.

# This is how developers might punish your database

Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Mogens Heller Grabe
## Title: This is how developers might punish your database
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has traditionally been the go-to database for software development teams looking for a way of persisting their data, but the recent NoSQL movement has rendered visible just how limiting the relational model can be - and that may have led people to use other kinds of databases, like key-value stores, document databases, etc.

SQL Server does have some ways of misusing it, though, that you might have  missed! In this session we’ll take a look at three alternative ways of using SQL Server, since we’ll see exactly how your favorite RDBMS can be turned into a document database, a reliable message queue, and an event store in a CQRS architecture.

Participants will get an introduction to all the mentioned concepts, and there will be code examples in C#.

# ( virtual ) SQL on Steroids
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-413)
Event Date: 19-09-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Sponsor
## Speaker: Frank Brix Pedersen
## Title: ( virtual ) SQL on Steroids
## Abstract:
### I/O performance and operational ease of use are key requirements for SQL Server deployments. While virtualization has delivered operational ease of use it has done so at the expense of I/O performance. This has resulted in excessive database tuning or expensive and disruptive infrastructure changes to alleviate the I/O bottlenecks. Database level In-Memory Computing while promising brings with it a slew of challenges including application rewrites. 

What if one could guarantee SQL Server latency would take a vacation as In-Memory performance would be smoking fast without any of the challenges that contemporary approaches incur? In this presentation Frank Brix Pedersen will introduce '( virtual ) SQL on Steroids' as a bullet proof way of providing RAM performance for SQL Server without any side effects, any application rewrites or changes to infrastructure.

## Title: Under Construction - Power BI Development
## Abstract:
### Power BI is the Self-Service BI offering of Microsoft to all Information Workers out there, but hey: Is there anything for the macro geeks and development folks? This session will have a look on anything you can do or should not do with the Power BI offering in the cloud and on your desktop. What's in it if you want to go beyond the self-service experience? Is there more than create your own cool "M" functions? Let's see in this session, including PowerShell or the new REST-API.

## Title: High Performance Statistical Queries
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Database Engine has so many business intelligence improvements that it might become your primary analytical database system. However, in order to get the maximum out of these features, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows some extremely efficient inventive algorithms for the statistical queries. The queries use Window functions, CLR aggregate functions, and other SQL Server capabilities. The session also explains the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries as well.

# End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI

## Speaker: Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI
## Abstract:
### Risk assessment is becoming an integral part of many organizations. In order to do it successfully you need to do it regularly and consistently. You need to register the risk factors, the risks them self, evaluate them and then plan the actions required to mitigate them. Besides the registration you need to have compelling and easy reading reports that help managers quickly find how the assessment is going. The familiar Excel interface helps assessors register the risk factors and risks and then plan the actions. The solutions then uses Power Query to load data into PowerPivot without overwriting and the Power View to report the results. The results can then be monitored in Power BI. 

This method can easily transfer to any other data collection solution such as budgeting or incident registration

## Title: SQL Server Batch Mode and CPU Architectures
## Abstract:
### This session will explain how modern CPU architectures work, illustrate the nuances of in-memory performance using a simple fact to dimension table join which demonstrates that a larger column store index can outperform a smaller one under certain conditions. How batch mode leverages modern CPUs will be described along with the pressure points batch mode places on the CPU, to help illustrate this tooling will be used which goes to a level deeper than that which anything furnished by Windows or SQL Server can provide.

## Speaker: Bob Duffy
## Title: Desigining Complex Tabular Models - A Case Study
## Abstract:
### While building of Tabular Models may be straight forward it rapidly becomes more complex when you steer off-piste and into more complex design pattern such as:
- Many to Many relationships
- Semi-Additive Measures
- Last Ever Non Empty
- Events in Progress
- Versioned Fact Tables
- Almost real time processing requirements
- Huge volume
- Non Star Schema Data Warehouses
- measure explosion and lack of calculated dimensions
- Selecting Hardware

This one hour session will walk through an actual case study of a tabular model and discuss the pain points we encountered on the way, along with solutions and workarounds.

# Shadow prediction: SQL 2014 spatial data types and astronomy well mixed

## Title: Shadow prediction: SQL 2014 spatial data types and astronomy well mixed
## Abstract:
### In the Wind turbine industry it is often desirable to know where a wind turbine casts its shadow as it can case annoyance to neighbours.
This session is supposed to be a more entertaining then practical exercise to combine scarsely used data types in unusual fashion, combined with a bit of astronomy and math, to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbine purely by using SQL2014 Management Studio. 

The calculation of the daily path of a shadow can be seen as a rather complex three-dimensional problem. By turning around the perspective and 'painting' the picture of turbines in the sky this can be decribed as a much simpler two-dimensional problem on a sphere. For this the geography data type will be used and in turn the richness of its functionality demonstrated. Even a sufficient visualisaton is included in SSMS 2014.  Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handeled in SQL and no complex math is needed.
