## Title: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- switching from SSIS to Informatica Cloud as an ETL Tool
## Abstract:
### This talk will give managers and ETL developers a look at the differences between SSIS and Informatica Cloud.  It is an honest assessment of some of the differences (some good, some bad and some ugly) to help them decide which ETL tool might be a good fit for their organization.  It is not overly technical for non-technical management, but does touch some topics of interest for ETL developers on  the real-world loading of data between divergent systems and multiple platforms (Oracle and SQL Server).

The movie “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” is used to characterize the successes and failures during conversion of our ETL.  The following topics are discussed and awarded either a good, a bad or an ugly grade:
User Interface and Off Hour Support
Integration with Control-M
Upserts, Mappings and Stored Procedure Complications
Oracle and SQL Server Back End Data Extracts
Change Data Capture Extracts
Product360 and onward
