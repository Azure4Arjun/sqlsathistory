## Title: Delphix Agile Data Management
## Abstract:
### Delphix is a new tool that is coming to market for SQL Server. This product virtualizes at the database level and makes refreshing and or creating new copies of databases for developers very quick and easy. This tool will save you time and storage. It is an amazing tool. I do not work for Delphix I just believe that this tool is one of the most useful tools that I have seen in a long while. This product also has great ROI as you will see in the session
