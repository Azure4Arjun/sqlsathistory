## Title: How to Model for Power View
## Abstract:
### You can create professional, interactive and visually appealing Power View reports in Excel or SharePoint. The best part is that Power View is so easy to use. However, a report will always only be as good as the content (model) it is based on.

In this session we look at how to design a Power Pivot (or Tabular) model with the Power View author in mind. The session will include how to work with KPIs, images, hierarchies and geo-spatial mapping.
