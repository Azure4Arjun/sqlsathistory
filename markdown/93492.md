## Title: Building your own million dollar SQL Practice
## Abstract:
### Would you like to get to $1m annual revenue in 5 easy steps?
Or, do you simply want to go from barely sustainable to profitable?

In this session I will touch on the 5 steps I considered when building and growing out a SQL Data Platform practice. 
1. Choose a specialty.
- How to decide what to do, and how to make it shine.
2. Pick your partners.
- Why partnering is essential.
- Augmenting your capabilities.
3. Defining services.
- What are the differences between Managed Service and Professional Service.
- How many services to offer.
- How to pick a service and price point.
- How long before you actually make money.
4. Market your offerings.
- Yes, you have to sell, yourself.
- When to give things away for free
- The value of existing customers
5. Build your team.
- You're making it, now you need to manage it
- Bringing on the right people.

I'll also touch on how long it took me to achieve each of these, and how I measure success.
