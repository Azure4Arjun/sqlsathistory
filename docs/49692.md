## Title: PowerShell 201: Debugging, Security, Code Signing, and Remoting
## Abstract:
### So you have a handle on basic PowerShell, and are ready to take the next step into deeper PowerShell. In this session we'll look at four topics critical to taking your PowerShell skills to the next level. 

We'll start with some techniques for debugging the scripts you are developing. Next security will be examined, where you'll see how to properly set security for your environment. Closely associated with security is the topic of code signing, a technique that allows you to further enhance the security in your environment. 

The session will wrap up with a discussion of Remoting, a technique allowing you to execute PowerShell scripts and commands against other machines on your infrastructure.
