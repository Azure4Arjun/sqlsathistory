## Title: Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Using the SQL setup wizard and management studio (SSMS) to install and configure a new SQL server is a time-intensive process.  PowerShell scripts can greatly reduce the time required to complete the process.  They can also ensure build standardization throughout your SQL environment.  In this session we will look at PowerShell scripting, including the basic syntax and commandlets needed to automate the installation and post-install configuration of a SQL Server.
