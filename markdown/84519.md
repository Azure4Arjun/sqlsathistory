## Title: QUEST:Optimize transactional operations and reporting from multiple sources
## Abstract:
### High transactional workload is the norm across most of the database industry. And this trend is set to grow, as the market continues to shift toward database vendor agnostics and hybrid and heterogeneous database platforms. But with high transactional workload often comes unacceptable SQL Server performance.  What if you could optimize transactional operations and reporting, as well as use near real-time data integration and replication for scalability and high availability?
