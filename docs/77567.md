## Title: Right-Size Your Data Files
## Abstract:
### Best practices for SQL Server indicate that when configuring tempdb, we should create multiple files for better performance.  So why is it this is often ignored for user databases, where our data is actually stored?

In this session we'll look into why having multiple files for databases and filegroups is important, even on solid state drives.  Then we'll look into some scripts and tools that will assist us in transforming our databases to be right-sized for performance considerations.
