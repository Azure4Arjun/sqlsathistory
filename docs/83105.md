## Speaker: Jessica Jolly
## Title: Relax! It's just DAX.
## Abstract:
### DAX is the language you use when working in Power BI or Power Query to create calculations using your data. 
At first, it may seem intimidating, but the truth is that if you have been using functions in Excel, you have the basic knowledge to help you get started in DAX.
The first half of this session will introduce basic DAX terminology and concepts. In the second half, participants can use their own laptop and work on a demo data set, creating some beginner DAX statements. 
The experts in DAX say that DAX is an easy language to learn, and a hard language to master. DAX may be easy to learn (although that hasn't been this speaker's experience!), but it is definitely hard to carve out a chunk of time to try out a new skill. This is your chance! At the end of the session, I will also share a list of resources, including books, videos, and blogs for you to continue your journey into DAX.
