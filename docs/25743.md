## Title: Lunch Session  A Day in the Life of a DBA
## Abstract:
### Maybe your job consists of setting up security and dealing with backups. Maybe you're a DBA who supports multiple teams in development, QA, and production. Or maybe your day is spent attending meetings, setting up new servers, designing new apps, supporting old apps, and dealing with the myriad sources of pain that make up the daily life of most DBAs. This entertaining lunch-time session explains how Red Gate's tools can take the pain out of the difficult, time-consuming tasks you face each day.
