## Title: True tales of “small-shop” web analytics data with SQL and SSAS
## Abstract:
### It doesn’t take a big company to make big data!  Web analytics data can come from many sources and be very unruly, and the web world is full of people who want insights at their fingertips.  However, a 40 person company doesn’t have the resources for a large team of technical analysts.  This is a case study on maximum insights with a relatively small number of technical people – maybe only one! We’ll walk through taking multiple sources of data (some with millions of rows daily) and converting them into a usable source of insights for the non-technical user.
