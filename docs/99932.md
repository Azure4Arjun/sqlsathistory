## Title: Enabling Cloud Analytics with Azure Data Platform
## Abstract:
### Traditional DW solutions pre-date the cloud. They were designed to run on small, static clusters of well-behaved machines, making them a poor architectural fit. Ð¡loud drives innovation. 

Organizations are moving away from on-premise analytics towards shared data centers and software-as-a-service solutions hosted by platform providers such as Microsoft Azure.

The shared infrastructure of the cloud promises increased economies of scale, extreme scalability and availability, and a pay-as-you-go cost model that adapts to unpredictable usage demands. 

Unfortunately, these advantages can only be captured if the software itself is able to scale elastically over the pool of commodity resources that is the cloud. 

This talk will cover the journey towards Modern Cloud Analytics Solutions with Microsoft Azure. 

This talk will help you understand the potential of Azure Cloud Analytics and learn about our use case and save time for future projects.
