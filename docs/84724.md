## Title: Creating Near Real Time ETLs Using Serverless Architecture
## Abstract:
### Demand for up to the minute data has increased as businesses leverage their reporting to make decisions based on current conditions. This requires a different type of ETL architecture that can consume individual events as they occur instead of bulk processing.

Azure offers several services to fill this need, to the point where the sheer number and variety of them can become confusing. We’ll take a look at these different options individually as well as how they can fit together to create flexible, scalable stream of data.

The focus will be on Azure’s serverless offerings, but other PaaS services will be discussed where they may interact with a serverless design.
