## Title: Introduction to Polybase
## Abstract:
### Polybase started as a technology which allows you to query data stored in Hadoop or Azure Blob Storage as if it were just another table within SQL Server. In SQL 'Aris' (2019), Polybase will grow further and add additional connectivity and querying potential.  

Come to this Beginner talk to learn how you can get started using Polybase in SQL Server right away, and learn about the 3 core EXTERNAL objects used in Polybase.  We will compare and contrast the differences and similarities between Polybase and Linked Servers.
