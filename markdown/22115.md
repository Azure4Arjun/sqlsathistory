## Title: Disaster Recovery for SQL Server Applications using Azure Site Recovery
## Abstract:
### The demands for compliance reporting, failover testing, RPO’s and RTO’s in the seconds range, with high performance workloads are all challenges.  Getting the SQL data to the remote site is usually the easiest piece of the puzzle.  What about everything else that is necessary to have a working application.  In 2014, Microsoft released Azure Site Recovery, a cloud based disaster recovery control plane enabling orchestrated failover of virtualized workloads leveraging the replication capability  on many of the leading storage array products.  This combination of virtualized SQL Server applications, cloud orchestration, and high performance storage replication delivers low RPO’s and RTO’s for consistent multi-server distributed SQL Server applications recovery.  Topics covered will include solution architecture, recovery plans, failover testing, failback, audit reporting and compliance using Azure Site Recovery, Hyper-V, and storage array replication.
