## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Why candidates fail the job interview in the first minute
## Abstract:
### In the last two decades I always had more open positions than I could fill, not because of lack of applicants, I must have interviewed close to 300 people for DBA, database developer, data architect, data modeling and other data related positions. Come to this highly interactive session to learn why 99% of the candidates failed the simplest questions and disqualified them self.

Thomas will share what he misses in resumes and how to respond to questions better.
