## Title: Recursive Queries: Beautiful Events Always Recur 
## Abstract:
### (Eng  Afrikaans)
Within the realm of financial instruments, business structure and rules are highly hierarchical in nature. Investor funds consist of one or many levels of asset IDâ€™s which in turn are comprised of one or more lots. This certainly poses interesting challenges when it comes to creating efficient and effective detailed and summary level queries and reports. This beginners' to intermediate level hands-on presentations is aimed at showing the attendee how we handle recursive scenarios,utilizing several techniques including, recursive T-SQL, code using memory TABLEs (as custom stacks) and CTE's.
