## Abstract:
### Abstract - Logical Data Warehousing with Tableau 10

Logical Data Warehousing has become a trending BI topic. The purpose of an LDW is to extend a traditional Data Warehouse with supplemental information, and is even being used to reduce development time by supplanting  the traditional data warehouse altogether.

Many tools are now available that will help in the creation of an LDW. The latest version of Tableau provides tools for combining data from disparate sources into a unified data source that is consumable by end users.

Learn about LDW, and learn how Tableau 10 can help provide value to your client in less time than with a classic data warehouse solution.
