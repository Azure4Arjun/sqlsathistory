## Title: DB Options on Azure – Which One Should I Use?
## Abstract:
### So many ways to handle database information on Azure: Table Storage, NoSQL, CosmosDB, SQL as VM’s, multiple flavors of SQL-as-a-service, open-source SQL-as-a-service, data lake, Azure Data Warehouse, etc. How and why should I choose one (or a particular combination) over the others? What’s so special about each one?
