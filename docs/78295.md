First, a temporal table is a type of table where the current version of the data is stored in the temporal table while previous versions of the data are stored in an associated “history” table. Together, the temporal table and its related history table store a full history of the data as it changes over time. Second, the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause is available in SELECT … FROM constructs for querying temporal tables at either a precise moment in time or during a specific period of time with one of four sub-clauses: AS OF, FROM TO, BETWEEN AND, and CONTAINED IN (,). In this presentation, the schema of a temporal table and its corresponding history table will be explored to gain an understanding of how SQL Server stores temporal data. This will be followed with queries demonstrating how and when to us
