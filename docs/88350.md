## Speaker: Dave Dustin
## Title: Beyond Devops - Introducing Data Reliability Engineering
## Abstract:
### Today’s database professionals must be engineers, not just administrators. We build things. We create things. As engineers practicing devops, we are all in this together, and nothing is someone else’s problem. As engineers, we apply repeatable processes, established knowledge, and expert judgment to design, build, and operate production data stores and the data structures within. As database reliability engineers, we must take the operational principles and the depth of database expertise that we possess one step further.

Guiding Principles of the DBRE
* Protect the Data
* Self-Service for Scale
* Elimination of Toil
* Databases Are Not Special Snowflakes
* Eliminate the Barriers Between Software and Operations
