## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: SQL 2012 Empowers SharePoint BI
## Abstract:
### I will bring to life how SQL 2012 empowers the BI of SharePoint BI.  Meaning...what parts of SQL yield what parts of SharePoint BI.  Where are the SQL parts, where can you see and manage them?  How does the consumer see them.  How can you tell what the consumer is seeing?  What tools are used to build what parts of SharePoint BI?  Real-life examples of how SharePoint BI is implemented in the City of Jacksonville will be used as examples.
