## Title: ORM Tuning From A Database Perspective
## Abstract:
### Most ORM's tend to be very chatty and generate complex queries. Which is not a bad thing most of the time, but sometimes it get's out of hand and the queries will either be too complex or, and this I see the most, there will be way to many queries to answer relatively simple questions. Seeing thousands of queries for a simple webpage is not uncommon.

In this session we will look at optimising database access in ORM's. Using Nhibernate, LINQ  Entity Framework in the demos, we will examine how your ORM talks to the database and why.

We will look at this problem from 2 sides. As a developer who would like to tweak and tune as little as possible and let the ORM do it's magic, and as a DBA who would like all queries to ask only for the data that you need to have at that time. Using a lot of demo's we will be looking at typical ORM features like Lazy Loading, Mapping, Caching, Inverse Relationships, etc. 

We will conclude with some best practices and lessons learned.
