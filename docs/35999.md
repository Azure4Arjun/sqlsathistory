## Title: Automated Enterprise-wide SQL Server Auditing
## Abstract:
### Do you have many SQL instances in your enterprise?  Do you have to maintain multiple dev/test/uat/pre-prod/prod environments?  Need to spin up new instances often?  Do you need a way to ensure these environments are all set up correctly and consistently and be notified of changes to them?  If so, you need an enterprise-wide auditing system!  I will be presenting my free system that does the following: 1) Collects information an all of your SQL instances daily, 2) sends you a report of any changes that have occurred (new/old/changed values), 3) lets you set up rules for all/some of servers and checks these rules on a daily basis (ie - backup compression should be turned on, Max memory should be less than 2TB, etc) and will even send you the SQL to fix any rules that failed.
