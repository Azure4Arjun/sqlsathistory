## Title: Siena calling! Project Siena a RBID App?
## Abstract:
### With Project Siena Microsoft has introduced a beta release of a new technology for business experts, business analysts, consultants, and other app imagineers. This session will review if Siena is useful for Business analysts. We will show how to combine simple app development (Rapid R Business Intelligence BI Development D) with different data sources from Excel Sheets (Power Query driven) , RSS Feeds, SharePoint Lists or Windows Azure Tables and how to deploy your little app in minutes. We will discuss the use cases of Siena from a BI perspective, what you can do already and what is missing.
