## Title: Social Intelligence at Work: What it is, Why it Matters, and How to Improve it
## Abstract:
### Do you or someone you work with demonstrate challenges in their social intelligence and social communication skills? Is this impacting their job performance and/or ability to effectively participate as a member of a team? For many people, “social” does not come naturally and has to be explicitly taught. In this presentation, you will learn how the social mind works and what the core challenges are of people exhibiting social difficulties.  We will explore behaviors that may directly affect career advancement as well as discuss evidence-based strategies to improve social competency skills.
