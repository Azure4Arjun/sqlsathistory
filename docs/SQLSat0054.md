# How to decide if your database is a good candidate
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 200 
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: How to decide if your database is a good candidate
## Abstract:
### We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.  How to determine it your SQL Server database is a good candidate for virtualization.

## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: SQL Server Clustering 101
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover the basics and delve into the advanced techniques which can be used to cluster Windows servers using the Windows Cluster Service, what sort of protection this provides you, and how to properly set up your clusters for a rock solid environment which will last you for many years to come.  We will start with planning our cluster configuration, selecting our software, and walk through the process of clustering two servers together into an active passive cluster.  We will cover the differences between a standalone machine and clusters with regard to licensing and multiple instance configurations.

# Storage for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 200 
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage for the DBA
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Speaker: Nicholas Cain
## Title: Backup  Restore Basics
## Abstract:
### The key to being able to recover data in an emergency is to have a good backup and to know how to restore that backup to get up and running again as quickly as possible. In this session we'll talk about how to design a backup and restore strategy that's a good fit for you, including discussion around the types of backups that can be taken. We will also work through a couple of demos showing backup and restore in action. After all a backup is only good if you can restore it.

## Title: Be safe out there: Ship those logs
## Abstract:
### What happens if your hardware fails or your data center loses power? Do you have a Disaster Recovery (DR) plan in place that you can implement quickly? Log shipping allows you to keep copies of your databases closely synced and ready to come online in an emergency. Log shipping also offers options for read-only warm standby databases to reduce load from your production servers, adding additional value to your investment. In this session we'll Log Shipping, how it works, and how it differs from its cousin, Mirroring. We'll discuss practical uses for Log Shipping and work through a demonstration to show you how you can get it up and running in your environment.

# Become a Bilingual DBA!  Oracle for the SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 200 
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Become a Bilingual DBA!  Oracle for the SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources.  As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over.  At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms.  Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server.  In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology.  We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Title: What's in your Toolbox? 
## Abstract:
### Over the last 3 versions of SQL Server, Microsoft has included a variety of tools which make managing and monitoring SQL Server much easier.  Policy Based Management, the Management Data Warehouse, Central Management Servers, and Utility Control Points all make a DBA's job much easier, particularly if you are responsbile for a large number of instances.  In this session, we will review each of these tools and how they can be implemented in an integrated fashion to provide an enterprise view of your database ecosystem.

## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Database Switch
## Abstract:
### If you maintain a Hot/Warm/DR solution, you may need to switch between these, from time to time.  Ensuring that your systems are in sync and ready to be failed over too, at a moment’s notice is imperative.  Performing this task on your own time scale will assist with practicing the steps necessary inside the database, as well as outside the database.  A lot of moving parts are involved in a DB Switch.  Let’s discuss what you as a data professional can do to assist in this endeavor.

# SQL Server Profiler and Tracing, a “How To”
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 209 
## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: SQL Server Profiler and Tracing, a “How To”
## Abstract:
### We have all needed to know what is happening in our database systems.  We have often been tasked with finding poor performing queries.  Maybe we are being hit with Auditing and Compliance needs.  All these and many more issues can be resolved with SQL Server Profiler. Maybe with SQL Server Trace.  But which one, and when?
Auditing databases can be tiresome, but a good trace and supporting reports can really help out.
This presentation will show you some of my own ideas, along with others' ideas on best uses for Profiler and Trace.
Once armed with this knowledge, you should be able to take it back to your shops and implement systems that assist you track down these issues more easily.

# Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 209 
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Many-to-Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Cube 
## Abstract:
### Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, we look at a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services many-to-many scenario.

# Getting Started with MDX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#54-Salt-Lake-City-2010)
Event Date: 23-10-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 206
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
