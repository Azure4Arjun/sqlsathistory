## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database - your cloud database and why you need it
## Abstract:
### This session will take an exploratory look at Microsoft's cloud-based relational database offering. We'll lift the hood and look at its many benefits and features, and how it easily fills the need for a highly available and scalable database service in the cloud. We'll discuss how the database formally known as SQL Azure helps ease provisioning and deployment, and how Microsoft takes care of the physical administration so that developers and DBA's alike can focus on the aspects of their job they really care about.
