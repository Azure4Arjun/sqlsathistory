## Title: Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Failing to deliver a well-designed Power BI Report is perhaps the most common reporting pitfall.  What good is quality data if it is not presented in a way that is meaningful or easily understood? Someone without any prior knowledge should be able to quickly understand a report without explanation and be quickly drawn to the key elements you want them to view.  This talk will walk through many elements of bad report design. Learn about visual cues and how certain chart types can convey data more accurately than others. Also, learn about the basic dos and donâ€™ts of report design and layout, using easy-to-learn techniques that bring data to life.
