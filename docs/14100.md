## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
## Abstract:
### Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. Attend this session and you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.
