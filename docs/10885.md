## Title: SQL 2012 Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun.
