## Speaker: Allen Smith
## Title: Beyond Basics in SSRS
## Abstract:
### Learn about working with SSAS cube data in SSRS.  Excel users appreciate the 'Drill Down' functionality so in this session we mimic that experience in an SSRS report.  We also look at custom formatting options available using member properties from MDX queries.   Don't be afraid of a little MDX, no experience necessary for this session.
