Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Alan Faulkner
## Title: SSAS Multidimensional vs. SSAS Tabular – Which one do I use?
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012, we were introduced to two possible options when it came to Analysis Services.  This ultimately presented a question…”Which one do I use SSAS multidimensional or SSAS tabular”?  

Determining whether multidimensional or tabular is the optimum solution for your organization is a key step when working with SQL Server Analysis Services 2012/2014. This session will introduce you to some of the common pitfalls with each solution and how you can avoid them. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clearer understanding of the strengths and weakness of each model and how your organization can optimally leverage the strengths of SSAS 2012/2014.

# Why should I care about the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-478)
Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.

## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
## Abstract:
### Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

# Testing SSIS Packages
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-478)
Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Power BI is Awesome!
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has changed its Business Intelligence strategy in the last few years from an IT centric approach with SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services to an end-user ad-hoc approach with Power BI. Initially the Power BI tools were all separate add-ons to Excel 2010+ that you had to know where to get them and install/activate them individually. Now with new Power BI product announcements and Power BI Desktop, the full vision of these once separate tools is becoming more clear and cohesive as an end-user ad-hoc analysis and reporting tool. In this demo heavy session you will see how Power BI is now a much more complete solution and how it can change how you deliver analysis and reporting to anyone in your company. Demos will include using Power BI Desktop to pull in data from multiple sources and repeatable transformations to clean usable data and build interactive reports and dashboards.

## Speaker: Todd Kleinhans
## Title: Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Always Encrypted. This feature allows data to stay encrypted 100% of the time in transit to and from the server, can keep it encrypted at rest, and offloads the encrypt/decrypt operations off the server to be handled exclusively by the client. Always Encrypted can also be used with whole database encryption (TDE). In this presentation we will talk about what Always Encrypted is, how it is different from the encryption options currently available, and how database administrators can even be prevented from seeing the data! Demos will be done in both SQL Management Studio and in Visual Studio 2015.

## Speaker: Mike Byrd
## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign Keys are the ultimate Catch-22; you need them for data integrity, but they just kill insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Keys and how they maintain data integrity.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling.  You will also learn the possible effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will also examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demo'ed with many script examples.
After attending this session you will 
1.	Comprehend the pro and cons of Foreign Keys in a real world production environment
2.	Understand the consequences of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification
3.	Be able to better assess best approach for Foreign Key maintenance

Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Andre DuBois
## Title: 15  Things to ensure survivability of your database
## Abstract:
### Survivability of data should be the #1 priority for any database administrator. Corruption can happen to any database at any time. How soon corruption is detected and a quick response is key to minimize lost data and recovery in a timely manner. Have a plan ready when it happens, as this is one time you don’t want to “learn on the job”. In addition to daily and monthly maintenance that should be performed, other topics discussed will include e-mail notification when data becomes corrupt and Service Level Agreements.

# Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-478)
Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Speaker: Thane Schaffer
## Title: Critical Path SQL
## Abstract:
### Critical path SQL will focus on recursive common table expressions (and other proprietary approaches, if time permits) on problem solving in finding minimum and maximums for common business problems like minimum/maximum manufacturing costs and leadtimes in BOM's and other hierarchical data structures where a tree traversal would be needed. AdventureWorks will be the primary database for demonstration purposes.

# Overcoming Chartaphobia And Moving Toward Enlightening Data Viz
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-478)
Event Date: 20-02-2016 - Session time: 16:20:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Meagan Longoria
## Title: Overcoming Chartaphobia And Moving Toward Enlightening Data Viz
## Abstract:
### Do your organization's reports consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. You should optimize your data viz just as you optimize your databases. Reports are a user interface that must be purposefully designed to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions. In this session, we'll review requirements gathering and data viz best practices and apply those concepts to the use of Microsoft reporting tools such as Excel, Power View, and Reporting Services. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring, unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports.
