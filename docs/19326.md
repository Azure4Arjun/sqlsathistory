### Are you confused (and concerned) by all the talk about noSQL solutions? Are you uncertain as to whether a noSQL solution is right for your project? If using noSQL, do you know which 'flavor' to use, i.e. Graph, Key-Volume, Column or other some type? Join me to understand the noSQL landscape. Presentation includes info about cloud-based storage from all of the big vendors, i.e. Amazon, Google, Microsoft. The talk also includes info about Hadoop and other open source databases, such as MongoDB.
