## Title: SQL Server 2016 - New Security Features
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is the latest version of the data platform from Microsoft (currently in public preview). Per Microsoft, “It is the biggest leap forward in Microsoft's data platform history with real-time operational analytics, rich visualizations on mobile devices, built-in advanced analytics, new advanced security technology, and new hybrid cloud scenarios.”
There’s a ton of ground to cover on all of the new enhancements, so this session will focus on some of the new advanced security offerings that Microsoft has incorporated into the platform: Dynamic Data Masking, Row-Level Security, and Always Encrypted.
