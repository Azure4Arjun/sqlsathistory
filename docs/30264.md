## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Gathering and Interpreting Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### To begin tuning your system and the queries that run on it, you must begin from a position of knowledge. The knowledge I’m talking about is knowing what is occurring on your systems. What kind of load is the server under? How many times is that stored procedure called? This session will present the basics of gathering and interpreting knowledge about your server and the queries running on it. We’ll cover a variety of topics from performance monitor, to server-side traces, to dynamic management objects. We’ll go over how to set these things up to monitor your system and how to interpret the data returned from them. This session is part of a full day of training which will be presented in May at SQL Rally in Florida.
