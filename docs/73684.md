## Title: Killing Cursors
## Abstract:
### Youâ€™ve been around long enough to pick up on the disdain that the T-SQL community has for cursors, but how do you get away from them?  We will take a common business problem and work our way through a few alternative approaches, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches and evaluating the performance of each. CTEs, recursive CTEs, and the OVER AND PARTITION BY clause will be covered.
