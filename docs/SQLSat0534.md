# (PL) Think Mobile! Mobile Reporting with Microsoft Data Platform
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#534-Krakow-2016)
Event Date: 01-10-2016 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Pawel Potasinski
## Title: (PL) Think Mobile! Mobile Reporting with Microsoft Data Platform
## Abstract:
### There are some business users wanting the information to be available at hand, wherever they are. A good example is a board member tracking profitability of his/her company on a favourite iPhone. Microsoft Data Platform allows BI developers to build reports and dashboards that can be delivered to the most popular mobile devices in the world (iPhone, iPad, Android devices, Windows devices). The purpose of this session will be to show up the capabilities (but also some caveats) of mobile reporting solutions built with SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services (ex-Datazen) and Power BI.

# (EN) Demystifying clustered indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#534-Krakow-2016)
Event Date: 01-10-2016 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: (EN) Demystifying clustered indexes
## Abstract:
### If you ask an expert about using a clustered index you will ALWAYS hear: Yes, you need a clustered index for your table. Last but not least Microsoft Azure Databases requires clustered indexes. But clustered indexes are not always a good choice for your database solution because of several different reasons. This session will start a debate about genius and madness of clustered indexes in your application.

This session will run several demos which will show in a very clear way why a clustered index isn't the best choice in several workload scenarios. "There's no lunch for free"! Not using clustered indexes will have ONE heavy drawback - this drawback will be demonstrated, too.

The session goal is to make decisions easier for you to use a clustered index or not!

## Speaker: Agnieszka Cieplak
## Title: (PL) Rozwiązywanie problemów i optym. SQL Server przy użyciu Data Collect
## Abstract:
### Data Collection nie jest nowym rozwiązaniem. Możliwość zbudowania hurtowni danych zbierających liczniki, parametry i charakterystykę obciążenia SQL Server jest dostępny od wielu lat. Nie wszyscy jednak wiedzą o jego istnieniu, używają, bądź kupują inne produkty firm trzecich, a może byłoby dobrze poznać to co jest w pudełku z SQL Server? W ramach sesji przedstawimy konfigurację, ale też pokażemy jak korzystać i co można znaleźć w raportach tego rozwiązania, by rozwiązywać bieżące problemy, czy dokonywać optymalizacji SQL Server.

Event Date: 01-10-2016 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: André Melancia
## Title: (EN) NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level). 
Disclaimer: No actual state secrets will be revealed. Please do not send agents to my house again.

## Speaker: Cédric Charlier
## Title: (EN) Automating the testing of your BI solutions with NBi
## Abstract:
### If you want to accelerate the testing of your BI solutions, the best strategy is the automation of your tests with the help of a dedicated framework. During this session, we’ll take a look to the features of the open-source framework named “NBi” (www.nbi.io). This framework is providing support for automated tests on the fields of databases, cubes, reports and ETLs, without the need of .Net skills. The demos will show us the best approaches to quickly and effectively assert the quality of BI developments. We'll go a step further, generating the tests by an interesting system of templates and test-cases sources.

## Speaker: Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: (EN) Natural Born Killers, Performance Issues to Avoid
## Abstract:
### Learning SQL is easy, mastering it is hard. In this session you’ll learn simple but effective tricks to design your database objects better and write more optimized code. As an attendee you will gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Ever thought that you were adhering to best practices but still seeing performance problems? You might well be. In this session I will be covering why the optimizer isn’t using all available processors, when the database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used and why the optimizer doesn’t always use the best plan.

You will leave this session with a list of things that you can check for in your environment to improve performance for your users.

## Speaker: Neil Hambly
## Title: (EN) Effective Index Partitioning, Compression Strategy
## Abstract:
### We all know that ‘Indexing’ is KING when it comes to achieving high levels of performance in SQL Server. 
When Indexing also combines 2 of the Enterprise features: Partitioning  Compression, we can often see substantial gains.

Learn how to identify those objects that benefit greatly from being Partitioned or Compressed, OR combining both of these features to even greater effect.

Using Demos to illustrate the performance gains with real-world examples, Take away advanced scripts for use in your own environments.

## Speaker: Bartosz Ratajczyk
## Title: (PL) How minimal logging can help me?
## Abstract:
### You have probably heard something about switching between FULL and BULK LOGGED recovery models and that it#39;s useful for minimally logged operations. But what exactly are these operations? How can you benefit from them and what conditions have to be met? Are there any downsides?

If you want to speed up data loading you should get familiar with minimal logging. In this sessiion I will show you real life examples (and - well - some not real life) how useful can it be, what downsides it has and how it changed over the SQL Server versions.

## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: (EN) Continuous Integration with SSDT and Team Foundation Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is Microsoft developer tools for working with SQL Server databases on premises and in the cloud. It supersedes Management Studio in development functionality. Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the collaboration platform at the core of Microsoft’s application lifecycle management (ALM) solution. TFS gives you the tools you need to effectively manage software development projects throughout the IT lifecycle. In this session, we are going to focus on the interaction between SSDT and TFS. Developing locally and publishing the changes to an on-premises instance of SQL Server. We will look at how we can do continuous integration between development and other environments pushing the schema changes and upgrading the version numbers in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solution. Furthermore we'll look at how to lift the integration to an even greater level by using Microsoft Release Management thus automating the deployment and testing of your software.
