## Title: Test Driven Development with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Test Driven Development, or TDD, is the mainstream in many areas of software development, but what about the database? In this session, we will explore TDD, the benefits of automated testing, and how testing data projects differs from other types of development. Weâ€™ll introduce the tSQLt testing framework and demonstrate its use with a live coding example. Finally, we will discuss some lessons learned in doing TDD with SQL Server.
