## Title: Effective Data Management using Data Compression
## Abstract:
### I present this session @ Red Gate SQL-in-the-City Conference (London - July 2011)This session will explain the basic principles of SQL Server's data compression feature, how it functions, what options you can choose, and how it performs under differing workloads. We will look at how to integrate data compression into your current schema designs and the challenges you will likely encounter, examining the all-important performance aspects and the configuration changes to consider along with SKU editions requirements. We will also look @ Red Gate's "SQL Storage Compress" product to show how their data compression tool can tackle these data growth challenges in a different manner.
