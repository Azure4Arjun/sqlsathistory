## Title: “The different faces of Information: Data Modeling and the Data Profession in the 21st Century”
## Abstract:
### One Data Model fit all cases is not possible- When the only tool you have is a hammer all the problems look like a nail.
From Flat File to Big Data different models have been used each with their own advantage and limitations. Depending on the purpose our models change and change the skills and tools we use.
From manual processing to the digital collection, storage, manipulation, and analysis of data our models have been changed and enriched in order to make sense of the information inside the data, convert it to knowledge and finally gain wisdom in our decisions.
The presentation is an overview of the way we work today with data and how the new perspectives on Data are changing the data profession. In addition to the traditional and new models to work with data, the author introduces two models of his own to explain the “Digital Transformation Hierarchy” and “The Intelligence Life Cycle”.
