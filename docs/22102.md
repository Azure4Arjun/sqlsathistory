## Speaker: Paul Hiles
## Title: The Evils of Cursors 
## Abstract:
### We have all heard that cursors are evil, but most of the time we are not told why they are evil and how to replace them.  The goal of this session is to fix that problem.  We will be reviewing a number of types of cursors and explain why they are being used, why are bad and then show better ways to write them.  This session will include lots of actual scripts and demos comparing these different examples of cursors and then better ways to rewrite the code to replace the cursor.
