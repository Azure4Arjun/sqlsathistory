## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
## Abstract:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.
