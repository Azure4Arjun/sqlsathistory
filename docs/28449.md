## Title: High Availability Solutions in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server 2005 and later version of SQL Server, there are different technologies that are used to server as High Availability Solutions and they can be implemented as Disaster Recovery Solutions.  Many critical systems need to be online 24x7 with very minimum downtime, if possible, without any downtime. To achieve this need, we can implement high availability solutions that are available in SQL Server. Which we want to implement? There are several of them: Replication, Database Mirroring, Log Shipping, Failover Clustering, and Replication.  In this session, we will be talking about these technologies, their usage, advantages, and disadvantages using one over the other.
