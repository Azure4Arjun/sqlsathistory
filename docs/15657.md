## Speaker: James Skipwith
## Title: Database Partitioning - Part II
## Abstract:
### In Session Two:  - And what can be done in Enterprise edition?  - Is it useful for Data warehouses and SSAS Cubes?  - And what’s new in SQL 2014?  Knowledge is power and after these sessions those big tables won’t be so scary anymore. They can be tamed and will soon be purring like a kitten. It’s never all pain-free sailing partitioning large live tables but, armed with the correct knowledge, you can start planning and implementing your partitioning. Sweet.
