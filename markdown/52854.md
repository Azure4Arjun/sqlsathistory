## Title: Performance Pitfalls from Code Reuse
## Abstract:
### Have you ever found yourself deconstructing endless layers of nested code? Is your T-SQL codebase written in an object-oriented format with functions  views?  Did you know that object-oriented code reuse can come at a significant penalty?  

Come to this session and learn why applying object-oriented principles can be extremely detrimental to your T-SQL's performance. You will learn how T-SQL is not like other common programming languages. We will peek inside the Query Optimizer to see how it handles these scenarios. Through extensive demos, we will explore solutions to maximize performance. You will be introduced to a T-SQL tool that will aid you in unraveling nested code. Alternate design patterns will be shown to help you mitigate these performance pitfalls.
