## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: Confessions of a Data Integrator: Bad Designs
## Abstract:
### As database systems become more prevalent, the need to integrate disparate data sources becomes more pressing. DBA’s and developers are often forced to support code they can’t control, and must find ways to support poorly designed relational systems. The purpose of this presentation is to explore some of those challenges and discuss possible solutions using certain "taboo" tools including string parsing, looping, and dynamic SQL. Recommended for experienced T-SQL programmers only.
