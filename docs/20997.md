## Speaker: Judith Moffitt
## Title: Data Meaning
## Abstract:
### Most database SQL training talks about syntax or tools. But the missing element is the most important,  learning what the data means and how you can use that to write better code or to troubleshoot problems.  Sure the meaning is different in every database, but the techniques to learn what the business rules are, what the data actually means to the users, and how to figure out what the column name xfp_reg could possibly mean are the same. Come join me and learn to Query With Meaning.
