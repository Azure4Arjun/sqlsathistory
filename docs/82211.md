## Title: Availability Group Troubleshooting Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### Your Always On Availability Group just failed. Quick! What do you do? Many of us go straight to the SQL Server log and the Availability Group dashboard. That makes sense - both are great troubleshooting tools, and the answer is often found in one of them. However, they don't always have the answer we seek. What then?

As a consultant, I've been able to troubleshoot a number of less-common scenarios first-hand. Join me as we walk through some of these scenarios to show you how to detect and correct them. Along the way, we'll also discuss alerts you can put into place on your servers to give you immediate feedback when something in your availability group goes wrong.
