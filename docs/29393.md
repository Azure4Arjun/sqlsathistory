## Title: The Data Warehouse: Your BI Foundation
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs are thrust into a data warehouse project with little training and no experience, or they are forced to take over the existing Data Warehouse.  Designing or fixing a Data Warehouse model that supports the full range of BI functions can be a challenge for the OLTP DBA.  This session will reveal the essential components that you should put in place for a successful implementation, including concepts such as the Importance of Transformation, Redundancy and why Reuse can be Detrimental, and one of his favorite topics, Ease of Query.  Additionally, the significance of Integration, Metadata, and Governance towards creating a rock-solid, sometimes brilliant, foundation for your Business Intelligence Data Architecture will be presented.
