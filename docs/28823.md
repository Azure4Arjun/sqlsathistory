## Title: Take Control with Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing the resources on their systems in order to ensure that they are being followed and resources are accessible when needed. SQL Server 2008 provides Resource Governor, which allows the DBA to discretely manage system resources in a very structured or not so structured way(Its your choice!). In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features to help lower your anxiety levels while increasing your systemâ€™s availability.
