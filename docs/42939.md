## Title: Performance Matters: Optimizing SSAS Multidimensional Cubes
## Abstract:
### Come and learn tips and tricks for optimizing multidimensional cubes! We'll be covering cube file system storage and the top design considerations for cubes.  Dimension design best practices, optimizing for degenerate dimensions, as well as partitions and aggregations will also be covered. Come join me as we spin through a checklist for MultiD cube design! A foundational knowledge of OLAP design and MultiD cubes will be helpful, but is not required.
