## Title: Don't Use Cursors or Why You Maybe Should Use a Cursor After All
## Abstract:
### You might have heard "don't use cursors, they are slow!". In this presentation, you will learn what actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presenation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.

## Abstract:
### Self-Service Data Preparation aka Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. Traditional approach doesn't work here, data analysts and data scientists have to wait until IT guys gather requirements and prepare a right dataset for them. Time from raw data to insights is too long. In this session, I invite you together look closer at Self-Service Data Prep and show how it would help to get insights and make decisions faster, onboard new data sources without IT, and increase efficiency for data analysts and data scientists.

# Making reports in SSRS: beyond standard tools
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-775)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker: Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: Making reports in SSRS: beyond standard tools
## Abstract:
### Reporting Services is used by years as the main tool to create and delivery reports for SQL Server data platform users.
But although we are accostumed to use it, there are many tips and tricks that can help us to significantly improve the output we produce. For example:
- writing custom function to perform non-standard actions or to create personalized charts
- export multiple sheets in Excel
- dealing with merge cells when exporting in Excel
- using interactive and dynamics filters inside a report
- creating alternate rows backgrounds in tables or matrix
The release of SQL Server 2016 introduced support for R, the most common and powerful analytical and statistical language.
With R inside SQL Server it’s possible to embed R charts straight into Reporting Services, exploiting countless opportunities offered by the powerful graphic libraries shipped into the language.

# Automate your work processes with Microsoft Flow and Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-775)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Hylke Peek
## Title: Automate your work processes with Microsoft Flow and Power BI
## Abstract:
### You use different apps to organize your work. Outlook, Onedrive, Onenote, Sharepoint, Power BI and so on. All for different tasks. Microsoft introduced Flow to let these apps talk to each other. This allows us to create new automated workflows in an easy way. And the beauty is, you don’t need to be a developer!

In these workflows Power BI can play an important role. Power BI generates data alerts which can be used to create emails, work tasks or even start a new flow. Also, you can automatically publish data to Power BI from apps like Outlook and SharePoint to analyze your email and documents.

In this session we’ll introduce Flow and look at use cases to integrate apps with Power BI. By using different demo’s, you will get a good understanding how to use Power BI and Flow to automate new work processes.

# Not just polish – How good code also runs faster
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-775)
Event Date: 15-09-2018 - Session time: 16:10:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Daniel Hutmacher
## Title: Not just polish – How good code also runs faster
## Abstract:
### I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.
