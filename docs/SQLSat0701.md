Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Shannon Lowder
## Title: Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!
## Abstract:
### Automating extract packages is trivial., you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!

## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
## Abstract:
### So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

# SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#701---Cincinnati-2018)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Drew Furgiuele
## Title: SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#701---Cincinnati-2018)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

## Title: SQL Server Security model, in plain English
## Abstract:
### What is the difference between a Login and a User?  What is a schema? Why can I view one table but not another?

If the security portion of SQL Server is confusing to you, you are not alone.  Join me for a short overview of the SQL Server security model, using non-technical terms.  We will look at it from the point of view of something we are all familiar with, so that you will remember it 6 months or a year or more down the road.

This will be a highly interactive session, designed for you to be able to absorb the info without having to take notes.   Bring coffee and learn!

## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Analysis Services for the Absolute Beginner
## Abstract:
### Publications across the globe have called “data the new oil.”  However, the value of oil is what the oil can be turned into.  Similarly, the value in data is in what you derive from it, not the data itself.

## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

## Speaker: Ryan Wade
## Title: R-ternatives in Power BI
## Abstract:
### R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations.

# DevOps for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#701---Cincinnati-2018)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: DevOps for the DBA
## Abstract:
### DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
-What DevOps means to the DBA
-What tools and methodologies are important to know
-The future skills you need to build your career

# Stream Analytics for a SQL Developer
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#701---Cincinnati-2018)
Event Date: 17-03-2018 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Slava Trofimov
## Title: Stream Analytics for a SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### As database developers, we are very familiar with patterns and practices of analyzing data at rest – data that has been loaded into our databases and data warehouses and that allows us to learn what happened a few hours, days or months ago. Yet, we often encounter the need to know and respond to what is happening right now, which requires near-real-time analysis of data in motion.

Fortunately, much of the skillset that we have accumulated in querying data at rest can be applied in querying streaming data with the Azure Stream Analytics service. In this demo-rich session, you will learn the essential architecture and patterns of building streaming analytics solutions and will be introduced to the Stream Analytics Query Language.

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.
