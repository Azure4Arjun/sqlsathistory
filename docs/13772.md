## Title: Node.js on SqlServer
## Abstract:
### We are used to connect to a Sql Server database from our .NET applications with ADO.NET, but today new possibilities are available. Node.js is a new web framework suited for high scalable web applications. Microsoft has released on github the driver to build node.js applications that use SqlServer as a storage. During the session we will see what is node.js and how it can be used with SqlServer.
