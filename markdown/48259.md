## Title: What is Biml?
## Abstract:
### 
You've heard about Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). Some people seem to be doing some pretty impressive things with it, but what exactly is it and will it work for you in your job?

Biml is a programming language for creating data warehouse, business intelligence, and other data solutions. It uses XML in combination with small nuggets of C# or VB code to automatically create huge amounts of SQL scripts, SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and other objects that your team previously had to build manually - usually with slow, tedious, error-prone dragging and dropping. Perhaps the best part is that there is nothing to install on your server - Biml works entirely with your existing data infrastructure.

Want to know more? In this session, you'll find out everything you need to know to get started using Biml.
