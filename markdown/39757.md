## Title: Navision + PowerBI: Manage your business 365, anywhere and everywhere
## Abstract:
### The Systems Manager SME and IT Manager of a large company shared challenges. The main thing is to find management solutions (ERP systems) that provide business value, which integrate well with other company applications and allow users to work without errors or interruptions of service ... and of course: from anywhere and anytime.
Microsoft Dynamics NAV is the strong, agile and flexible solution that allows us to have our company always managed, can be implemented at any stage (in the cloud, hybrid environments, on-premise) and is perfectly integrated with the rest of our infrastructure.
The work of the department goes beyond solving problems and ensure efficient technological infrastructure, and every day is more strategic. A well-integrated, easy and intuitive management solution that enables the automation of processes can bring significant value to your business, saving many repetitive and unrewarding tasks.
