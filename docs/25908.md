## Title: Configuring and Managing FILESTREAM and FileTable
## Abstract:
### FILESTREAM and FileTable offer attractive solutions for applications that need to store large binary data (BLOBs) alongside relational data. With the benefit of the SQL Server storage engine managing the BLOB data but without the downsides of VARBINARY(MAX), FILESTREAM and FileTable have advantages that no other solution offers. This session will demonstrate how to design and create databases with these features. Because the paradigm is different than relational storage, the management aspect of FILESTREAM will also be examined, including transactional integrity, the garbage collector and backup and restore.
