## Speaker: Daniel Rosales
## Title: Aspect Oriented Programming
## Abstract:
### Have you heard of cross-cutting concerns? Do you fret about making the slightest change to your code-base? How does the sound of a new requirement make you feel? If you answered positively to any of the aforementioned questions, you will want to learn about AOP. AOP is a technique for localizing your cross-cutting concerns, such as transactions, security, logging and prevent them from littering what your code was originally intended to handle, namely, your business. Don't let cross-cutting concerns strangle your code base. Come learn about the PostSharp library, a library for the .NET framework that will aid you in keeping your code clear of cross-cutting concerns.
