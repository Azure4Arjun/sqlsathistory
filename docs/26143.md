## Title: Troll Hunting on the Internet
## Abstract:
### The phenomenon of anonymous cyber bullies trolling individuals, as a pack, has increased over the years. One of the things that makes this appealing for the trolls is that they feel that they can act with impunity due to the anonymity provided by many social networks.
In this presentation we'll walk through the development of a theoretical application to identify these trolls, and the multiple accounts they hold, via computational lingustics, before using predictive analytics to suggest likely locations for their homes and places of work/education.
By removing the anonymity of the Internet we can drive these trolls off of social media.
