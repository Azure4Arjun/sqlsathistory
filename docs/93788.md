## Title: Using Dbatools To Automate Database Migrations
## Abstract:
### Migrations can be time consuming and painful. They must be completed with zero down time, and you need to remember databases, logins, agent jobs, linked servers, oh and those random credentials that no one has the password for anymore. If you have faced this situation or are facing migrating from  2008 to 2017 Instances this process can be made easier by using the PowerShell module Dbatools. This session will overview how to get Dbatools, overview of the cmdlets, and demonstrations of migrating from a 2008 instance to 2017. Basic knowledge of PowerShell is encouraged, but not required for this session.
