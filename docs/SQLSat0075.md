# Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
## Abstract:
### How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

## Title: Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

# Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
## Abstract:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be

# Baseline Basics: Where to Start, What You Need
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Baseline Basics: Where to Start, What You Need
## Abstract:
### “The system is slow. It was much faster last week! This is taking forever.” Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs. In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns. We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues. Long-term collection and storage methods for data are reviewed to help you create a plan for building your own repository when you get back to the office on Monday. Tools covered include: Windows

# Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits
## Abstract:
### Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!

## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing
## Abstract:
### Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill performance, including prevention, detection, and resolution of these problems.

## Speaker: Jes Schultz
## Title: Reporting Services 201: From Basic To WOW! 
## Abstract:
### You have mastered the art of linking a dataset to a table in SQL Server Reporting Services. You have solid, reliable reports that you and others depend on. Learn how to take them from basic to "wow", using features such as tablix, lists, images, and charts. At the end of this session, you will be familiar with:
- Report properties such as headers, footers and backgrounds 
- Tablix properties such as ToolTip and NoRows 
- How to build and customize a matrix 
- How to effectively use lists, an often-overlooked feature 
- Adding charts to make reports visually appealing and easy to understand

# Take Your Automation Scripts to the Next Level!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Paul Hiles
## Title: Take Your Automation Scripts to the Next Level!
## Abstract:
### DBA’s traditionally have a library of T-SQL scripts which they use in automating their job.  PowerShell, Microsoft’s newest scripting language, can take those T-SQL scripts to the next level.  PowerShell and the SMO (Server Management Objects) library allow a DBA to create scripts that will interact with the OS and SQL Server at the same time. In this session we reveal the power of automating SQL Server with PowerShell by reviewing a number of scripts that have been migrated from T-SQL to PowerShell.  This session will include scripts that will backup databases, interrogate a server, and script out objects from a database.

# DMVs- What are they and why should a DBA care? 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Paul Hiles
## Title: DMVs- What are they and why should a DBA care? 
## Abstract:
### DMVs - Dynamic Management Views and Functions are the DBA’s looking glass into the internals of SQL Server. They will give a DBA a snapshot on how the database is performing and potential problem areas. In this session, we will review a number of DMVs describing the types of information that can be captures and how it might be used. This review will include index statistics, query performance, memory utilization to name a few.

# PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
## Abstract:
### The paradox of Business Intelligence: it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor. Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us. Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow? In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications). The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :) I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Sarah Barela
## Title: The 4-hour DBA: Automate, Audit and Relax
## Abstract:
### Do you feel that you are overworked and always fighting fires and never can get ahead? In this session, I will help you identify what is important to your job and how to find the time to address those critical tasks.  I will share scripts to automate those tasks that are central to all DBAs and discuss how to establish a methodology to quickly automate daily database chores.  The flip side of automation is auditing.  Routine auditing your server is essential to avoid nasty surprises that can lead to a loss of control.  We will create an auditing system using features within SQL Server, including Policy Based Management and scripts that will provide you peace of mind to enjoy your work and maybe even life beyond the office.

## Speaker: Sarah Barela
## Title: Build your own SQL Server Cloud
## Abstract:
### There is no hotter term right now than cloud computing, however, exactly what this means is a mystery to many. We will begin by defining what cloud computing is and the benefits the technology offers the DBA. You may see the benefits of the cloud, but are not comfortable trusting your sensitive data to this nebulous cloud. The goal of this session is to provide you a blueprint to design and build your own SQL Server cloud, where you can control the server availability and performance reliability, yet still take advantage of the resource elasticity and hardware flexibility of the cloud.  In this session, I will show you how to use features like the resource governor, dynamic management views, policy based management and others to automate yo

## Speaker: Sarah Barela
## Title: Oh, no!  Disaster Strikes
## Abstract:
### No matter how much we prepare, when disaster strikes we all feel a moment of panic. For some that panic quickly passes as we get down to work to fix the problem. For others the panic continues to grow as we search for a solution. Of course back up is crucial, but in this session I will provide useful real world best practices that will show how to recover from disaster and more importantly how to prepare for the inevitable. Specifically how to recover from common disaster scenarios. For example, what to do when the master database is corrupt, a drive array with half your database files fails, a hardware failure, a SQL injection attacks wipes out whole tables and many more.

# Getting Started with MDX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#75---Columbus-2011)
Event Date: 11-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
