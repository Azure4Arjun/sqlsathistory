## Speaker: Brian Knight
## Title: MDX for SQL Programmers
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce the language for accessing data in SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube structures.    SSAS is not just about ad hoc tools and end-user ‘slicing and dicing’ of data.  The speaker will present the basic concepts of MDX including hierarchical navigation functions, sorting and ranking and creation of calculated members.  The session will incorporate demonstration queries using OLAP structures readily available for self-led follow-up training.
