# Usage of R in SQL Server for better data understanding
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#454---Turin-2015)
Event Date: 10-10-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI  Analytics
## Speaker: Tomaž Kaštrun
## Title: Usage of R in SQL Server for better data understanding
## Abstract:
### Language R for Statistical computing is powerful language for data analysis with all great features for data import from SQL environment. Using R with SQL server data will help data scientists and data analysts prepare, explore and validate data much easier, as well as to use wide range of statistics; from uni-variate to multivariate.Session will focus mainly on:1) on connecting R Language with SQL server using standard ODBC connectors and T-SQL procedures. 2) how to validate data with using classical statistical methods on SQL transactional data. 3) how to use R output in SSRS and bring extra information to reports.

# Azure Sql DataWarehouse - The First cloud enterprise solution for MPP
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#454---Turin-2015)
Event Date: 10-10-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: Azure Data Platform
## Speaker: Luca Ferrari
## Title: Azure Sql DataWarehouse - The First cloud enterprise solution for MPP
## Abstract:
### Azure Sql Datawarehouse is the first cloud enterprise solution for Multiple Parallel Process.
But how it works ? Why is it so fast ?
Data warehouses require fixed combinations of storage and compute, often underutilizing expensive resources. With SQL Data Warehouse, data and compute scale independently. You can dynamically deploy, grow, shrink, and even pause compute, taking advantage of best-in-class price/performance. Additionally, SQL Data Warehouse utilizes the power and familiarity of T-SQL to easily integrate query results across relational data in your data warehouse and non-relational data in Azure blob storage.

## Speaker: Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Power BI Architecture
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a cloud service that lets you share, collaborate and access your Excel reports anywhere on any device. In this session, you will learn how to create data models, display visualizations, and synchronize cloud data with on premises data sources. In order to use these new features, you will continue to leverage existing skillsets, such as Tabular, Power Pivot, DAX, and you will be able to connect to database and semantic models you already built, such as existing databases in Analysis Services Multidimensional and Tabular. The goal is to create dashboards leveraging data and models that you have both on cloud and on premises.

# New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#454---Turin-2015)
Event Date: 10-10-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: SQL Server 2016
## Speaker: Gianluca Sartori
## Title: New Security Features in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore the new features introduced with SQL Server 2016 to enhance security. 
Always Encrypted is a new technology that protects your data not only at rest, but also throughout the whole interaction between the application and the database.
Dynamic Data Masking is another interesting feature that allows us to protect sensitive data by masking it to all users that don’t have enough privileges to see the actual contents.
Row Level Security allows showing to end users only the data they’re entitled to access, without changing the applications’ code.
We will demonstrate the use of these three features with example applications and we will explore the use cases where these technologies represent a big leap from previous custom implementations.

## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Analyzing Text with SQL Server, R, and Azure ML
## Abstract:
### Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. Free statistical package / language R is also useful for the text mining tasks. Azure ML is adding additional techniques to the big picture. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with the tools mentioned.

# SQL Server 2016 - Temporal Data Tables (System-Versioned)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#454---Turin-2015)

## Speaker: Kenneth Nielsen
## Title: SQL Server 2016 - Temporal Data Tables (System-Versioned)
## Abstract:
### There are many new features in SQL Server 2016, but the one we will focus on in this session:
•	Temporal Database Tables
One of the many new features in SQL server 2016 is the built-in support for temporal data tables. This is a feature that many developers have been urging to have as a “out of the box feature” – and therefore many have developed their own ways of implementing the capability to store information about how data looked in a certain period of time.
What is a Temporal Data Table?
The concept of a temporal data table is that the table will hold information about a records value in any point in time – thus meaning that we easily can read from the table and get values that are not current, but merely a historical view of the record.
There will be many demo's and script will be shown and shared.

# Visualizing streaming data in real time
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#454---Turin-2015)
Event Date: 10-10-2015 - Session time: 16:15:00 - Track: BI  Analytics
## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Visualizing streaming data in real time
## Abstract:
### We're all familiar with reports or dashboards that show you a static snapshot of the data
that has to be refreshed on an interval. And those are very important visualizations.
But sometimes you just have to have a real time view of your data streams and snapshots aren't enough.
What if you could monitor multiple servers with SQL Trace or Extended Events or had some other source of streaming data and 
be able to see it all happening live on a central monitoring website?
This is a scenario we'll take a detailed look at and build a system for such monitoring.
We'll do this by using Extended Events .Net provider to get the live data stream, 
SignalR to get the live stream from the server to the website and the D3 javaScript library 
for actual real time visualizations on any device.
After seeing all this in action, you'll definitely get a few ideas on where you could use this in your company.

SQL Server 2016, through a new feature called Query Store, let's make these problems easier to fix. Query Store retains all the execution plans used for each query; it captures the performance metrics for each plan over the time and allows you to force an execution plan easily. In this session, you will learn how the Query Store works and how it can help you to fix performance problems.
