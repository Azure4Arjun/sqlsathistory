## Abstract:
### Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

# DBA Repository Update Using SSIS and SSRS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#151-Orlando-2012)
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Reporting
## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: DBA Repository Update Using SSIS and SSRS
## Abstract:
### At its heart, the DBA Repository solution employs SSIS and SSRS to centralize important SQL Server information for the DBA to analyze with ad hoc queries or reports. It was recently updated for performance and resiliency. This session will cover the original solution, published in SQL Server Magazine and his book SQL Server Tacklebox, plus the latest enhancements which will delve into some interesting uses of package variables and MERGE in SSIS. Rodney will also show you how to use the fundamental package contructs so that you can easily expand the freely available project in your own environment. Two additional packages will be demonstrated, Error Log gathering and SSRS audit logs.

# SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables –Clearing The Confusion
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#151-Orlando-2012)
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Cloud
## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables –Clearing The Confusion
## Abstract:
### The Azure platform is quickly gaining momentum and acceptance, in part due to the relational database capabilities of SQL Azure as well as the inexpensive and high-capacity storage capabilities of Azure Tables. Yet, there seems to be some confusion as to why and when you would use SQL Azure vs. Azure Tables. One is relational, and one is not, yet there has been a tendency to use Azure Storage Tables as a replacement for SQL Azure, with poor results. This session will provide a deep look at the difference between SQL Azure and Azure Storage Tables, and show the performance differences when querying each. We will look at how each stores data and the pros and cons of using each as a storage mechanism, and discuss how and why you would choose.
