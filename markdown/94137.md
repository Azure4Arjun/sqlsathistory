## Title: A TCP packet walks into a bar - Connectivity Issues and Bad Jokes
## Abstract:
### Connectivity issues are one of the most common and many times one of the most frustrating issues to deal with, not just a DBA but in any client/server architecture.   We will discuss troubleshooting methodologies and common tools that can be used to isolate, diagnose, and simplify most connectivity issues.   Also, we will look in depth at a few of the more common and perplexing issues going around today.    Finally, to up the excitement level on this thrilling topic, Iâ€™ll mix in a few computer jokes that only a dad mowing his lawn while wearing block socks and sandals would appreciate.
