## Title: How to screw up Database DevOps in 16 simple steps
## Abstract:
### DevOps has revolutionised our ability to deliver customer value.

Updates aren’t held up in 6-month release cycles. We’ve automated tests and deployments collaboratively so we know updates work. A virtuous cycle of innovation and testing allows us to build better, more reliable products faster and cheaper.

However, while that’s great in theory, I’ve seen people screw up spectacularly when applying DevOps to relational databases.

In this cheerful session I’ll review the 16 most popular ways to screw up your ability to deliver database updates, resulting in painful, fragile deployments and expensive legacy databases that no-one likes to maintain.

A session for developers *and* DBAs.
