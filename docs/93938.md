## Title: Be a dynamic SQL dynamo!
## Abstract:
### This session will cover the basics of dynamic SQL; how, why and when you may wish to use it with demos of use cases and scenarios where it can really save the day (trying to perform a search with a variable number of optional search terms, anyone?). We will also cover the performance and security impacts touching on the effect on query plans, index usage and security (SQL injection!) along with some best practices.
