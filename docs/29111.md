## Title: Normalize Metadata for Data Integration Analysis
## Abstract:
### Many of todayâ€™s business applications feature dozens of interfaces feeding a central database.  Interface source-to-target mapping is now common practice, but if there are many interfaces how do you make sure the work of separate teams on tight timelines dovetails smoothly and avoids the all too common death march of correction and rework?
This presentation shows how normalized metadata can help coordinate team efforts, recording data requirements, the target data model, interface sources, source to target mappings, and relationships among analysis components, and enable an effective division of labor that promotes team efficiency, improves planning, and provides the best possible product for developers and testers.
