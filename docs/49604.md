## Title: Contained Database
## Abstract:
### There are times that for one reason or another we will need to move a database from one SQL Server instance to another instance. Before SQL Server 2012 this was a little difficult  because the database relies on data that resides outside the database and we had the extra work to move or restore data that resides outside the database also to the new instance. With the release of SQL Server 2012 Microsoft introduced contained database, this feature allows us to move a database to another instances without the having to move data that resides outside the database, because the contained database had all the necessary settings and metadata.
