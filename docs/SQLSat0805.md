# Working with SQL Managed Data Types
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#805---Bucuresti-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Peter Willmot
## Title: Working with SQL Managed Data Types
## Abstract:
### The Geospatial and Hierarchical managed data types were introduced with SQL 2005 but are sadly seldom used (or understood) by most developers more than a decade later. In this session Peter Willmot will take you on a guided tour of these data types and help you to understand the pros and cons of their inclusion in your database/application design.

# Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Finally, SQL Server with None of the Headaches
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#805---Bucuresti-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sorin Peste
## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Finally, SQL Server with None of the Headaches
## Abstract:
### Ever since Azure SQL Database was released way back in 2010, if you wanted to get SQL Server as cloud managed database service, you had to accept some compromises. SQL Server's cloud-born cousin came with missing features and different ways of doing things, some of them better, others just different, and still others came with specific caveats. But now, with the introduction of Managed Instance, we might have finally found our database holy grail: full-on SQL Server, as a service, with none of the management headaches. Could it really be that simple? Come to this session and find out.

## Speaker: Janusz Rokicki
## Title: The Road to The Autonomous Databases
## Abstract:
### Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure Sql PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.

## Speaker: Catalin Gheorghiu
## Title: “SQL-like” or query languages in Azure IoT
## Abstract:
### If you are reading Azure IoT documentation you will stumble a lot on the “SQL-like query language” or “SQL-like language” syntagms.
In this presentation we will explore Azure IoT places where queries are used and see how to use them. And in the process to find out more about this “SQL-like” languages and how being a DB developer cam make you a IoT hero.
We will concentrate on the scenarios with the greatest impact, where a little SQL can solve you a lot of hassle.
So, we will leave no SQL query unturned  in Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Power Bi to name a few.
