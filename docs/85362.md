## Title: Power BI Deployment:Scaling from 5 to 5000
## Abstract:
### With Power BI, hitting publish is just a click away. But what do you do when you want to share with your team, your company, or the whole world? In this presentation, we cover all of the different ways to deploy and share Power BI reports. We'll start with sharing dashboards and work our way up to newer options like Power BI Premium and Power BI Embedded. By the end of this session, you'll have an idea of the best deployment method for you.
