## Title: High Availability on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you need five 9's of uptime? High Availability of applications and databases are rapidly becoming the "norm" around the globe. It is clearly one of the hottest topics that is important for database administrators, data architects and system architects to fully understand and to plan for. 

This presentation covers assessing, planning, choosing, implementing and administering a high availability solution along with the business justifications of different approaches to achieve high availability (including SQL Clustering, Data Replication, Database Mirroring, and Database Snapshots).
