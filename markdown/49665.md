## Title: SQL Server may let you do it, but it doesn't mean you should.
## Abstract:
### SQL Server comes packed with functionality, options, settings and features. Some of these are old, some brand new. Some features and functionality have been declared deprecated, others might be in the next cut (or maybe should be). This session will cover all the items that I've found or have seen in my research that may not be the best approach at using what SQL Server has to offer.
