## Title: Searching for the Holy Grail of DDL Auditing
## Abstract:
### Who altered this view and how?  When was that index created? What happened to my stored procedure?  From SQL Trace to SQL Audit and everything in between, we'll explore various methods of auditing events in SQL Server, how they work, and the inherent strengths and shortcomings of each in an epic quest to find the perfect DDL audit solution.
