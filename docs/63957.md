## Title: Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Although SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Azure Data Factory (ADF) are both used for ETL/ELT (Extract-Transform-Load) processes in the Microsoft Data Platform, they are rather different tools. SSIS performs data transformation and requires a SQL Agent job or another application to schedule and execute it. Azure Data Factory is an orchestration tool rather than a data transformation tool, and it has built-in scheduling capabilities. I'll explain the basics of Azure Data Factory, show how it is and isn't like SSIS, and share lessons learned from projects I completed that used ADF.
