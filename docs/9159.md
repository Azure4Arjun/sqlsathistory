## Title: Squeezing the Most out of Row  Page Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 brought us the ability to do Row and Page level compression in our databases but even today many people are not taking full advantage of these wonderful features. The most common bottle neck today is physical I/O and SQL Server compression can help with that in most cases. If you are not sure how these features work or how to apply them in your environment this session is for you. We will discuss in detail how the compression schemes work at both the row and page levels along with which data types may or may not be able to participate. We will see from various demos what else affects the compression ratio and just how extensive it can be under the right conditions. Nothing comes for free though so we will also cover the pros and cons along with why, when and most importantly how to use it effectively.
