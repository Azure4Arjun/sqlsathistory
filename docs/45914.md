## Title: From SQL to R and beyond
## Abstract:
### You heard about the “R” language and it’s growing popularity for data analysis. Now you need a walk-through on what is possible analyzing your data? Then this session is for you:

You’ll get a short introduction how R came to be, and what the R ecosystem looks like today. 

Then we will extract sales data from different companies off a Navision ERP database on SQL Server.

Our data will be cleaned, aggregated and enriched in the RStudio environment. We’ll generate different diagrams on-the-fly to gain first insights.

Finally we’ll see how to use the Shiny framework to display our data on a map, interactively changing our criteria, and showing us where the white spots really are.
