## Title: Your AG might not be as “Available” as you think
## Abstract:
### You’ve got an availability group! Good for you! It’s set up all nice and shiny with all the settings configured just right for maximum availability, and the dashboard says “Synchronized.” But wait, did you know someone added a new job to your primary server last week but didn’t add it to your secondary? Or what about the new linked server that was added on your readable secondary to aid with the reports accounting was asking for…did anyone add it to the primary?

An availability group will keep all of your database objects synchronized, but server-level objects are often overlooked. In this session I’ll show you how to set up a reporting tool that will show you which objects are out of sync so that you can correct them, including a query that will let you compare both objects so you can see what’s different.
