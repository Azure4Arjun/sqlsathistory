## Title: Architecting Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### You are a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts. You are considering Always-On Availability Groups and realize that the simplistic setup wizard is a bit, “too easy.” This session will cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of Always-On Availability Groups including their marketable features such as read-only routing and backup off-loading. I will demonstrate how to use the Availability Group Listener correctly and why you should be using Windows Server 2012 or above, along with some of my own personal lessons learned.
