## Title: Understanding the Impact of Flash on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### The concept of storing data on flash chips has been around since the late 80â€™s, but has traditionally been cost prohibitive in most cases.  As the technology continues to improve we are seeing much higher capacities with significantly lower pricing, so the power of flash is no longer limited to just those companies with multi-million dollar technology budgets.  This session will take a vendor-agnostic look at the different patterns for leveraging flash and what those mean for a SQL Server Database Administrator.
