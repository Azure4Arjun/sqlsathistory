## Title: Azure Elastic Databases  Azure Elastic Jobs
## Abstract:
### A single Azure SQL Database gets dedicated resources (DTUs), which determine CPU, Memory, and the read-write rates that are available to use. The cost of each database is predefined according to the service tier and resources we choose, regardless the actual use.
Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool enables to manage and scale multiple Azure SQL Databases as a group. Databases in a pool share resources (eDTUs). It's a powerful and a cost-effective option for databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands.
During the meetup, we will review “Azure Elastic Pools” and “Azure Elastic Database jobs”, which enable us to execute queries across a group of databases, aggregate data from multiple databases, and improve performance. We will demonstrate the use and discuss cases, which can be optimized by using these features, including a real-life case where we reduce the cost dramatically.
Join the meeting and learn how to improve performance and reduce the cost of your Azure databases
