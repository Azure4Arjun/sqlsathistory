## Title: Practical SQL Azure: Moving into the Cloud
## Abstract:
### SQL Azure has been around for a few years now but you are still running all of your databases locally. You would like to use the cloud but you just aren't sure where to start. Come to this session and we will get you started down the right path. We will start by going over the basics of SQL Azure, including what it is, how to set it up and what the benefits and drawbacks are of it. Next, we will look at how to move an existing database into SQL Azure. Finally, we will look at how to take advantage of the benefits of the cloud to make your SQL database safer and more redundant. By the end of this session, you should have a good understanding of where you could go with SQL Azure and how to get there.
