## Title: Making Sense of the Power BI Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### Power BI adoption growth has been astonishing. And with growing demand we also have growing needs. The service started as an end user driven data visualization tool, but is now heading to an enterprise grade semantic layer. In this session, we will go through, and dive into, the Power BI pieces and service parts.  Weâ€™ll make sense of them together and when to apply and deploy each one.
