## Speaker: Jim McLeod
## Title: Are You Safe from Prying Eyes?
## Abstract:
### In our connected society, there are many avenues by which databases can be accessed by unauthorised people from both inside and outside your organisation. Even if your database does not contain sensitive information, it can still be damaging to your organisation if it is leaked, so care must be taken to ensure that both your SQL Server infrastructure and the data stored within the database has been appropriately secured. In this session, Jim McLeod explores the features available for encrypting data, securing the database instance, and options for auditing who has been looking or changing your data.
