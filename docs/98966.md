## Title: Logging Actual execution plans in SQL 2017 and 2019
## Abstract:
### Actual execution plan gives us most comprehensive info for tuning a query, much more than estimated plan.
Now it also includes wait statistics, logical reads, and actual row numbers for that execution.
But there is a catch - it is traditionally very expensive to track plans for all executions, even if we filter for only slow ones.
We will see how new versions of SQL Server evolved to get us actual plans without sacrificing performance.
Let me introduce you to "Lightweight profiling" you can have enabled all the time on your server, with close to zero impact.
