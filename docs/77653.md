## Title: Azure stream analytics
## Abstract:
### In many database applications we first log data and then, a few hours or days later, we start analyzing it. But in a world that's moving faster and faster, we sometimes need to analyze what is happening NOW.
Azure Stream Analytics allows you to analyze streams of data while they arrive. In this session you will see how to get started with Stream Analytics. We build and use a real-time application in this session. First we get started with Azure event hubs to collect data, then dive deeper into the temporal queries for analyzing the data.
