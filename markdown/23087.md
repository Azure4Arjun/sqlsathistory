## Title: Using TVPs in .Net applications
## Abstract:
### SQL Server introduced the ability to define TVPs (aka, User-Defined Table Types)  as a Read-Only parameter-type in stored procedures.  As usual, the .Net out-of-the-box experience is not the most performant.  To truly realize the full performance benefit with passing data from a .Net application via a TVP requires additional development.
