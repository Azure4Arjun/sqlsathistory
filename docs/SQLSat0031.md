## Speaker: Chuck Heinzelman Michael Steineke
## Title: Oh Cluster, My Cluster!
## Abstract:
### Clustering is a black box to many DBAs. Often, the IT dept configures  installs the SQL cluster then turns it over to DBAs to deploy databases and set up backup  maintenance plans. The problem is when things go wrong the DBAs are reliant on the IT dept when their time is better spent working on other things. The goal of this session is to discuss underlying aspects of SQL Server clustering. We will touch on OS and SQL Server issues as well as how it reacts differently being clustered vs non-clustered. We will also discuss the pitfalls of upgrading clustered databases and installing clusters from scratch including lessons learned from a real-world upgrade of a SQL Server cluster where the active and passive nodes are 1,200 miles apart!

# Wait-Time Based Performance Management
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#31-Chicago-2010)
Event Date: 17-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Dean Richards
## Title: Wait-Time Based Performance Management
## Abstract:
### Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

## Speaker: Jeremiah Peschka
## Title: A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL
## Abstract:
### Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

# Using XML to Query Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#31-Chicago-2010)
Event Date: 17-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Using XML to Query Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views.  The execution plans are a gold mine of information.  From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek.  Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your finger tips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases.

Goals:
1.	Discuss information available in an execution plan
2.	Demonstrate use of XQuery to query execution cache
3.	Demonstrate methods to performance tune
