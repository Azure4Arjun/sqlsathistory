## Speaker: Kevin Hazzard
## Title: Creating an Extensible Data Quality Foundation
## Abstract:
### Data Quality (DQ) tools are typically expensive and difficult to integrate into your ETL and governance plans but it doesn't have to be that way. During this fun, highly-interactive session, Kevin Hazzard (Microsoft Windows Azure MVP and author of the book Metaprogramming in .NET), will show you how to implement a modular, highly resilient DQ foundation from the tools you already own, no matter which version of SQL Server you're using today. At the end of this discussion, Kevin will give you a copy of his schema and his standard DQ function library that you can use in your own databases.
