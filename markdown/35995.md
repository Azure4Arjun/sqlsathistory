## Title: Auto generating a process data warehouse using Effektor
## Abstract:
### In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldom modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. In this talk I will show you how Effektor has overcome this difficult problem using an auto generated data warehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can auto generate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos. Examples is taken from Danish reporting on cancer treatment
