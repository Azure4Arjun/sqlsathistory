## Title: ( virtual ) SQL on Steroids
## Abstract:
### I/O performance and operational ease of use are key requirements for SQL Server deployments. While virtualization has delivered operational ease of use it has done so at the expense of I/O performance. This has resulted in excessive database tuning or expensive and disruptive infrastructure changes to alleviate the I/O bottlenecks. Database level In-Memory Computing while promising brings with it a slew of challenges including application rewrites. 

What if one could guarantee SQL Server latency would take a vacation as In-Memory performance would be smoking fast without any of the challenges that contemporary approaches incur? In this presentation Frank Brix Pedersen will introduce '( virtual ) SQL on Steroids' as a bullet proof way of providing RAM performance for SQL Server without any side effects, any application rewrites or changes to infrastructure.
