## Title: T-SQL Dynamic Duo: Window Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTE)
## Abstract:
### Life and movies have great dynamic duos: Hans Solo and Chewy, Bogey and Bacall, Batman and Robin, Red Wine and Dark Chocolate (my personal favorite) to name a few; now let me introduce you to another Dynamic Duo: Window Functions and CTEs.  Don’t confuse Window functions with the Windows operating system; Window functions are ANSI standard T-SQL functions used in writing queries.  Common Table Expressions (CTE) specifies a temporary named result set and are leveraged as a way to filter Window functions.
Window functions supercharge your code to show detail and aggregate level data in the same SELECT statement without grouping, easily creates running totals, computes percentages, de-dups data and more.  We’ll see how using the Offset functions enables you to include different values without using a self-join.  There’s much to see and learn in this demo packed session, I hope you’ll join me for another adventure!
