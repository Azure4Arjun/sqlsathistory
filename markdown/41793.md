## Title: SQL Server Foreign Keys â€“ De-mystifying the Rest of the Story
## Abstract:
### Foreign Keys are the ultimate Catch-22; you need them for data integrity, but they just kill insert, update, and delete performance.  In this session we will describe the concept of Foreign Keys and how they maintain data integrity.  You will learn their syntax for creating, deleting, disabling, and re-enabling.  You will also learn the possible effects of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification.   We will also examine the two most important Foreign Key attributes:  is_not_trusted and is_disabled and their effect on query performance.  All of these characteristics will be demo'ed with many script examples.
After attending this session you will 
1.	Comprehend the pro and cons of Foreign Keys in a real world production environment
2.	Understand the consequences of disabling and re-enabling Foreign Keys for data modification
3.	Be able to better assess best approach for Foreign Key maintenance
