## Title: Dissecting the Data Flow: SSIS Transformations, Memory  the Pipeline
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integrations Services is a robust product, with lots of different options available to the ETL developer. For someone new to SSIS, it can be daunting to be assigned a project to extract data from a source, transform it and then load it into its intended destination. What components do I use? Why pick one over another? Even if you are new to SSIS, it's good to have an understanding of what's going on under the hood when a package is run. Come to this session to learn what non-blocking, semi-blocking and fully-blocking transformations are. We'll explore how SSIS creates and manages memory buffers. You'll leave with a better understanding of how certain tasks and transformations can affect your packageâ€™s performance.
