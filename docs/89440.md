## Title: Utilizing Azure DevOps on a BI Project
## Abstract:
### DevOps has historically been a term associated with software engineering, but did you know it can have a number of benefits in the BI space? Using Azure DevOps, code changes and ETL pipelines can be managed and deployed in a partially or fully automated, repeatable process. In doing so, bugs and integration issues can be detected and resolved early, while also saving time in doing manual migrations.

In this session, we will explore the intersect between Azure DevOps and BI, the tools needed to implement, and a real-life example of how it all works together.
