## Title: Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics
## Abstract:
### Have your tables and indexes that have grown rather large? Are they taking longer to query? Are your windows for maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, table partitioning may be for you!
With table partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and sliding windows. You'll see how we can make our index and statistics maintenance easier. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and be able to make decisions on how and when to implement.
