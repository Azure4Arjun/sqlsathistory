## Title: CosmosDB - Understanding the main factors for successful deployment
## Abstract:
### Let's face it: Microsoft Data Platform is not just SQL Server anymore. Azure has added a dozen of other data related products to the menu. Being a cloud DBA means dealing with these new options when needed. 
In this session packed with demos you will see how to cross the bridge between SQL Server and Cosmos DB back and forth; how to related items from both sides and what is required to design a CosmosDB deployment.
