## Title: Getting Started with the Entity Framework 4.0
## Abstract:
### In this session, we’ll…
 
•         Explore the Entity Framework 4.0, its related components and show how it all works
•         Demonstrate how to build a business object model (Entity Data Model) and database mappings, from a database, from a model or from code
•         Walk through a variety of examples of how to interact with the model 
•         Take a close look at how and why EF 4.0 implements “Persistence Ignorance”
•         Show how to implement Entity Framework in a multi-tiered application

You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework 4.0 can greatly simplify your DAL and enable you to program against a conceptual model of your data, versus the actual data store itself
