## Title: Optimizing Database Access And Diving Into .Net SqlClient
## Abstract:
### The prevailing opinion is that the optimizations for SQL Server are usually only done on the server itself. But is there anything we can do on the client to gain more speed? Because there are always at least two sides of the performance coin, in this session aimed at .Net and SQL developers, we'll dive into the workings of the .Net SqlClient and give you insight into things like connection pools, transaction scopes, batch inserting, async data access and more.
