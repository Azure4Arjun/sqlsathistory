## Title: Hacking Expos#233; Too - Just How Transparent is TDE?
## Abstract:
### You have to be compliant, but can’t change source code, or SQL code. What’s your option? Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) of course! 
The real question though, is just how transparent is TDE?
In this, the second installment of the Hacking Expos#233; series, we will assume the role of a hacker once more and dig into our database and steal our backups and data files. We will then try to restore the files, and even dig into the files themselves and see what might be exposed.
We then go through the steps to lock down our data using TDE.
Once again we assume the role of a hacker and try to dig through the database, steal backups and data files and see just what is available to us.
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as some actual hacking techniques are used.
