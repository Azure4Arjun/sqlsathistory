## Title: Advanced SQL Server execution plans
## Abstract:
### Tired to look at colored and nice shape plans? Want to go further and see geek stuff? Came to this session to explore the query trees, internals and deep analysis on execution plans on SQL Server. This is a advanced session, so, expect to see lots of traceflags, undocumented and nasty execution plans.
