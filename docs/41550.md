## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Big Data, Small Data, and Everything In Between
## Abstract:
### The breadth of options available to data professionals today is staggering:  between relational, object, graph, and document databases, we have a wide array of storage options, as well as a huge number of access and analysis tools.  This talk will walk you through data platform, data analysis, and data processing options.  Weâ€™ll discuss when to use (and when not to use) Spark, R, Storm, and SSAS, as well as a range of other tools and technologies.  By the end of this talk, you may not have MongoDB or Neo4J, but you will know where they might fit.
