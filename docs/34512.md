## Title: Looking at LINQ
## Abstract:
### LINQ was introduced in .NET 3.0... by .NET 4.0 parts of it are almost depricated.  Let's look at LINQ, what are its strengths, where does it fit moving forward.  We'll talk about LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Dataset, LINQ to Entities, LINQ to CAML and where each of these fit.
