## Speaker: Mattias Lind
## Title: Entity Framework, from a database perspective
## Abstract:
### Entity Framework enables developers interact with databases through a logical model with entities and methods and such, and by default generate CRUD-operation and translates them to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. The session is about this and how we can extend the logical model with access objects within the database to support this interaction, and by that enable for performance optimization and higher levels of security without the need of changing a single bit of code in the application layers. The session is a bit like eating the cake and still have it left.
