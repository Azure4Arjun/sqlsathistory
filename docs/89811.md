## Title: End-to-end monitoring for a successful Power BI implementation
## Abstract:
### Implementing Power BI in your organisation is more then allowing people to download Power BI desktop and publish reports to the Power BI Service. People have to be aware of what Power BI is able to achieve for them! But how do you know who is creating what? Using what? Or maybe even more important, sharing (confidential) information with others? 

With a Power BI end-to-end monitor you will be able to monitor all Power BI content allover your tenant. These actionable insights will help you to see who needs some extra help, but also in governing your data solutions within your organisation. 

In this session I will show you which insights you will get with an end-to-end monitor and how you can monitor your own Power BI environment.
