## Title: Find Bad Queries: Profiler, DMVs, Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Learn how I find high cost queries using the SQL Server 2008 tools. DMV's are great for finding a lot of problems fast. But, sometimes you still need Profiler. I will discuss cases where the DMV's are all you need. I will also discuss how to get information from Profiler that is missing from the DMV data. Extended Events are powerful and will be a major tool in the future of troubleshooting. I will explain why we need Extended Events to solve problems in addition to DMV's and Profiler.
