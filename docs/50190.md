## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, itâ€™s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.
