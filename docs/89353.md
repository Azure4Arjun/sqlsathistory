## Title: Performance tuning with SQL Server memory grants
## Abstract:
### When you're performance tuning queries with memory grants, you want to know where, how and why the memory is granted and used in your query.

In this session, we'll talk about analyzing requested and granted memory inside execution plans, the plan cache, and in currently running queries.

We'll also talk about troubleshooting your system when many queries have memory grants. 

Prerequisites: General knowledge of execution plans and query writing
