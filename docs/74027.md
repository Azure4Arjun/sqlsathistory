## Title: SPECIAL KEYNOTE: The DBA is DEAD!   Long live the NEW DBA !
## Abstract:
### The DBA's role is slowly changing and some of the old-school DBA work gradually becomes irrelevant. New technologies such as the cloud, big data, devops and automation are making many of the classic DBA tasks simply unnecessary.
Are DBAs no longer needed? (spoiler: they still are).
What should you do to stay relevant amidst the technology changes in the industry?
We will talk about the new industry trends that are changing the DBA's role, about new career paths that the "new DBA" can take and what new skills DBAs should acquire for each of these paths.
