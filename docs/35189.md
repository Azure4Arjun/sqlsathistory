## Title: Migrating DTS Packages to SSIS
## Abstract:
### Upgrading to SQL Server 2005 can be a major challenge for companies, but migrating your DTS packages to SSIS packages doesn't have to be.  This session will walk you through the steps needed to migrate your packages, including using the Upgrade Advisor and the Package Migration Wizard.  We will discuss the items that the Wizard can handle, how to adjust for items that the Wizard can handle, and when it is best to throw the Wizard out the window.
