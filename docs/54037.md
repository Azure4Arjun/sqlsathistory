## Title: WhereScape RED - an agile IDE for Data Warehouses
## Abstract:
### This session shows how you can use WhereScape RED  to accelerate project delivery and drive agile development of your data warehouse.

There is a proliferation of beautiful tools for providing data visualizations and self-service data delivery to business users - but these tools rely on having data available, often in a data warehouse.  And building / maintaining the data warehouse is often the lengthy, fraught part of BI projects.  

WhereScape RED is an IDE for building and managing data warehouses, marts, stores and vaults.  RED supports all common modeling approaches and architectures in an open, flexible and scalable environment.  Developers use RED to massively accelerate delivery and documentation of rapid / agile projects without sacrificing control.  

Join us for a discussion and demonstration on how you can deliver projects with the business to empower your enterprise with data - leveraging the MS BI Stack!
