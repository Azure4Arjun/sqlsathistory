## Speaker: Tom Groszko
## Title: Writting DML Triggers
## Abstract:
### I will present INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSTEAD OF triggers using T-SQL. I will not be talking about CLR triggers. I will compare triggers to constraints, discuss security, demonstrate what each kind of trigger does, explain T-SQL trigger specific statements, enabling and disabling, ordering the sequence of trigger execution, demonstrate how to use the INSERTED and DELETED tables available in a trigger.
