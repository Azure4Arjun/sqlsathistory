## Title: R for Reporting
## Abstract:
### R is actually a really nice, practical language that you can use to do ETL and reporting. You can do it for free and you don’t even need a Coursera course in stats to be able to use it. In this talk, we’re going to look at how we can get started using R for reporting.

We’ll look at building dashboards, from connecting to our database, wrangling our data, to presenting good looking charts back to the user.
