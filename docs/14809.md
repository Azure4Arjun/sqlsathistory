## Title: Using Microsoft Tools for Healthcare BI
## Abstract:
### Based upon experience with implementing healthcare BI solutions for clients with hospital visit data, this presentation will discuss common healthcare BI challenges and review solutions for those challenges using Microsoft tools. A demonstration of how Microsoft BI tools can be used to provide valuable reporting insights will be accompanied by a discussion about architectural challenges with healthcare data. How can there be a unified data warehouse when various departments have different requirements? How can Microsoft BI tools such as SSAS, SSRS, PerformancePoint, Excel, and PowerPivot provide immediate reporting value? Can Performance Measures be built into a BI solution? These questions and more will be reviewed and discussed.
