## Title: Master Data and Data Quality in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### A recent survey by Information Week found that data quality is the greatest barrier to BI adoption in enterprises.  MDS addresses this challenge with modeling, validation, alerting and security capabilities.  In this presentation, you will learn how to use MDS to model your data to ensure correctness, update it with changes from your ERP, and create workflows with notifications.  Next you will learn the capabilities of DQS and see how it addresses data standardization, completeness and other challenges.  You will then see how to use them together to enable Enterprise Information Management.  BI professionals will come away with knowledge on how to use tools that address the greatest risk to success for BI projects - data quality.
