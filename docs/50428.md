## Speaker: Kris Hokanson
## Title: Random Acts of Senseless Databasing
## Abstract:
### After years of snake oil salesmen and good-meaning but part-time developers, Acme Oil  Gas company’s databases have become something Rube Goldberg would be proud of and they've hired you to sort everything out. What are some of the things you can expect to find and how can you fix them? From spaghetti code that references views inside of views nested in other views, to overly indexed tables that generate 10x the disk IO and contention they should, we’ll talk about database development, administration, and plenty of things in between.
