## Title: The Accidental Programmer
## Abstract:
### Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who out of nowhere get thrown into working with databases. Well what about the other side of the coin? What about those DB Developers and DBA's who have to write code? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. You will learn how to recognize when bad code is written that interacts with the database, how to track it down, and most importantly how to fix it. On top of that you will also receive an introduction to object oriented programming concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, tier architecture, and class objects so that you can better communicate with your programmers.
