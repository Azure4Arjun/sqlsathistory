## Speaker: Josh Burgin
## Title: PBI Dataflows for the BI Pro
## Abstract:
### New Power BI features such as Dataflows are blurring the lines between a citizen BI developer's role and a professional BI developer's role.  In this session we'll look at how PBI Dataflows should be used by a professional BI developer (hint... AI is one reason) and when more robust analytic tools should be used.
