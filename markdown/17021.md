## Title: Designing Custom Maintenance Plans with TSQL
## Abstract:
### Have you ever received a call from a client asking for help when their SQL Server database is corrupted?  You suggest that they restore the database from the last good backup.  There is a long pause on the phone as the client states that the only backups/tapes they have are bad.  Do not let this situation happen to you!  

I will review how to build a custom maintenance plans from the ground up using TSQL commands.  What are the best practices for daily, weekly and monthly tasks?  This presentation includes tape rotation schemes and restoring those backups to make sure they really work.  If you company has the budget, use disk to disk backups to reduce the backup/restore times.
