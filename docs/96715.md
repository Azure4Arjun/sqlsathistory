## Speaker: Warren du Toit
## Title: SQL Server Always On Availability Groups on Azure Kubernetes Services
## Abstract:
### It sounds more difficult than it is, but using Azure's Resource Manager deployment engine and preconfigured templates, we can deploy a fully functional Kubernetes cluster in Azure with persistent storage. The Templates use CNAB, Cloud Native Application Bundles to achieve this. We take a deeper look at how this is deployed and how you can use containerisation for your Highly Available Data Workloads.
