## Title: SQL Server database perfomance on Azure, Google and AWS cloud platform
## Abstract:
### The popular image of cloud services is both attractive and enticing. Your systems can run seamlessly at peak performance anywhere in the world, and It is natural to assume that the performance of cloud services is identical and stable, regardless of whether itâ€™s located.
To confirm if this is really the case, a series of performance tests were conducted on Microsoft SQL Server in three different locations and on three different cloud platforms: Azure, AWS and Google. We also compeer the results, from three Azure Service tiers (Basic 5 DTU, Standard S3 100 DTU and Premium P2 250 DTU) with previous tests from December 2016 and March 2018.

We will present the test methods and the results and findings.
Based on our measurements we have seen:

-	Significant variations in performance between the different geographical locations
-	Significant variations in performance for the same database at different times
-	Surprisingly poor performance of Azure Basic and Standard tiers
