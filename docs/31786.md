## Title: Programming with OData  the Microsoft Data Stack
## Abstract:
### Data is the core of why we build systems and solutions and look for opportunities to automate and simplify. What are the options and when do you make the tradeoffs? In this session, we look at what's new with the Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework and explain how it works with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Representational State Transfer (REST), and RIA Data Services. We also explore the technologies and the trends that are driving the ADO.NET Entity Framework to see how to take advantage of these new technologies.
