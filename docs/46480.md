## Title: Cluster@#$%! High Availability Solutions. What Could Go Wrong?
## Abstract:
### If you have a high availability need in your production environment -- and who doesn't, these days -- you've probably had to think through the options. Clustering, Availabililty Groups, Mirroring, Replication, a third-party solution? 

Even when you make an informed decision about what high-availability implementation you'll use, are you sure it will come online and stay online? Join John in this review of some of the more prominent failures (and their solutions) in commonly used high-availability configurations.
