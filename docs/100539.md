## Title: Data-Driven Diversity
## Abstract:
### Data is all around us. From calculating projections to influencing meaningful decision-making, the impact data has on the way we live and work is increasing rapidly. But, what does this mean for data processes and the business world as a whole, when not everyone has a seat at the table? During this presentation, LaShana Lewis will outline the importance of diversity in business and how you can consider data through the lens of diversity and inclusion, using your skills as a data professional to raise awareness and make lasting change.
