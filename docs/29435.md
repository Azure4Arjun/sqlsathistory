## Title: Table Fission - An Introduction to Partition|ing
## Abstract:
### Partitioning technology distributes data in a single table among several individual filegroups.  When implemented carefully, this allows DBAs to instantaneously move large amounts of data from one table to another.  After this session, attendees will understand how partitioning works, when it is beneficial, and how to implement a basic setup.  We will also illustrate partitioning in a practical "sliding window" demonstration.  This will be a broad, high-level introduction to the technology.
