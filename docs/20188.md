## Title: Extreme Design – A Real World 10+ Exabyte Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### A large number of people, including many at Microsoft have bought into the marketing BS called “Big Data”.  When you hear “big data”, everyone automatically assumes that you have to do this in some other database platform being foisted on IT.  Microsoft starts a sentence with “big data” and finishes the sentence with Hadoop.  The implication all over the industry and from Microsoft itself is that SQL Server can’t handle “big data”.  This session will walk you through the architecture and build out of a real world data warehouse, spanning over 600,000 SQL Servers, which is currently in excess of 10 Exabytes.  We melted a set of Hadoop clusters before they even came close to what SQL Server was serving.
