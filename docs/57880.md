## Title: Building Effective Backups
## Abstract:
### There are few aspects of a database infrastructure that are as basic, yet as critical as backups.  Determining an appropriate backup methodology and architecting a fitting solution for it is critical to data security and the ability to service emergency requests.

Time constraints often cause us to lean on maintenance plans or third party tools to handle backups for us, but having a full understanding of the necessary processes involved is critical to having backup and restore processes that will provide us with exactly what we want, when we need it.

This is an opportunity to create a backup solution from scratch that takes into account the most important aspects of a backup process and can easily be customized to fit the needs of any database environment.
