## Title: Hands-on with U-SQL and Azure Data Lake Analytics
## Abstract:
### U-SQL is the query language for big data analytics on the Azure Data Lake platform. This session will explore the unification of SQL and C# in this new query language, examples of combining data from external sources such as Azure SQL Database and Blob storage with Azure Data Lake Store, creating and referencing assemblies, job submission and tools. The ADL platform will also be compared and contrasted to the HDInsight/Hadoop platform.
