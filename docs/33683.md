## Title: Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
## Abstract:
### We often run a fine line between how much space we need, and how much space we have for our databases. Having too much drive space can be a waste of resources; however, running out of space is an obvious issue. Let’s find a way to straddle the line and determine just how much space we really need, give ourselves a bit more than that, and make it a regular process to baseline, then continue to monitor, make adjustments along the way if needed, and ultimately plan for just enough space to get us through the year on budget. We’ll talk about a stand-alone tool that I used to determine space use for baseline, continued monitoring of the space used, and ensuring we have enough but not too much space.
