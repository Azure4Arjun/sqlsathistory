## Title: Merge Replication 101
## Abstract:
### Merge replication â€“ Some people hate it and some people love it.  
    Merge replication can be used to provide an autonomous (writable) copy of a database.  It is easy to set up and is very failure-resilient.  It can be used as a database high-availability method.
    I will explain why I am a lover of merge replication.  I will demonstrate merge replication set up, explain conflict resolution, and tell stories from my experience to illustrate its resilience.
