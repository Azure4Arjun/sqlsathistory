## Title: Unseen Minions: Improving Parallel Processing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Some SQL Server Integration Services use cases are too complicated to simply read data from a source and write it to a destination. You could try looking for a third-party framework or components to help, but then again, you might just need to add some knowledge. This session is designed to help you maximize the parallel processing capabilities of SSIS.

We’ll cover in detail alternative methods of managing large workloads by using traditional programming methods, including named pipes, queues, and producers/consumer architecture – all from within SSIS itself. We'll then cover methods of dividing workloads and preventing bottlenecks, as well as techniques to improve the resource efficiency of SSIS.
