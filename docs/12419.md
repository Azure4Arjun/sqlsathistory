After this session you will be able to create everything above without learning R, or stepping out of the Microsoft BI stack. You’ll see how you can create fantastic data visualizations that are better than you could accomplish in the same time with years of experience in expensive statistical packages like SAS or SPSS. More importantly than the how’s, you’ll leave knowing the when’s to use these powerful data science tools.
