## Speaker: Andrew Holowaty
## Title: Full life-cycle of Self-Service BI with PowerPivot and the SSAS Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Within the enterprise, the new Excel self-service tools can enable Power Users to define and create analytic requirements by creating new business models in PowerPivot. We will walk through a scenario of creating relationships, hierarchies, KPIs, calculations, and measures as a business person.  When completed we will hand it off the model to the governance board for review to see how it fits into the organization BI collateral.  Finally, we will put on our IT hats and convert the PowerPivot model into a SSAS Tabular version and give it enterprise strength of partitions and security.  We will end the session by selecting a deployment strategy that will meet the needs of new and existing models in the production environment.
