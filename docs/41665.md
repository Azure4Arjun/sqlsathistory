## Title: Moving Beyond Unconscious Bias
## Abstract:
### People love patterns. We simplify our lives by categorizing all day long – things, activities, and even people. Categories let us make sense of a constant bombardment of sensations. But what happens when we unconsciously categorize someone at work? How do these categories box us in? Let’s talk about what we can do to shake up those categories and drive towards a more diverse and productive workplace.
