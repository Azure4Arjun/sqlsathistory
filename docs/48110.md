## Title: Algorithms For Searching Through Encrypted Data
## Abstract:
### Proper way of storing encrypted data is to encrypt it on the client and send it to the server that doesn't know how to decrypt it.
However this solution lacks a simple way of searching through the encrypted data once it's on the server.
You can do equality checks, but that's where most applications stop. 
But what to do if you have thousands of text documents you need to search through?
Getting them all to the client and decrypting them there is simply out of the question 
as it would slow the system down to a crawl due to latency.
In this session we'll take a look at a few algorithms that enable you to search through the encrypted text data on the server without decrypting anything and returning only the search results to the client with performance in mind.
Just the way a search should be performed.
