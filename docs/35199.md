## Title: Database development using Team System 2008
## Abstract:
### Ever make a bunch of changes to your database then lose track of what you’ve changed? Frustrated with trying to come up with consistent, “meaningful” test data to test your applications? Wish you could unit test your database? Ever forget to make a backup copy of your stored procedure before you made that one line change (that happens to crash the system)? Tired of feeling like you’re not part of the team? We’ll take a look at how Team System can help ease the pain of database development and change management.
