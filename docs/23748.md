## Title: Enforce Best Practices with CMS and Policy Based Management
## Abstract:
### If you manage a large environment then you know how hard it can be to make sure all your SQL Servers adhere to best practice settings and more importantly is making sure they stay that way.  I'll show you how to check those settings across all your servers with Central Management Server and how it can help you manage a disperse environment.  You will also learn how to leverage the power of Policy Based Management to help you enforce those settings and standards in your enterprise.  Best of all you will see how to get alerts sent to you when one of your standard settings is changed.
