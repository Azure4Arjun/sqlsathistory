## Title: SQL Server Preproduction Tasks
## Abstract:
### This session will cover the tasks you need to perform before you hand over a new SQL Server to production in order to keep the server running smoothly. After this session, you should be able to create a script that best suits your organization in order to make moving a server into production a quick and easy process. While the session is geared towards new systems, many of these preproduction considerations apply to existing SQL Servers as well.
