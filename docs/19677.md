## Title: Proactively+Automagically Manage your SQL footprin
## Abstract:
### As a DBA I think it's essential to stay proactive and ahead of the game.  Using SSIS, SSRS, and a little bit of creativity I cut down the amount of time spent firefighting and come to meetings with quantitative answers for questions like:

1.  How can we do Capacity Planning based on actual data growth trends?
2.  How many databases out there have missing indexes, and what are the indexes?
3.  Are you 100% certain your databases are backed up, even if you haven't seen any failure alerts come through?
4.  Developers' application logs report that SQL sessions were timing out a couple days ago.  What was going on in SQL at that time?
5.  What databases are set to Autogrow in too small of increments (and/or growing too frequently)?
