## Title: Hardware Planning  Sizing for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### On-Premise Server are still here and will surely last for a while. Buying a server isn't s complex task, but buying the server that maximize the ROI of the money you spent on it is not an easy task, since there is so much choice that finding the correct machine is really not trivial. In this session we'll see the internals of a server, learning how memory, cpu, disks and all the rest works together.   Along with some basic numbers and math we'll see how to find the correct hardware needed and how to evaluate the server we're going to buy, before releasing it in production and realizing, too late, that it physically can't delivery the performance we need.
