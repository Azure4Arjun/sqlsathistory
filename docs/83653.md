## Title: What To Learn Next
## Abstract:
### As technologists, we continually adapt to changing market needs and the maturity of concepts and tools. What To Learn Next explores four topics, each having important considerations for your opportunities in the next three to five years.

High Demand/Low Supply explores the effect on data technologists from social media, biztech media, and the modern focus on employee experience. So Many Technologies looks into the layers of technologies, from core to the edge, that define our world of data. Too Many Products gives a view of the hundreds of products in category upon category. Only the liar could know them all. This session concludes with a look at How To Learn, including the pros and cons of online, meetups, classroom, conference, and video - even books!

What To Learn Next will be most valuable to intermediate and advanced SQL Server professionals who seek to augment their current skills with modern, strategic data technologies.
