## Title: SQL Server 2019 - Intelligent Query Performance features
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2019 is the latest release only 7 or 8 months old. It is time now to learn about some awesome features of this release. Like previous versions, SQL Server 2019 comes with a plethora of new features as well as with enhancements to the existing ones. 
In this session, I will discuss and show demos of Intelligent Query Processing family of features. IQP has taken the performance of SQL Server to the next level, never seen or imagined before. We will see in action how with minimum or no changes from DBA or Developer, your query performance improves automagically just by going to compatibility level 150 (SQL Server 2019).
You will leave this session with a solid understanding of some of the best new features of SQL Server 2019 and hopefully you will be motivated to try them yourself.
