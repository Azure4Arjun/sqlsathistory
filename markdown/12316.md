## Speaker: Dave Green
## Title: "I'm sure my procedure does what it should!"
## Abstract:
### Or, using unit tests to produce better quality code and do less (re)work!

In this brisk session we will discuss some of the reasons to unit test your procedures as well as which tests are and are not appropriate as unit tests. We will look at how to use the open source tSQLt framework to achieve repeatable unit tests, including Test Driven Development approaches and writing tests for existing stored procedures; in short everything you need to begin writing unit tests for the stored procedures in your databases.
