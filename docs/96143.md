## Title: Confidence – The Best Super-Power
## Abstract:
### Have you thought about wanting to do something and thought you may not be successful at it, so it then became too much work to try?  The American Pastor Robert Shuler famously asked a very powerful question: “What would you do if you knew you could not fail?”  Confidence allows us to dream big and gives us the fuel to escape from a world of apathy.  It gets us out of bed ready for action; ready to do something that will move us towards achieving whatever goal we set for ourselves.  Without the confidence to at least try, we are sure to fail.  If we try, but only half heartedly because we lack confidence, we will likely fail.  Confidence will improve your odds of success in any endeavor.  
Confidence is only 25% genetic.  Let’s improve the other 75%.
