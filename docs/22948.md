## Title: SSIS 2012: Project Deployment Model End To End
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 makes major improvements to SSIS in a number of areas: development experience, troubleshooting, deployment and management. Many of these improvements are based on the new server side catalog (SSISDB) and are available only when you use the new Project Deployment Model. In this session, you will learn how to create projects using the new deployment model, deploy, track, execute and manage SSIS packages. We will also explore some of the improvements in SQL Server Data Tools -formerly known as BIDS-, and the server side user experience using SSMS. Whether you are new to SSIS or planning to upgrade your skills to the new version, you will find the information given in this session valuable.
