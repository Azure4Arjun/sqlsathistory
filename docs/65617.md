## Title: Customizing SQL Server 2016 Mobile Report Publisher
## Abstract:
### In Reporting Services 2016 Microsoft introduced support for mobile reports. They also released the Mobile Report Publisher for authoring and creation of mobile reports. 
Developers can create dashboards and KPI and publish them on Reporting Services in a very straightforward way. The downside is that Mobile Report Publisher offers simple features and settings for data visualization and parameterization.

Want to add parameters to a mobile report? Want to add drillthrough and navigation from one report to another? Want to design and import a custom map, for your visualizations?
Want to implement security and filter visibility based on the user's grants? Want to apply a custom layout to your portal?
In this session you'll find the solutions that best fit your needs based on real implementation in a large company.
