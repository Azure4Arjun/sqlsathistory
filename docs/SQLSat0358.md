## Speaker: Meredith Ryan-Smith
## Title: Women In Tech Panel discussion
## Abstract:
### The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.   Attend this WIT session with panelists Melody Zacharias, Ginger Grant, Amy Herold, and Meredith Ryan to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/) before the event and print out the results and recommendation. NOTE: You will not be required to share your results with the other participants during the session.

## Title: Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
## Abstract:
### Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.

## Speaker: Ron Beatty
## Title: SSIS ETL for Type1 and Type2 SCD
## Abstract:
### How to handle and track changes in a data warehouse dimension table is an important dimensional modeling consideration. The dimension tables of a data warehouse need to be designed to appropriately store a history of attribute changes over time. The ETL processes need to detect these changes and correctly update the dimensional table to preserve historical accuracy. Finally, fact records need to be associated with the correct historical version of the dimension. In this presentation, a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) will be demonstrated that creates an ETL data flow which will load a dimensional table with both Type 1 and Type 2 dimensional attributes.

## Speaker: Russ Thomas
## Title: PaaF: Performance as a Feature in an ORM World
## Abstract:
### A high performing data tier does not happen by accident.  High quality shops understand that performance must be designed as a feature.  While SQL Server remains one of the most popular databases in the world, the modern software engineer would rather learn Entity Framework, Dapper, or ORMLite over straight TSQL.  Since the TSQL keys have in many cases been handed over to a service tier or ORM, maintaining a high performing database in this environment places significant emphasis on fundamental design.  This session will identify the 5 most important factors that every database requires to support "performance as a feature".  This session is for the Software Engineer or DBA/Data Architect/DBE who works with database servers where TSQL has b

## Title: DIY Performance Reporting
## Abstract:
### Stop relying on vendors to provide you with performance data.  Between Windows and SQL Server you’ve already got all you need to collect and report on server performance.  And it’s far more flexible than you’ll ever get from a vendor.  This is often called a poor man’s method, but it’s so much more than that.  I’m going to show you what your options are for collecting performance data for free and you’ll even walk away with a framework you can plug into your own environment and start using tomorrow with very little effort.

## Speaker: Steve Wake
## Title: Date Dimension: Past  Future in One Script
## Abstract:
### All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most Data Warehouse designers will just use one provided by tools or whip it up in Excel, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all of the calculations and formatting up-front so the reports can be easier to create. Sample script will be provided that creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse and it only take seconds to run!

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Incremental Load Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads.
 
In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will demonstrate some of the methods for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:
--Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate
--Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?
--Methods for detecting new and changed records
--Common incremental load design patterns

## Title: Life Lessons in Communication
## Abstract:
### Communicating. We all do it, every day. But can you do it better? You present to management, share with peers, advise your direct reports. A common thread of success or failure here is how well you get your message across. 
Can you share bad news and soften the blow with humor while respecting the nature of the news you have to deliver?
Can you support your direct reports when they make a very human mistake?
Do you know how you communicate your support without micromanaging them can make a huge difference in the quality of their work for years to come? 
These questions and more will be answered, with stories, with humor, and with experience (both good and bad).
Once you've figured these things out, how do you communicate your own skills to the world? 
After attending, you’ll be on the road to better, more direct communication, whether it’s with your management, your peers, or your reports.

This session provides a general survival guide to assist with the DBA’s journey to the “other-side”.    An overview will be presented on the differences  similarities between Oracle and SQL server in the areas of:  terminology, object structures, memory, storage architecture, back  recovery, basic administration, data transfers, security and performance analysis.   We’ll discuss steps  strategies to help guide you in learning this new database skill set, and also look at common performance analysis tools which can be used across both Oracle and SQL Server databases.   Whether a DBA, developer or manager, this overview will help gain a basic understanding of the key similarities and differences between SQL Server  Oracle.
