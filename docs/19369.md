## Title: Hekaton, In-Memory OLTP, or where is the magic of SQL Server 2014?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2014 introduces memory-optimized database technology for optimizing the performance of OLTP workloads or In-Memory OLTP. In particular, it introduces memory-optimized tables for efficient, contention-free data access, and natively compiled stored procedures for efficient execution of business logic. How fast is the fastest? How cool are the coolest? What are those new technologies coming directly from Microsoft Research into the next version Engine? The session drills down into In_Memory OLTP as the most exciting feature of SQL Server 2014. Of course we will see some other surprises of the new version.
