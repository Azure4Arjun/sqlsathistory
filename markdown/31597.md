## Title: Implementing Fine-grained Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data security presents a challenge for many groups in a company. Application requirements often specify different data content for various users, while those responsible for security recognize the need to limit access as much as possible.  Available options typically involve trade-offs in security, flexibility, and added work. SQL Server provides a number of security features, but row-level security is missing.  This session will consider some current architectural approaches to implementing flexible data security, and then examine a packaged solution for SQL Server to effectively customize row and column access for users without login accounts.
