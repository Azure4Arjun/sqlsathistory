## Title: Amazon Web Services RDS with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Are you wanting to make more SQL Servers but don't want to invest in more hardware? Then Relational Database Service (RDS) in Amazon Web Services (AWS) maybe the right choice for you. We will begin with creating a server using the Amazon Web Console, explore how to automate installation through Cloud Formation, show how to administrate the service, and walk through advanced features. Whether you are familiar with AWS or are brand new to it, this presentation should at least give you a good overview to decide if RDS is the right service for you.
