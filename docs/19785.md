## Title: Fast Track Your BI Projects With Biml
## Abstract:
### You’re a business intelligence developer or manager trying to provide quality data in a timely, cost-effective manner. Perhaps you’ve considered Agile methodology, but found that the details of ETL, the plumbing if you will, makes iterative development all but impossible. In just this session Peter will demonstrate a flexible and reusable framework for storing and managing the metadata that you will use as an input to your BimlScripts, alleviating the pain and tedium of data warehouse development.
