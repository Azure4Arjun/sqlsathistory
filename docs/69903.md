## Title: Dynamic Data Masking - A Deep Dive Implementation
## Abstract:
### One of the highly touted features of SQL 2016 is Dynamic Data Masking (DDM).  In this session, we will take an in-depth deep dive into implementing DDM and discover its good, bad, and indifferent features.  We will discuss use cases where DDM can help and where it may hinder development, QA, or auditing use cases.  Attendees will leave the session with the knowledge needed to deploy a comprehensive DDM solution in their environments should DDM be a match for their use cases.  High level data protection and auditing topics will be discussed as well.
