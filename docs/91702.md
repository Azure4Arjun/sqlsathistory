## Title: Introduction to Polybase
## Abstract:
### Polybase started as a technology which allows you to query data stored in Hadoop or Azure Blob Storage as if it were just another table within SQL Server. As you move your data estate from on-premises to a cloud architecture, Polybase will be at the center of your cloud strategy.  Data Integration (DI) is replacing traditional ETL for cloud architecture, and central to this strategy is the separation of storage from compute.  

Come to this Intermediate talk to learn how you can get started using Polybase in SQL Server right away and learn about the 3 core EXTERNAL objects used in Polybase.  We will compare the differences and similarities between Polybase and Linked Servers.  In SQL 'Aris' (2019), Polybase will grow further and add additional connectivity and querying potential.  We will take a first look at how Polybase is central to SQL 2019 Big Data Clusters.  Azure Kubernetes Services makes SQL Server Big Data Clusters easy to create and deploy.
