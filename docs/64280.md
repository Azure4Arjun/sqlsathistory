## Title: Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?
## Abstract:
### Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.
