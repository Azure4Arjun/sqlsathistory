## Title: RESTful JSON API Microservices and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Transforming your enterprise or startup using micro services that rely on SQL Server data can be a challenge.  There are so many options out there.  I will introduce how you can jump into API driven develop with lightning fast frameworks that make your job easy and simple.  Explore how we leverage Entity Framework to quick start your data models with code-first prototyping.  Then we will explore how to transition back when you're ready for deployment.  SQL Server offers native tools for JSON support in the newest 2016 release but if you don't have that luxury we'll explore legacy versions as well.  API driven development can transform your software development lifecycle so join me as we get you going in the right direction with the latest frameworks and tools.  Source code will be provided of a standard API framework with a real data model to accompany your efforts.  We will also touch on OAuth 2.0, Unit Testing, and Continuous Integration (CI) for truly streamlined SQL powered apps.
