## Title: Deconstructing Deceptively Simple DAX
## Abstract:
### DAX is the cornerstone for providing calculations within the SSAS Tabular Model, Power Pivot and Power BI. In this presentation, we will take a deeper look into some common DAX calculations and why they can be deceptively simple.  I’ll show how subtle differences in DAX expressions can have a significant impact on the results. I’ll share my experience working with DAX to help give you an important understanding of how DAX expressions are evaluated.  Knowing these concepts will enable you to leverage and use the intricate capabilities in the DAX language and get the results you expect.  This presentation assumes that you have some experience with DAX.
