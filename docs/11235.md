## Title: Tools and Tips: From accidental to efficient Data Warehouse developer
## Abstract:
### You have probably heard about the Accidental DBA, but what about the Accidental Data Warehouse developer? We stumbled into the world of data warehousing, learned dimensional modeling and work with T-SQL and SSIS daily. We're masters of googling solutions to our problems and make sure our complex ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users... but we don't deliver data as fast as we want. 
 
You might not be able to rewrite your entire data warehouse or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient data warehouse developer. 
 
In this session I will show you some of what I've learned and discovered that has made me burst out "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" including query improvements, free tools and scripts, SSMS features and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.
