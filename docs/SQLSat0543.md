# Automated Database Developmer Testing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#543-Manchester-2016)
Event Date: 23-07-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Ed Elliott
## Title: Automated Database Developmer Testing
## Abstract:
### Oscar Wilde once said "We are all in the gutter, but some of us have unit tests" and it is as true then as it is now - databases hold code and if you want to:

- Make changes faster
- Improve the quality of your code
- Provide guaranteed examples that are proven to work

Then you should look at database testing but what is database testing? What are unit tests? Integration tests? Acceptance tests? How do you get started and keep going with automated testing?

In this session we will answer these questions and give examples of how to test database code and some of the challenges you will face along the way.

Whether you are completly new to developer testing or have been been "a mocking and asserting" in c# or java for years this session will get you started writing tests for your database code.

## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity
## Abstract:
### We’ve all dealt with nightmare queries: huge, twisted monsters that somehow work, despite being ugly and unmanageable. The time has come to tame these beasts, and the solution is available now, in SQL Server 2012.
New T-SQL functions offer out-of-the-box solutions for many problems that previously required complex workarounds. Paging, Running totals, Moving aggregates, YTD, and much more comes at the power of your fingertips in SQL Server 2012. The only thing you need to do is learn the syntax. And that is exactly what this session is all about: a thorough description and explanation of the syntax, and loads of demos to demonstrate how you can use all these new features.
Attend this session to boldly take SQL Server where it has never gone before!

# Deep Dive on the IoT Hub
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#543-Manchester-2016)
Event Date: 23-07-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Azure
## Speaker: Allan Mitchell
## Title: Deep Dive on the IoT Hub
## Abstract:
### When you design IoT solutions in the Azure cloud there are some things you are going to need to do.  Being able to send events to a resilient queue that can handle millions of transactions per second is fine but what do you do about security?  Surely you only want registered devices to be able to send to that queue?  What about storing details about those devices too?  Maybe we want to be able to tell where a device is located, its model and serial number.

IoT solutions very often are not a one way street.  Having devices send their data to the cloud is great but often you need the cloud to talk back to your device.  
OK so our data is in the cloud but now what?  What do we do with it?  What can we do with it?

This session is going to show you how to solve all of these things.  It is going to be heavy on demos and will build the solution in stages so nobody gets lost.  We'll use a mixture of technologies all of which are available in Azure.

Come to the session to learn more.

## Speaker: André Melancia
## Title: NSA Secrets - Hacking SQL Server
## Abstract:
### How easy is it to hack a SQL Server?
In this session we'll see a few examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some creative ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks, and other ways), escalating priviledges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), and more.
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants (Jedi level).

## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: Getting CI right for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This isn’t the dark ages any more. You’ve learned that you need to put your database in source control and you’re competent with source control systems like TFS or Git. You’ve also learned how to express your database in script form using a tool like SSDT, Flyway or Redgate.

However, you still haven’t written as many automated tests as you know you should and you aren’t convinced you’re going about it the right way. You haven’t really looked at the build functionality in VSTS yet or gotten to grips with build servers like TeamCity or Jenkins, and even if you have you aren’t sure how the process should work for SQL Server builds and tests.

In this session I’ll explain how to use tSQLt to build a suite of automated tests to give you confidence in the quality of your code. Then I’ll talk through various ways to automate your database builds and run those tests on some schedule or trigger. I’ll also discuss the pros and cons of various different approaches so that you can understand

# Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#543-Manchester-2016)
Event Date: 23-07-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Engine
## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.

# From SSMS to SSDT why and how to move your SQL database development to SSDT
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#543-Manchester-2016)
Event Date: 23-07-2016 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Ed Elliott
## Title: From SSMS to SSDT why and how to move your SQL database development to SSDT
## Abstract:
### SSMS is the love child of what was Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager and has ever since been used as the dev tool of choice for people creating and modifying database schemas and code. Whilst SSMS is a really good management tool it is not suited to modern development. Instead Microsoft has created SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) which has had a lot of attention from Microsoft in the last few years which means that it is now ready for us to use full time.

We will cover:

* How to get your databases into SSDT and critically how to get them to compile correctly.
* A tour of the SSDT features that show how T-SQL development is actually easier and how SSDT makes you more productive
* The build  deployment process so you can start concentrating on writing useful code instead of upgrade and release scripts.

If you write, debug or modify SQL Server database code and haven't yet started using SSDT full time then this session will help you get started and be productive quickly.

## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Normalization Beyond Third Normal Form
## Abstract:
### Do you believe the myths that “Third Normal Form is good enough”, or that “Higher Normal Forms are hard to understand”?
Do you believe the people who claim that these statements are myths?
Or do you prefer to form your own opinion?
If you take database design seriously, you cannot afford to miss this session. You will get a clear and easy to understand overview of all the higher Normal Forms: what they are, how to check if they are met, and what consequences their violations can have. This will arm you with the knowledge to reject the myths about higher Normal Forms. But, more important: it will make you a better designer!
