## Title: Intro to WCF Data Services and OData
## Abstract:
### Exposing your data to client applications is a common requirement across most applications; however, there are many ways to accomplish this.  Each application seems to implement it a different way which leads to inconsistency across your application spectrum.  With the release of the .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft has introduced WCF Data Services (was ADO.NET Data Services) which is a collection of classes and standards to allow you to expose your data consistently and securely to your client applications.  We'll focus on WCF Data Services in .NET 4, in which Microsoft has beefed up the offering, and also the data protocol known as OData.
