## Title: REAL WORLD REPORT SERVER PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover the best strategies to track SQL Server Reporting Services performance and the methods to improve report performance. We will cover methods of tracking report performance through sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats and other DMVs, leveraging the ReportServer catalog ExecutionLog3 view, and monitoring Reporting Services using performance monitor (perfmon). We will analyze this information through T-SQL queries in SSMS and PowerView analysis. We will also cover methods of rolling these solutions into a warehouse report using SSRS / SSIS to monitor report performance over time. We will discuss when to scale out the Report Server and when to focus on the SQL Server queries driven through SSRS report execution. 

We will cover methods of isolating Report Server performance and we will cover how to create your own SSMS Dashboard Report with KPIs on SSRS and SQL Server Performance.

This session is a must for both DBAs and report developers.
