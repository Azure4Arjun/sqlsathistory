## Title: Top 10 Clustering Dos and Don'ts
## Abstract:
### Clustering SQL Server still vexes many in one way or another.

Storage, networking, Active Directory quorum, and more are topics that come up quite often. Learn from one of the world's experts on clustering SQL Server some the most important items - both good and bad - that you need to do to be successful whether you are creating an FCI, AG, or combining both together in one solution.
