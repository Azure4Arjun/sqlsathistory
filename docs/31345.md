## Title: Introduction to PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### Are you trying to get a handle on what PowerPivot can do? Are you also interested in knowing PowerPivot's limitations? Would you like to know how to integrate PowerPivot with Sharepoint 2010? Are you a little confused about where PowerPivot "fits" in the Microsoft BI stack? Are you unsure about how DAX formulas work? This intro session is almost like a "PowerPivot for Mere Mortals", where I'll take same data from 2 sources and showcase several of PowerPivot's capabilities.
