## Title: Application Lifecycle Management for Databases
## Abstract:
### This session will deal with techniques for maintaining SQL Server databases in an orderly fashion. We will discuss design decisions that make databases easier to maintain. We will talk about code management and change control to keep the database current â€“ even in multi-user environments. We will talk about simpler, reliable deployment strategies. And we will explore testing frameworks to assure the changes are safe.  By using field proven techniques and the tools in Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio, we can ease the process of maintaining custom databases while remaining flexible enough to meet the changing needs of our organizations.
