## Speaker: Michael John
## Title: Handling catch all or sometimes queries
## Abstract:
### We have all had requirements for a procedure based upon many parameters that may or may not contain a value. These are typically seen as the code behind a search screen. The end users need to do this regularly, and they can be real performance killers.

This session will provide a number of different ways to handle "sometimes" queries, and provide techniques to make these perform faster.
