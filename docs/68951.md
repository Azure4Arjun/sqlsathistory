## Title: No future for the DBA
## Abstract:
### How does the DBA evolve to look at new tools and services beyond the database? Join me to look at how hybrid solutions and the massive Azure Data Services landscape is changing the DBA.  Teach yourself new tricks with Data Lake and Data Lake analytics.  Query and aggregate over millions of points of data.  See the power of Hybrid connectivity to deliver value and performance for reporting, BI and analytics.  Bridge the world with cosmos DB and see the death of the data warehouse with Azure SQL Data Warehouse. What, a self-tuning database, maybe I should just take a longer lunch?
