## Title: Learning R Using Fantasy Football Data
## Abstract:
### R -- it's included in SQL Server 2016. What the heck can I do with it? Why do I need to know yet another software language? How can I use it to figure out important things -- like who do I draft over who in my fantasy football league?

We'll go over the basics of R and rStudio, plus items such as:

- Installing and managing packages
- Accessing data in various formats
- Basic data visualization functions
