## Title: Running MSSQL on Mac OS - Mission Possible
## Abstract:
### Recently Microsoft has released SQL Server 2016 for Linux. It features another option option to run MSSQL on Mac OS using Docker.
Probably, you would never choose this option for your production environment but it is a good opportunity for all Mac fans to have a working database running on their MacBooks. 
In this session we will go through all options to run SQL Server on Mac OS and what development tools are available to connect and use your database.
The session will include a live demo, so you will be able to see step by step the installation process and how you can connect and use the database.
