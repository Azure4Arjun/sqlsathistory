## Title: The Jupyterian Snake Invasion: Intro to Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Azure and Beyond [VIDEO]
## Abstract:
### Python and Jupyter Notebooks have become popular with data professionals and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google. With applications in data exploration, analysis, model training, visualization, and data sharing, they've transformed how data professionals work. In conjunction with the growth of these tools, data workflows are also utilizing cloud resources for easier collaboration, access to powerful hardware, and distributed storage/computation. Join us in this interactive session for an intro to Jupyter Notebooks and Python, where they came from, when you should use them and how they are being used on the cloud today. We will walk through a basic data project using some core data packages in Python to explore a dataset and see these tools in action. By the end of this session you will be ready to join the Jupyterian Snake Invasion in data questing!

To get a head start with Jupyter, explore your first notebook with Azure notebooks:
