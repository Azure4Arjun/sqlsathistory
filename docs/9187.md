## Title: Toolkit for DAX Optimization 
## Abstract:
### How do you optimize a DAX expression? This session will introduce you to the useful tools to measure performance, gathering data to find the bottlenecks and helping you in writing new optimized versions of DAX. Starting from SQL Profiler, you will learn which events are relevant for DAX, and how to collect them in different environments (Analysis Services, Power Pivot, Power BI). We will show DAX Studio, which simplify and speed-up the data collection process, and makes it easy to find bottlenecks in storage engine and formula engine. The goal of the session is to provide you a methodology to measure performance of your DAX measures, to find the bottleneck and to identify the main reason of a performance issue.
