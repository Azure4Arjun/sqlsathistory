## Title: SQL Server Disaster Recovery and High Availability Overview
## Abstract:
### When it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with SQL Server, there are a lot of options. Most business owners (and many DBAs) lump disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) together. And while they do share some pieces, they also call for different strategies. Should you use one or more of these options? And what criteria should you use to make the choice? It’s important that you understand the decision tree that can guide you to select the right option(s) for your organization and that you can clearly explain those choices to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated. This session will give you a high-level understanding of the options, their costs and complexities, and reasons for using each of them.
