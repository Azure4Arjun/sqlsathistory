## Speaker: Chris Taylor
## Title: Database CI/CD with Containers and Azure DevOps
## Abstract:
### Containers are becoming ever popular but other than spinning one up to have a play around with the latest SQL Server 2019 CTP's new features, what else can they be used for?

In this demo heavy session we will show how Containers along with Azure DevOps can work for your CI/CD pipeline.

You will leave this session with the knowledge and ability to start creating your own bespoke SQL Server on Linux development / testing environments with automated image builds and releasing to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) along with some of the issues / pitfalls of doing so. 

Pre-Requisite:
To get the most out of this session a basic understanding of what Docker/Containers are, is recommended.

## Speaker: Hylke Peek
## Title: Common Data Service, why is it not common yet?
## Abstract:
### Within the Power Platform, there's a data store called Common Data Service (CDS). But why would you use it? You've several hundred connectors allowing you to connect to almost every type of data storage. Well, CDS is an easy way to define and centralize business logic over multiple, interconnected applications handling various types of data.

In this session, we have a good look at CDS and find his strengths and weaknesses. We'll see how to build, ingest and extract data from CDS using demos. When you're using the Power Platform and/or curious about CDS but haven't used it yet, join me at this session.

Event Date: 26-09-2020 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Nicky van Vroenhoven
## Title: A Form, a Flow and a Power BI Streaming Dataset Walk Into a Bar
## Abstract:
### This is a live demo session that demonstrates the Microsoft Power Platform of products working together to create an interactive data application.

It's good to have some form of interactivity in your presentation. Whether it's by (live) polling your audience, telling a story, asking questions during your presentation or any other way to make your presentation more interactive, doesn't really matter.
The way I started doing this was by firing some questions at the audience after I introduced myself. Although that worked pretty well, I was asking closed questions with a show of hands. 
But as I work with the Power Platform suite of products I thought it was a good idea to use some of that Power! In this session I will show you:
- Create a form with Microsoft Forms,
- Create a Power Automate flow to get the answers,
- Push them into a Power BI streaming dataset,
- And finally create a Power BI report and dashboard on that dataset to get a live view of the answers of the audience.

## Speaker: Rune Ovlien Rakeie
## Title: Easing the pain of database migrations to the cloud - Planning, process and great tools!
## Abstract:
### An essential part of migrating your application workload to the cloud is how to transfer your data securely to its new home. If you in addition want to change the underlying database system, for instance Oracle to SQL Server, it can quickly escalate to an overwhelming task. What if your application have a very high uptime requirement and your database is so large that you don’t not have a downtime window long enough to do a traditional backup/restore operation? In order to overcome these pain points we have now available, both in Azure and AWS, services and tools that alleviate these pains and brings your valuable data safely across with near-zero downtime.

In this talk we will:
- Guide you through how to set up a migration process with checks and balances
- Compare the schema analysis and conversion tools provided by AWS and Microsoft
- Compare the migration services provided by AWS and Azure
- Demonstrate near-zero-downtime migration for a live database on AWS and Azure

## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?

Event Date: 26-09-2020 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
## Abstract:
### As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, how long does the refresh take and how is it changing, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. The audience leave the session ready to start their own monitoring of all or some of the topic

# Using calculation groups in DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-963)
Event Date: 26-09-2020 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Power BI
## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: Using calculation groups in DAX
## Abstract:
### Calculation groups are the most important feature introduced in DAX after variables in 2015. By using calculation groups, you can apply transformations to existing measures without having to create new measures in the model. For example, you can define the year-over-year calculation once and apply it to all the measures you want. Yet, calculation groups can do more than that.
This session introduces the syntax of calculation groups, when they should be used and several examples of use cases. You will also learn how calculation groups work internally and what are the limits of this amazing tool.

## Speaker: Gethyn Ellis
## Title: Top 5 Skills that a DBA will need in 2020
## Abstract:
### It’s the year 2020 about ten years ago many people were writing about the demise of the DBA and how they won’t be around in ten years time. As we move into a new decade, and those ten years have passed the DBA role is still alive and kicking. Albeit, it has evolved in the last ten years and it has changed considerably since I started my career in the early 2000s.
In this session we will look at what skills you would expect a DBA to have in 2010 and compare it to what they will need in 2020. No doubt we will be covering:
•	New versions of SQL Server
•	Automation and PowerShell
•	Continuous integration
•	Cloud technology
•	Maybe some non-technical skills too
If you want to get my take on what skills a DBA needs to have in the Roaring 20s then this session is for you.

## Speaker: Simon Whiteley
## Title: Advancing Databricks - Next Level ETL
## Abstract:
### Azure Databricks has been around for a while now, and Apache Spark since 2012. You've watched a couple of demos, got a brief overview of what Databricks does and you've got a rough idea of where it fits in… but where do you go from there?

This session is that next stop. We'll start by taking a deeper look inside the spark engine, understanding what makes it tick and how it talks to data. We'll then break down some of the key features that come together to build the kind of data processing task that's changing how we think about ETL.

We'll be looking at:
 - RDDs  How data is stored
 - Schema Inference
 - Storing Metadata
 - Parameters in Notebooks
 - Integration with Data Factory

Each of these features comes together to build a single, generic notebook that can validate the rows within a dataset that meet a specific structure, and it's all driven by metadata!

We'll be doing everything in python, so a light familiarity will help but is not mandatory
