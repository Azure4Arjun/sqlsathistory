## Title: But I Want it in Excel...
## Abstract:
### As IT professionals we can create reports from SQL using  SSRS, SSMS, Business Objects, Crystal Reports or other popular tools.   How many times have we created something fantastic only to hear the CEO, CFO or sales teams say "That's great... but I want it in Excel".  Ugh!  

Instead of fighting your users, make them your partners!  Save time running reports or making small changes for users... empower the business!  You don't have to do the export-import thing!  Learn some basic techniques to interact directly with SQL to create beautiful Pivot Tables and Graphs, right from Excel.  You can even ensure the CxO will always have fresh data and eliminate sync issues with your other reports.
