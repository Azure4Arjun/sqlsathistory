## Title: Denali Ho! Exploring SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Lewis and Clark.  Stanley and Livingstone.  Armstrong and Aldrin.  Never bound by 9-to-5 TPS reports, they forged dauntlessly into uncharted territory, driven to discover, learn, and conquer the unknown.  This session will be nowhere near that exciting or dangerous, but will explore features of SQL Server that you may not know, and give you the tools to do your own discovery.  Learn about all those weird functions, undocumented procedures, and how to find and use them yourself.  We'll also cover how to "hack" SQL Server and possibly find even more interesting features...from the future!
