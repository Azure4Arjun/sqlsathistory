## Title: Tableau: Delivering Self-Serve BI
## Abstract:
### Rapid-fire visual analysis.  Ad hoc query capability.  Easy interactive dashboard building.  No, this is not going to be an hour of buzzword bingo.  This time we will actually deliver on the promise of self service BI.  Using SQL in conjunction with a visual analysis tool like Tableau we can help our users find the questions they didn't know they wanted to answer.  This session will be demo heavy and will highlight best practices in data visualization and dashboard design.
