## Title: PostgreSQL for the SQL Server Pro
## Abstract:
### PostgreSQL is a mature, robust and fast open-source database whose popularity grows with each new release. Let's take a look at the latest version of PostgreSQL, 9.3, and consider its strengths and weaknesses from an SQL DBA perspective. We'll dive right into the "why?" and look at some of the features Postgres has going for it, as well as some of its limitations. By the end, you should find Postgres operation and administration to be fairly similar to SQL Server, indefinitely configurable, and another good tool for any data pro's toolbox. 

I'll be demonstrating with Postgres 9.3 running on a CentOS 6.2 VM, if you would like to follow along, bring your own Linux box or Virtual Machine!
