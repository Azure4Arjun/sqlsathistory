## Title: Exploring the Power BI Desktop Designer
## Abstract:
### Learn why Microsoft Power BI is taking market share in the enterprise reporting tools area.

The desktop designer is an easy to use application that can mash up data from various sources and create visual reports that will dazzle your users.

Under the hood, the M-Language mashes up data from various sources into a relational data model; the x-velocity engine stores the data in an efficient column store format; and the DAX language can extend the model when necessary.

In short, the Power BI Desktop designer is a one stop place to turn mundane data into dynamic reports.
