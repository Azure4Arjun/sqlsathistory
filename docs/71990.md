## Title: SQL Server 2016 Advanced Security
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review the new enhancement to SQL Server security available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB.  These include Always Encrypted, Row-Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking as well as whatever else Microsoft has released since I've written this abstract. We'll look at how to set these features up, how to use them, and most importantly when to use them.
