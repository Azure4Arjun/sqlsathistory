## Title: Hyphenated Data Roles in Today's Information Environment
## Abstract:
### A modern Information Environment requires a wide and growing variety of disciplines, each with discrete skills that should compliment but often overlap others.  By understanding disciplines like Data Management, Acquisition, Modeling, Engineering, Science and BI Developer, Analyst, and Architect you will better understand how to work with others and how you might grow or transition into other roles.
