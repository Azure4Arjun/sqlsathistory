## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight
## Abstract:
### This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.

## Title: SQL Impossible: Restoring/Undeleting a table 
## Abstract:
### Yes, you read the title right. 
No, it's not about the usual "one table per partition" and "restore full backup then copy the data over" methods.
No, there are no 3rd party tools involved. Just you and your SQL Server. 

Yes, it's crazy. No, it's not for production purposes. And yes, that's why it's so much fun.
Prepare to dive into the world of data pages, log records, deletes, truncates and backups and how it all works together to get your table back from the endless void.

## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Attributes  Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012
## Abstract:
### The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

Event Date: 19-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... 

In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

## Speaker: Wayne Snyder
## Title: Understand/Code/Debug Many-to-Many Relationships i
## Abstract:
### Even though PowerPivot is touted as a power-user tool, you will not get far without encountering a many-to-many relationship. Analysis Services handles these automatically for dimensional models, but PowerPivot/Tabular models to do not. We will cover the topic from beginning to end and you will learn some easy concepts and rules that will allow you to recognize and repair many-to-many problems that you encounter in your models. You will learn how filter propogation works, how to cross filter, how to force filter propogation and how to optionally cause filters to propogate - giving you the results you need when your model contains many-to-many relationships.  This session will provide you with some of the skills you will absolutely need to b

# Inferred Dimension Members within MDS and SSIS 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-237)
Event Date: 19-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Reza Rad
## Title: Inferred Dimension Members within MDS and SSIS 
## Abstract:
### Combining Master Data Services with Data Warehouses, will cause some challenges in ETL Scenarios. In this session we will go through a demo of Inferred Dimension Members implementation with SSIS considering the fact that MDS keeps the single version of truth for the dimension record.
In this session you will learn how we will write back new record's data into MDS entity as an Inferred member. The staging structure of Master Data Services and Batch Processing will be used for this. Then you will learn what is the best practice to add the inferred record into Data Warehouse dimension. Updating the existing dimension member also would consider the Inferred member and apply SCD types only if this is not an inferred Member.
