## Title: How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.
