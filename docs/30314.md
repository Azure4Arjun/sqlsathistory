### Tightly integrated with SQL Server, SharePoint 2010 offers greater BI capabilities through the new PerformancePoint Service, enhanced functionality in Excel Services. This integration of the most-used collaboration and productivity portal with BI products makes SharePoint the most powerful platform for building your BI solutions.In this session, we'll use the BI tools in SharePoint 2010 including using Chart Web Part to graph lists, Excel Services to expose data via REST API, and PerformancePoint to create an interactive scorecard and dashboard. You will learn not only how to take full advantage of these tools to successfully develop your BI solutions, but also why and how BI can work for your business.
