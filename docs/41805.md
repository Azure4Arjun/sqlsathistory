## Title: SSAS Metadata Reporting for Cube Consumers and Developers
## Abstract:
### You've made that big investment in developing several (or hundreds) of SSAS cubes.  Now, how do you provide your users with information regarding cube structures, hierarchies and attributes, measures, etc.?  And what if your cube developers want to know things like which attributes in a model have specific properties set (or not set)?  During this session, we'll explore a reporting solution developed to provide SSAS metadata information to cube consumers and developers alike.  By using SSIS, the AMO object model, and SSRS, we'll build a system that gathers SSAS metadata and makes that available via a set of reports to create a catalog of cubes, drill-down reports showing dimension/hierarchy/attribute information, etc.
