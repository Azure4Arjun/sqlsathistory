## Speaker: Aaron King
## Title: A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour! 
## Abstract:
### In this presentation Aaron will cover how to collect data from multiple sources using SQL Server 2012 Integration Services (SSIS). Then he will use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to report detail on that data. After that he will use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to create a KPI. Finally he’ll present that KPI on a dashboard via a web page. The goal of this presentation is to show how seamless the Microsoft Business Intelligence products are. If you’ve only used a few of these products, you’ll appreciate seeing them together all at once. Code will be provided.
