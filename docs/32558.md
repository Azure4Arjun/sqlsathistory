## Title: Exploring SQL Server Column-Level Encryption
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 and 2008 support column-level data encryption in many ways. We will start with some of the basics and quickly move to how to use Encrypt/DecryptByKey and ByCert.

This session will include significant information that is not available in Books Online. It will also discuss Message Authentication Codes and how to use them to support efficient searches of encrypted data.
