## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: He Said - She Said:  A Telemcommuting Love Story
## Abstract:
### He's been telecommuting in some capacity or another since before he was a DBA.  For 13 years he's been able to be a productive, responsive, integral and valuable asset to my company without maintaining a physical presence within the confines of a corporate office.  She's been telecommuting for less than a year and is directing a fleet of SQL BI Professionals for a Major Microsoft partner.  

Together, let's have a conversation and discuss what has (and has not) worked for us over the years.  Let's discuss the traits of a good telecommuter as well as those attributes that may not make this the right arrangement for everyone.  We will even discuss what our companies have done over the years to not only accommodate telecommuting, but to embrace and succeed from having staff that work remotely!  

Taken from the approach of a husband and wife team with different experiences in telecommuting, this session is aimed at staff, spouses and management alike.
