## Title: Power up the Charts -- Adding code to SSRS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services provides very robust graphing and charting components. However, there are times when the features are not enough. SSRS exposes the chart and data objects and allows additional manipulation with code. This session starts with the basics, giving hints for coding and debugging, then provides some great examples influenced by production projects.
