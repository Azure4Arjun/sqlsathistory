## Title: SQL Server in Azure, One Year In
## Abstract:
### What's it like moving your SQL based application to the Cloud?  There is a lot to consider before you make the leap.  Azure VM (IaaS) or Service (PaaS)? Resource Manager or Classic Deployment, Authentication, Application Architecture, Networking, Backups, Migration Planning, Performance, Cost Estimating and Monitoring are issues that you will need to address for a successful implementation.  During this session I will cover how these issues were addressed from planning stage one year ago to a production SQL server in Azure.  Pickup tips and scripts. Learn from our mistakes and assumptions and avoid blind alleys.
