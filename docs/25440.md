In this hands on presentation, we shall be discussing some best practices that one should follow during the project life cycle from development to the production and implementation phases.
We shall be discussing the pros and cons of utilizing shared datasets, the pluses and pitfalls of utilizing embedded reports, report utilization logging, utilization of graphics and the portability of solutions from one server to another.
