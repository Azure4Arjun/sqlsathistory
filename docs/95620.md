## Title: SQL Server in the Cloud: Microsoft Azure vs Amazon Web Services (AWS)
## Abstract:
### Migrating SQL Server to the Cloud or already there? Trying to decide which of the two leading Cloud Providers is best for your SQL Server solution? Using one, but always wondered about the other? What about using both for HA/DR? On the surface, the differences aren't immediately obvious, and several offerings parallel one another. We will review the various options for deploying SQL Server in both Azure and AWS, then dig under the covers on storage and performance to ensure the solution fits your needs. This session will benefit everyone from the beginner to the advanced professional.
