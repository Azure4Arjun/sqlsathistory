## Title: SQL Server Security Basics
## Abstract:
### The past few years seem to have had more than their fair share of high-profile data breaches, not all of which were caused by sophisticated hacking attempts. This session explains basic methods for securing your SQL Server by making sure you're not leaving the proverbial front door unlocked (or in some cases, wide open). We will discuss the different levels and methods that can be used for granting and restricting rights, and the pros and cons of each. You'll learn steps you can take to design databases with securability in mind from the beginning so you can better protect your data later on down the road. We'll also demonstrate scripts that can help audit user rights and make sure logins don't have any more permissions than they need. Security doesn't have to be scary! Attend this session and gain a solid foundation to build your DBA career on.
