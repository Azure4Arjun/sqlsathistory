## Title: Designing a Data Warehouse from the Ground Up
## Abstract:
### What if you could approach any business process in your organization and quickly design an effective and optimal dimensional model using a standardized step-by-step method? In this session we'll discuss the steps required to design a unified dimensional model that is optimized for reporting and follows widely accepted best practices. We'll also discuss how the design of our dimensional model affects a SQL Server Analysis Services solution and how the choices we make during the data warehouse design phase can make or break our SSAS cubes.
