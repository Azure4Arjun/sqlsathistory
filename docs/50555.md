## Speaker: Dinesh Priyankara
## Title: On-premise database. Files in the cloud.
## Abstract:
### The responsibility over managing data files, security, availability and bearing maintenance cost is not always affordable and not easy too. Microsoft gave us a solution for this starting with SQL Server 2012, though we haven't noticed it much. But now with added enhancements, it is worth to give it a shot with SQL Server 2016, since the benefits are significant. SQL Server data files in Azure offers you several hybrid solutions by providing several benefits for data virtualization, data movement, security and availability, and any easy low cost maintenance for high-availability and elastic scaling. Join this session to discuss this.
