## Title: SQL 101: A Very Good Place To Start
## Abstract:
### We'll start with a quick tour of the Azure Data Studio before diving into the basics of T-SQL. In this interactive and demo heavy session we'll look at basic queries and filter operators as we build out some single table queries and multi table joins. We'll also cover some basic data aggregations and talk a little bit about what the SQL engine is doing under the covers to return your results as quickly as possible.
