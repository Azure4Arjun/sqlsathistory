## Title: Azure Sql PAAS: Lessons from the Real World
## Abstract:
### So you're using Azure Sql Database Platform As A Service. Now what? Without a physical machine, how do you do restore? Where are the backup files? When are service packs applied? Can service packs be rolled up thru dev to production? What's a service level and how does it impact database design? How do we encrypt, authorize, query tune, restore...?  We'll go over these questions and any others that you may have.
