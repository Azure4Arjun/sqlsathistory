## Speaker: Denys Chamberland
## Title: Azure Cosmos DB + Gremlin API in Action
## Abstract:
### Graph databases have been around in various
forms for a long time, in a wide range of data analysis from science technology
to business scenarios. However, there may still be a small pool of T-SQL
experts with graph experience, especially dealing with Gremlin traversal query language.
That's fully understandable. The session is not aimed on encouraging users to stop
using T-SQL, but rather giving them a new performing blade on their data analysis Swiss knife so to
speak. This session will start with a quick overview of new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API options
It will then expose main comparaison between T-SQL vs Gremlin, and reasons why
graph may be more beneficial.
It will then give a basic introduction of Gremlin Transversal topology in real context.
Finally a demo will cover how to create a new Azure Cosmos DB - Graph API project
from Visual Studio Code. 
1.Generating Vertex and Edges through Core 2.0 Console Application +  
2.Consuming Graph API data query in Core .2.0 Web client.
