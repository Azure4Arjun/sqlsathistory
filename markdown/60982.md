## Title: Infrastructure as Code in Azure for Data Platform People
## Abstract:
### Anything and everything in Cloud platforms like Azure can be completely automated. Infrastructure people and Developers have embraced this methodology already, time for us Data Platform professionals to learn how to fully automate deploying our infrastructure. 
In this session we will learn how to deploy Azure resources with (partial) Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Powershell. There will be a very strong emphasis on the Data Platform. Learn how to create reusable templates so you can create Production/UAT/Test/Development environments, or create Proof of Concept environments with automated tests quickly.
