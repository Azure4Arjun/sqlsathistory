## Title: Azure Databricks - managed Spark cluster as a service
## Abstract:
### Have you ever imagined throwing away all of the index maintanance, deadlocks, page files and database micro-management, but keeping the same query performance? Imagine a tool where you can easily cooperate with a Python/Scala/Java developer or Python/R data scientist. Imagine a tool where you can do not only end-to-end ETL but also machine learning, stream processing or graph analysis. Imagine Spark Databricks.
