### With a lot of companies looking to the cloud for cost savings, it helps to know what the differences are between on premises and cloud installations of your IT services. In this session, we'll take a look at SQL Server Reporting Services and the feature differences between deploying in the cloud, and deploying on premises. We'll look at different options for where you can deploy your reports as well. Also, Shannon Lowder will help with the associated costs of each solution, as well as preparing you for some of the gotchas you'll face as you move to the cloud today.
