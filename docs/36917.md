## Title: Power BI API
## Abstract:
### With the release of the Power BI Preview, last year, Power BI is now also accessible via an API. Although (at this moment) the API is limited, it provides the basic operations which can be used for real-time dashboarding scenarios. During this session I will show the possibilities of the API and how it can be integrated with other services, like Stream Analytics and AzureML, to provide real time dashboard for realistic IoT scenarios.
