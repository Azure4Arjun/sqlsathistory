## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: PowerShell Toolmaking with Advanced Functions and Script Modules
## Abstract:
### Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that youâ€™ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting. This session will NOT be a deep dive into any one of the previously listed topics. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended. All code shown during this presentation will be made available on GitHub.
