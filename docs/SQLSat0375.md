# Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#375---Silicon-Valley-2015)
Event Date: 28-03-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 4- Development
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)
## Abstract:
### In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.

# Getting your message across?  A practical guide to using charts  graphs!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#375---Silicon-Valley-2015)
Event Date: 28-03-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 3- Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Dan Bulos
## Title: Getting your message across?  A practical guide to using charts  graphs!
## Abstract:
### There are many books and articles on how to design a dashboard or create a pretty chart. But how do you know which graphical representation is the right one for your data?  What kind of chart will answer the right business question?  Should you use a line, bar, or pie chart? (Yes, even a pie chart.  Stephen Few is not always correct in a business context.)  When should you use multiple series on a chart versus using small multiples?  What is the best way to show contribution to the whole?  Why would you mix a line and bar chart?  

This session will take a practical approach not theoretical one.  How to give your users and management what they are looking for in a way that balances information content vs. visual impact.  A visualization that not only answers the business questions but draws the eye to the most important aspects of the data.

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Achieving Peak Performance from your Virtual SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized by now, but are they running at their absolute peak performance? How can you tell? When properly configured and maintained, a virtualized SQL Server will be at least as fast as the system that it came from, if not better. If not properly configured, silent performance killers can wreck your virtualization experience. This session will give you tips and tricks to maximize performance while giving you talking points so you can convince your infrastructure engineers to design the virtualization stack your way. This session goes deep into the architecture and methodology for squeezing the best possible performance from your virtualized SQL Server, and includes valuable tips on topics such as host-level over-commitment, storage performance, In-memory OLTP, and more!

# MEANINGLESS, BUT CONSISTENT: DATABASE TRUTH VS. CORRECTNESS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#375---Silicon-Valley-2015)
Event Date: 28-03-2015 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 6- Bonus Track
## Speaker: Fabian Pascal
## Title: MEANINGLESS, BUT CONSISTENT: DATABASE TRUTH VS. CORRECTNESS
## Abstract:
### You're a SQL Server ace: your ability to squeeze everything from SQL and your performance tuning skills are unparalleled, but do you know what your tables really mean and, therefore, what queries make sense and whether the results are correct and their interpretations sensible?

This is a critical part of data fundamentals, the grasp of which is poor. It is a subject usually neither much covered in education, nor part of job requirements and industry dialogue, yet can defeat the entire purpose of your DBMS expertise. 

This presentation fills this gap. It covers the following: 

* Meaning, business rules and table interpretations;
* Types of business rule;
* Meaning and database truth;
* Business rules, integrity constraints and database consistency;
* DBMS and user reponsibilities.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Automating Your Database Deployments
## Abstract:
### Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking. We'll discuss methods that take the stress out of the process by ensuring that you practice your deployments using continuous integration before you ever get near production. Automating the deployment and testing processes through various pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment.

## Title: Practical Machine Learning with Azure ML and Revolution R
## Abstract:
### Over years, machine learning has emerged as a key pillar of data science. Predictive analytics, data mining, even modern inferential statistics rely heavily on machine learning methods. However; the ever growing hype and in many cases overinflated expectations have led to a rather superficial understanding of the "Whats", Whens, and Hows" of machine learning in mainstream businesses.

The goal of this talk is to deliver a pragmatic view of key ingredients common across any machine learning approach and demonstrate how core machine learning tasks can be facilitated and streamlined using the Microsoft's latest ventures into the world of advanced analytics: Azure Machine Learning and Revolution R. 

We will look at machine learning experiment design, data exploration and preparation, feature engineering, feature and model selection, evaluation and interpretation of test results. We will also provide a very brief review of the most successful machine learning models.

## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage For the DBA
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

## Title: Data Quality:  Boosting Software Performance and Business Profit
## Abstract:
### If "Data is the Lifeblood of Modern Business," then most businesses are walking corpses with sludge in their veins, because 10% to 25% of all data records in the average enterprise are wrong.  Until the dramatic problems of Data Quality Management are addressed, SQL can never fulfill its original promise to eliminate application "silos", enable systems to communicate and provide useful, actionable information to the modern business.  I believe that we are on the cusp of a revolution in Data Quality that is even greater in scope and impact than the revolution in manufacturing quality that began over 40 years ago.  Businesses that make the transition will survive and thrive.  Those that don't will finally stop shambling about and lay down to die.What is this revolution in Data Quality?  How can you be a part of it (and avoid the headman's ax)?!?  This presentation will change the way you think about your jobs as Database Administrators and Application Developers.

## Speaker: Arnie Rowland
## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.
## Abstract:
### I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.

# True tales of “small-shop” web analytics data with SQL and SSAS

## Speaker: Audrey Carstensen
## Title: True tales of “small-shop” web analytics data with SQL and SSAS
## Abstract:
### It doesn’t take a big company to make big data!  Web analytics data can come from many sources and be very unruly, and the web world is full of people who want insights at their fingertips.  However, a 40 person company doesn’t have the resources for a large team of technical analysts.  This is a case study on maximum insights with a relatively small number of technical people – maybe only one! We’ll walk through taking multiple sources of data (some with millions of rows daily) and converting them into a usable source of insights for the non-technical user.
