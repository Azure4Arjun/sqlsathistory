## Title: Common SQL Server Mistakes and How to Correct Them
## Abstract:
### Making mistakes is natural, but learning from them and avoiding them in the future takes effort. There’s no substitute for experience or the shared wisdom of others to help you learn what mistakes to avoid and how to correct them. In this full-day workshop, Tim will share with you a ton of what he’s learned over the years from working and consulting at multiple Fortune-level companies. You’ll hear about real-world environments he has worked on where there was a high impact from administrators making mistakes in how SQL Server was configured and administered. We will cover key topics such as backups, recovering from disasters, database maintenance, consistency checks, security reviews, installation best practices, and monitoring and troubleshooting performance issues. By the end of the day you’ll be comfortable with your ability to support SQL Server because you will know what you need to do and have a checklist of items to take home to make sure your SQL Server is configured properly.
