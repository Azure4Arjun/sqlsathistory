## Title: Unlock the Power of the SSISDB for Dynamic Package Runtime
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will be demonstrating how to leverage the SSISDB to change SSIS Package parameters at runtime using just T-SQL. This strategy makes it easier when deploying packages to both QA and production since things like connection strings, file names, and destination table names can change based on the environment you are in. We will show how to change all these features dynamically at runtime, so that you can deploy the package once, and configure it on the fly with just T-SQL.
