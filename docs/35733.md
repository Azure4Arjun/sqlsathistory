## Title: How to build an IT operations expert
## Abstract:
### My thesis in the Master of IT management program was about the life of IT operations people and how they learn. 

Specifically I worked on the following three research questions:
1) What is the difference between a normal IT operations professional and a true expert
2) How can you make your IT operations professionals better
3) What can you do to make your experts thrive

Come and hear about my results and how to make your IT operations professionals grow
