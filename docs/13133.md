## Title: Deadlocks. Everything that developer needs to know.
## Abstract:
### It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunately in a real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". And we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: catch, analyze, fix. But in practice the process can be challenging and can require different types of analysis. In this session we will analyse and solve as many deadlock as we can in 60 min.
