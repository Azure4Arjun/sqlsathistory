## Title: Bridge Analytics and Developer Worlds with Power BI and PowerApps
## Abstract:
### One of the Power BI most prominent strengths is that itâ€™s a part of the much broader Microsoft Data Platform that spans various on-premises and cloud offerings for data storage, processing, and analysis. Join me to learn how to integrate Power BI with PowerApps and discover exciting new possibilities that redefine the meaning of a report. During this entirely hands-on, no-slides session, I'll walk you through the steps to implement a popular report requirement for writeback, that Power BI doesn't natively support.
