## Speaker: Hope Foley
## Title: Consulting The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 
## Abstract:
### Ted Krueger will join Hope in presenting this session. Consulting is a mystical career path that is often questioned: should I do it, can I do it and why should I do it? Come join us on a discussion of the Pros and Cons to consulting with an emphasis on SQL Server and Microsoft Technologies. We'll field questions with real world experiences. Once you leave this open floor session, you'll be able to make better choices in your own professional development and how consulting may or may not effect it.
