## Title: Power BI For Master Data Management
## Abstract:
### Have you ever come across such business scenarios when you feel you have challenged your Reticular Activating System to find an “out-of-the-box solution for Master Data Management in your Reporting System”? Have you ever thought about a self-service BI system, designed and customized, only for your Master Data? Often times, in IT industry executives neglect the fact that 30% of their data visualization contains Master Data. 

Integrating Master Data Services with Power BI, and presenting analytics on top only Master Data, can provide a high-end leverage to your organization. Whether it is a location model, a product model, a customer model etc., executives can highly be insightful from a report that contains all master data domains consolidated with a better visualization. Using individual subscription views from Master Data Services(SQL Server 2017) in Power Query, and utilizing all the cross references entities across models in MDS – can lead to a great one page report via Power BI.
