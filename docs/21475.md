## Title: Using ioMemory to leverage Buffer Pool Extension and In-memory OLTP capability with Microsoft
## Abstract:
### Leveraging Buffer Pool Extension and In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2014 with Fusion’s ioDrive2 product line increases database performance by allowing solid state storage to exist alongside DRAM. Fusion’s memory-like performance helps reduce costs by enabling organizations to scale with NAND flash versus DRAM.
