## Title: Social Networking Is Alive!!!
## Abstract:
### Social Networking and Media is all over the news today. Did you see that on Facebook? Johnny 5 said what on Twitter? Can you believe Susie moved to that company? Do any of those sound familiar? No?  Never heard of Twitter or LinkedIn? Have no fear, this is the session for you!  Social networking can be a very confusing and intimidating place. What makes it even worse, is when you have no clue even where to start.  In this session, we will go over different facets of Social Networking and Media and how you can use them to enhance not only your personal lives but just as importantly, your professional one. For example, did you know you can get help from some of  the top minds in the SQL Server profession by using the #SQLHELP hash tag for free? We will show you how! We'll be covering that and more using Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.
