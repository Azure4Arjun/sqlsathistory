## Title: Creating Dynamic Packages
## Abstract:
### In a perfect world an ETL solution would only have to import data from a single file that always had the same name deliver it to a single already existing table.  Unfortunately this case is the exception rather than the rule.  How can you use SSIS to: 
1.    Iterate through all files in a folder and import their content into SQL
2.    Dynamically create and name table based on a data source 
3.    Dynamically create a T-SQL statement at runtime based on run time conditions
This session focuses on how to create SSIS packages that can change to meet runtime events dynamically based on the environment.
Each attendee will leave with the knowledge and toolset necessary to:
1.      Use expressions within SSIS packages
2.      Use variables to dynamically create SQL statements
3.      Configure custom dynamic logging
4.      Use package configurations and parameters and environments to make packages more portable at execution
5. 	Replace dynamic SQL using expressions in SSIS
