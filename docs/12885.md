## Title: Managing your reporting services environment
## Abstract:
### This session will investigate some of the tables and views of the reporting services database in SQL Server 2008  2008 R2.  We will then go on to demonstrate how to build a long term reporting repository for tracking report performance, report use, and subscription results.  Finally we will review a few reports that can be built from this data to make the whole process a bit easier.
