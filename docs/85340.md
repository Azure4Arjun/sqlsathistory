## Title: Everlasting Issues with Temporary Tables and tempdb
## Abstract:
### Tempdb has been a source of configuration confusion since the very first version of SQL Server. Each SQL Server instance only has one tempdb database used by all users in all databases. In this session, we’ll look at all the different uses of tempdb and how to configure your tempdb to support them. We’ll look at all the different kinds of temporary tables and see when you should use each type. We’ll talk about the difference between global and local temp tables, table variables and work tables. We’ll explore the various tools available that let you monitor the use (and abuse) of your tempdb database and we look at some best practice guidelines for how to keep your tempdb as healthy as possible.
