## Speaker: Ed Pearson
## Title: Enabling Real Time Analytics through Azure
## Abstract:
### How do we deliver more business value to data hungry customers who constantly want more and faster? How do we enable automation to deliver complex solutions that provide consistent data to empower a self-service BI environment?

I will demonstrate how our analytics team is leveraging Azure and cloud-native technologies to ensure we can meet the demands of our customer base, and in turn, deliver faster and higher volume results. 

My presentation will walk through an end-to-end solution – from data acquisition using Azure Logic Apps; data transformation via Azure Data Factory; and ending with reporting in PowerBI.
