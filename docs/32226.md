## Title: Take Your Automation Script to the Next Level
## Abstract:
### How can PowerShell take SQL Server Automation to the next level?  PowerShell with the help of the SMO (Server Management Objects) allows a script to interact with the operation system and SQL Server at the same time.  In this session we will cover the basics of PowerShell and the SMO object model.  Then review a number of scripts that demonstrate the power of PowerShell when automating SQL Server tasks and can be used as building blocks for further automation.
