## Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Manhandling Parallelism
## Abstract:
### In today's multi-core-driven world, query performance is very much determined by how well you're taking advantage of the processing power at your disposal. In this session you will learn how to take full advantage of parallelism, from a developer's point of view. After a quick terminology review and technology refresher the session will go deep, covering T-SQL patterns that allow certain queries to scale almost linearly across your multi-core CPUs. Not all T-SQL queries can go parallel, so you'll also learn to watch for those things that can restrict the query optimizer's decisions. Along the way you'll learn to manipulate costs and row goals, challenge generally accepted tuning practices, and take complete control of your parallel queries.
