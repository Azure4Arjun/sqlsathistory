## Title: Python with SQL:  A Winning Combination
## Abstract:
### You want to learn Python but don't know where to start?  You already know SQL, and data wrangling is one of the most critical use cases for Python.  Why not start with that?  Good news! Python provides many ways to use good old SQL as a first class query and data manipulation language.  In this session, we'll show you how easy it is to use SQL with Python to query non relational and relational database data, to load data from SQL Server, and write it back.  It's so easy, you'll feel like a Python pro before you know it!
