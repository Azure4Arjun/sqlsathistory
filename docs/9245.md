## Title: SQL Server Dos and Don'ts: Keys to DBA Nirvana
## Abstract:
### Bad Windows builds? No HA? No backups? SQL Server considered the non-mission critical platform yet you have hundreds of instances? Over the years I've seen most, if not all of, the good, bad, and ugly of being a SQL Server DBA from being both a full time employee as well as a consultant. If you want to skip 20 years of ups and downs, come to this session to hear how you can be a better DBA for your SQL Server deployments, avoid pitfalls, and hopefully laugh at a few of my misadventures over the course of my career.
