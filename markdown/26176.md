## Title: TSQL Road Less Traveled: APPLY
## Abstract:
### Spend some time with TheSQLGuru as we learn about and explore the many uses and features of this seldom-used but rather powerful addition to TSQL. It has the ability to allow for elegant set-based solutions to some classes of problems as well as what some consider a clean coding pattern. It also has some nuances that you need to make sure you are aware of as you add this keyword to your TSQL toolbox.
