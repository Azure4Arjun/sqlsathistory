## Title: Women in Technology: Identifying and Understanding Gender Bias  Inequality
## Abstract:
### Gender Bias is something we're all guilty of.  It's typically unconscious and often stems from long held misperceptions about women  job responsibilities.  We'll learn how to identify gender bias when we see it.  We'll discuss why it's important, how it affects our work, decision making, hiring, etc.  We'll discuss strategies for how  both men and women can combat this at work  in our every day lives.  This session is about developing positive solutions to a problem that often goes undiscussed.
