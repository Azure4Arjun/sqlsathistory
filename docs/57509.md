## Title: T-SQL Errors and Problems and Data Meaning
## Abstract:
### You see it all the time, someone asks a question about how to fix an error like "Subquery returns more than one value" and an immediate answer is given that fixes the syntax. But is that the right fix or are there other things you need to consider when fixing syntax errors in SQL?

I am going to show why it is also important to consider the meaning of the results when fixing issues with a query and why syntax is never enough when querying a database. Along the way I will show you some common errors and problems and the multiple ways they can be fixed and how to evaluate what the correct fix would be.
