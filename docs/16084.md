## Title: Nested Sets model for Trees  Hierarchies 
## Abstract:
### Most newer SQL programmers use the adjacency list model for Trees  Hierarchies in their DDL. This is not a relational approach and experienced programmers use the Nested Sets model. However, they do not know all of the programming idioms for the method. That is what this session is about.
