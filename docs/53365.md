## Speaker: Niels Berglund
## Title: Real-Time Operational Analytics
## Abstract:
### It used to be that if you want to do analysis of data that is stored in SQL Server, you had to extract the data into a data ware-house or something similar, and run you analysis there. The downside with that is the time it takes from the time of insertion into the transaction store until the data is available in the DW. In this session we will see how we can use SQL Server 2016 to do real time analytics against your OLTP database.
