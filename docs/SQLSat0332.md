## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: SQL Server Features That Will Blow Your Mind!
## Abstract:
### How many lines of code does it take to generate a running total?  How would you find a value in the next row of data - without using a cursor or loop?  How can you efficiently store rows of data with a lot of optional fields, and how can you quickly find which of those rows have values?  And how can you eliminate locking without resorting to dirty reads?  SQL Server has answers for all of these questions, and none requires more than a few lines of code.

## Speaker: Gina Meronek
## Title: Power to the Prototypes: Using Power BI to Deliver Better SQL Reporting
## Abstract:
### As SQL Server professionals, we have a complicated relationship with Excel-based tools. Rather than broadly paint Excel as friend or foe, why not learn how Power Query  Power Pivot can improve the SQL Server solutions you develop? In this session, we’ll cover scenarios where Power Query and Power Pivot can be leveraged to get the most from the proof-of-concept phase of your reporting, ETL,  analytics projects. Learn how Power Query can help you test the quality of your data well before the production ETL is deployed. We’ll also cover how Power Pivot can help you visualize the structure and granularity of your data, and why it’s the perfect “gateway drug” for SSAS cube development.  If you've ever had a BI project fall flat because “We didn't know what we didn't know” or want to avoid delivering a hundred reports when the data merits ten, this is the session for you!

## Speaker: Greg Beaumont
## Title: A New Frontier of Government  Open Data: What it Means to You  Microsoft BI Tools
## Abstract:
### I am following up to a 2011 SQL Saturday presentation that I gave on this same topic.  Open Data is freely available for everyone to use and republish as they wish without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.  The United States Government has a dedicated open data portal at Data.gov, and there are now hundreds if not thousands of open data portals from countries, provinces, counties, companies, and cities.  Now that there is open data available for you to reach out and grab, what comes next?  I'll review the maturation process of the open data movement, some examples of what's been done with it by myself and others, and how Microsoft BI tools are prime for mashing it up to make it usable and understandable.  Now that open data is widely available, the benefits it has to offer governments, companies, academia, and individual citizens will continue to expand exponentially.  We now have the information, so let's get going with the integration!

Event Date: 25-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Mark Vaillancourt
## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
## Abstract:
### Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

# Pseudo-Constants in SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#332-Minnesota-2014)
Event Date: 25-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DEV 2
## Speaker: Riley Major
## Title: Pseudo-Constants in SQL
## Abstract:
### You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

# Scary Things A Database Owner Can Do
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#332-Minnesota-2014)
Event Date: 25-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 1
## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: Scary Things A Database Owner Can Do
## Abstract:
### So you've setup your new SQL Server instance and it’s time to start adding databases to it.  You followed security best practices at the instance level, but what about security within each database?  Is that something you can control?  Well, if like me, you work in a shop that mostly purchases software, then having users with database owner permissions is a reality, and likely not one you can change.  But members of the db_owner role can only make changes that would adversely impact their own databases, right?  Think again. During this session we’ll review some common database level settings and actions which can have a negative impact across the entire instance.  We’ll discuss ways to mitigate these risks and monitor for their occurrence.  Come learn how to not let poor choices made by a database owner impact your entire instance.

## Speaker: Frank Gill
## Title: Designing a Restore Strategy
## Abstract:
### Do you back up your databases? If the answer is yes (and I really hope it is), do you test your restores? If a table gets dropped at 1:53PM, can you restore the database to 1:52PM using log backups? Can you use the WITH STANDBY parm to apply log backups to a read-only copy of a database? For the answers to these questions and a whole lot more about database restores, plus some nifty scripts, join me for this presentation.

## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter
## Abstract:
### Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns?  Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why?  Did you know that these Datatype Choices can be a real performance killer?  Attend this session, learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal.  Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now!  When you leave, you should be able to explain why datatype choices matter to your colleagues, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.

Event Date: 25-10-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI 1
## Speaker: Terry Bunio
## Title: How do I create an automated ETL test suite ??
## Abstract:
### There are many automated test frameworks available for different types of applications, but Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data movement applications seem to lack an efficient and easy to use automated test framework. 
We will review how to create automated tests with a data driven approach by showing how the tests self-generate based upon the data in the Information-Model schema in SQL Server and 4 slender custom tables that define the field data mapping between the source and target.
The last half of the session will be a demonstration of the tests to illustrate how they execute. To do this we will quickly review the functionality of the tSQLt test framework and the stored procedure code we created that generates the tests. We will review the considerable functionality in tSQLt that makes ETL testing and database testing easy and efficient. 
We will execute hundreds of tests in the short time during the presentation.

## Speaker: Ted Krueger
## Title: Query Tuning for Developers
## Abstract:
### As a seasoned DBA, we often forget the basics of query tuning may be an area others haven’t been introduced to. Tuning can be a mystery for developers and DBAs that are starting out with SQL Server. Each operation and its cost can lead to lengthy research escapades, determining if the work is even worth the time to attempt a change in the overall execution plan. This session is going to discuss the basics of tuning; however, we can't end there. The second half of the session, the discussion portion, will focus on the key operations in the execution plan. The overall goal of the session is to take away knowledge on how to start with a query and use execution plans to refine it and turn it into a finely tuned process.

## Title: SSIS Deployment and Configuration
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to a new way of deploying SSIS projects and packages and configuring them at run time.  These new features include the project deployment model and the Integration Services Catalog.  
This session will discuss the details of these features including:
•	Configuring package properties using SSIS Parameters
•	Project level connection managers
•	Deployment to the Integration Services Catalog
•	Creating environments and using environment variables
•	Executing packages in different environments
Come and see how easy it is to deploy and configure the same SSIS packages to run in multiple environments.

## Title: Performing a SQL Server Health Check
## Abstract:
### How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  If you say never, I'm not surprised - many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have many gaping holes.  It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that have too much!)

Come learn how to use freely available tools to check your servers for basic issues like backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy and indexing.  If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Title: Secure Your SQL Server Instance Without Changing Any Code
## Abstract:
### Secure your SQL Server infrastructure and your Windows installations to enhance resiliency and minimize exposure to attacks -- all without touching a single line of code! In this session you will learn about Transparent Data Encryption, IPSec, Database Firewalls, Contained Databases and many other technologies that help you lock down your systems and close attack vectors. This talk puts great emphasis on the biggest threat to your database: SQL injection, offering many remediation techniques to prevent such attacks. During the demos, you will learn techniques to deal with vendors who require SA accounts to run their applications. Protect your SQL Servers without having to wait for your Developers or Vendors to make changes!
