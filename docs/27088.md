## Title: PowerQuery and M
## Abstract:
### Getting the right data in the right format is critical for all data analytics. PowerQuery helps you to achieve this. Using the GUI to do this is one thing. To use the tool to its full potential you want to use M, the language behind PowerQuery. In this demo rich session we will start simple by doing some data transformations in the GUI. We will then dive into M to get to the real powerful stuff.
