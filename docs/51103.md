## Speaker: Seth Valdetero
## Title: From Dev to Deployment: DevOps for Your Mobile App
## Abstract:
### Visual Studio Team Services has some new integrations for your Xamarin mobile apps. We#39;ll be taking an existing mobile app and adding Continuous Integration to ensure your app builds, connecting to build agents, and Continuous Deployment to HockeyApp. We will also discuss another CI/CD service, Bitrise, which has its own build agents. With all of the different platforms and integration points, there#39;s no reason why these steps should be manual. Learn how to leverage your existing Microsoft tools and subscriptions to get your app out faster and with less human interaction.
