## Title: Learn to Love Lisp: A look into Clojure
## Abstract:
### Clojure is a dialect of Lisp. It's a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multi-threaded programming. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. Though it's functional, it was designed to be practical, and features specific constructs for mutability such as software transactional memory (STM). We'll talk about the core features of Clojure, some of the fundamental ideas behind functional programming, and how to develop "live" with the REPL.
