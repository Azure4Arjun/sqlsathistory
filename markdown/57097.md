## Speaker: Janis Griffin
## Title: Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!
## Abstract:
### One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type information it holds and how you can use it to analyze performance issues.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.
