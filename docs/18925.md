## Title: How to properly gather performance counter data using Windows PowerShell
## Abstract:
### We DBA´s know how important it is to collect performance data. In this session, I will show to you how to properly use the native Get-Counter PowerShell cmdlet to get all information you need from your servers. It has never been as easy to collect performance counter data and save it to a CSV file or a SQL Server table for baselining and later analysis. You may be thinking "But I don’t know nothing about PowerShell and explicitly using .NET classes in my code". Don’t worry; you don’t need to know this to collect counters. Although this is a 100-level session, you’ll be producing 400-level results and your scripts will scale as the number of servers increase, because we’ll use asynchronous collection and processing. And better yet, we’ll schedule all of it. All this using native PowerShell cmdlets and a minimal amount of script code.
