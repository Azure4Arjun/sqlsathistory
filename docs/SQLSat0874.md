# T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-874)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 11:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Shehab El-Najjar
## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers
## Abstract:
### To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Data Overview and Manipulation – T-SQL, R, Python
## Abstract:
### In a real data mining or machine learning project, you spend more than half of the time on data preparation and data understanding. The R language is extremely powerful in this area. The Python language is a match. Of course, you do work with data by using T-SQL. You will learn in this session how to get data understanding with really quickly prepared basic graphs and descriptive statistics analysis. You can do advanced data preparation with many data manipulation methods available out of the box and in additional packages from R and Python. After this session, you will understand what tasks data preparation involves, and what tools you have in SQL Server suite for these tasks.

# When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-874)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 13:20:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Erland Sommarskog
## Title: When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.

## Title: AI in Power BI
## Abstract:
### AI and Power BI? Yes! 
Azure Cognitive Service comes with a set of powerful, pretrained models for intelligent applications. At this point, four of them are exposed in Power BI: language detection, sentiment scoring, key phrase extraction, and image tagging. These models can be used on textual data or images.
During the 60 minutes of the sessions we will find out together the answer to the questions WHAT, HOW and the most important one, WHY.
Fun is guaranteed :)

# How to be polite with databases when going serverless
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-874)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 13:20:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Ivan Čuljak
## Title: How to be polite with databases when going serverless
## Abstract:
### Like it wasn't enough that just anyone could use an ORM and start molesting a database, nowadays just anyone can use serverless and communicate with a database... and use ORM...
First of all, we're gonna focus on how to communicate with a database from your serverless system presuming that there aren't any parallel requests to the database. In that way, we'll first polish cold starts, memory/CPU consumption, and basically everything we need to worry about now when we're not running our code on servers with 10+ cores, and tens of GB of RAM.
Once we're done with the first task, we'll end up with something that can quickly and effortlessly communicate with our database. Which is perfect, except in cases where we handle thousands or more of parallel requests to the database which isn't scalable as serverless is.
That brings us to our second task- making sure our serverless system won't DDoS our databases :)
Come and find out how to approach this problems ;)

# SQL Server Data Science: Python or R?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-874)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 14:30:00 - Track: AIML Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: SQL Server Data Science: Python or R?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 brought support or the R language. SQL Server 2017 added a new language to the list, the Python language. Both languages target advanced analytics scenarios, popularly known as data science. For a SQL Server professional who wants to move in the data science area, the first question is which language to choose. In this presentation, you will learn basics about both languages. We will try to solve the same problem with both languages. This way, through demos with a lot of explanation, you will realize the most important differences between the two competing languages. You will understand which one is more appropriate for you to start with.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Damir Bulic
## Title: Lightning-fast management of cloud and legacy databases, breaking vendor lock-in
## Abstract:
### With the infrastructure increasingly moving to the cloud, developers are stuck with legacy tools, suboptimal for the new workflows. Current reality is slow and unreliable web applications bundled using Electron - or native applications that look like they are made 20 years ago.
We have started from scratch, imagining the ideal database manager for modern times. UI responds to your actions in less than 0.1 seconds and your data stays in the cloud. Connection switching is instant and the workspace is preserved between devices and application restarts.
A sneak peek - state of the art SQL code translation solution - removing vendor lock-in.
This is a work-in-progress report, detailing why it's so hard to get right and why does it take so long to make something seemingly simple - not a sales talk, not a self-congratulatory talk.
