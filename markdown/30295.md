## Title: Virtualization Basics for the SQL Guru
## Abstract:
### This session will cover Microsoft Virtualization technologies in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (Hyper-V). I will cover how to use the tools in both environments to create and manage Virtual Machines (VMs) and explain when to use Windows 7 versus Server 2008 R2. Lastly, I will show how to configure your system for multi-boot using Boot to VHD. If you have a USB hard drive with 10 GB of free space, I will also give you an unactivated VHD with Server 2008 R2 installed and ready to go with Hyper-V.
