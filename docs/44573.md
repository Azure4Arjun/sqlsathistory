## Speaker: Jemini Joseph
## Title: SSIS Factory
## Abstract:
### Assume you have 100's of packages already developed and running in production. How long it will take to find the package that affect a particular table? Want to automate the search through all packages instead of opening each of them manually and checking them? Can it be more interesting if the conversion of those 2008 packages to 2012/2014 and deploy it to the new SSISDB using project deployment model? You can do it through C# (or VB) code using SSIS SDK with your C# scripting skills that you use in SSIS packages.  You can also create new SSIS packages to load text/excel files that receive from a vendor even if you don't know the file structure. Let's have some fun..
