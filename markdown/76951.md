## Title: Cloudy DBA, Amazon (AWS) and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google or whatever else out there) is a reality now and for most of the organizations question is not "if", it is "When". 

Cloud has and will continue to transform DBA's role from tactical to strategic. We will start our session with a quick discussion about Cloudy DBA and cloud computing fundamentals. 

After that we will dive deep into Amazon and explore different options for running SQL Server database in AWS. We will compare available options, evaluate their differences and suitability for different workloads. We will also cover cloud migration approaches, connectivity, AD Authentication, backup and recovery, performance, monitoring, HA/DR, security, compliance, licensing and related best practices.
