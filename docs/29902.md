## Speaker: Darrell Burns
## Title: Movin Uptown: Migrating from Access to SQLServer
## Abstract:
### Darrell will be describing an import classification application initially developed entirely in Access and then converted to SQL Server 2008, leaving the Access UI intact.  Darrell will demonstrate both the before and after versions, showing how he migrated the Access macros and VBA code to SQL stored procedures, and what he learned along the way. This topic should be of particular interest to: Database designers, Access developers, SQLServer application developers, and anybody considering an Access-to-SQLServer migration. Some of the key points of interest: Data-driven application design, SQLServer vs Access performance advantages, How to use pass-through SQL, Leveraging the power of SQLServer, Access design considerations.
