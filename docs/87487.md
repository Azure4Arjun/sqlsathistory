## Title: Data Meaning in Database Design, Analysis, and Reporting
## Abstract:
### Most training for databases ignores the single most critical element for successful collection and analysis of data, the meaning of the data itself. 
This session explores how meaning affects results and why assuming a query is right just because it ran creates problems for the decision makers using the data results.a
We will look at how it impacts database design. We will examine how it affects ETL and Big Data analyses. We will look at complex reporting queries and how incorrect results can harm the business.
