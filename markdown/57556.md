## Title: Kafka For .NET Developers
## Abstract:
### Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system which can scale out to handle millions of messages per second.  In this talk, we will cover the basics of this powerful system, including general architectural and design principles.  We will also build a .NET project which uses Kafka to produce and consume messages quickly and efficiently.
