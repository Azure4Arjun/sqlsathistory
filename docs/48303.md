## Title: Hostile Takeover
## Abstract:
### In the spirit of Tim Ford's year long Entry Level Challenge, what do you do when given a SQL Server to manage? This presentation will walk you through how to gain access to a SQL Server you have never seen before, what are the basic tools to use to collect inventory information, and what scripts I use to best determine the "health" of the server.
