## Title: Dashboard Creation with the new Power BI
## Abstract:
### Creating dashboards just became a lot easier. The Power BI Designer is a dedicated development tool for creating Power BI dashboards. The designer integrates many of the tools you may already be familiar with (Power Pivot, Power Query, Power View) but in a more accessible way to businesses. The Power BI Designer allows you to acquire the necessary data, create relationships between objects and then create impressive charts, maps, graphs that can then be deployed and viewed from any device, anywhere.
