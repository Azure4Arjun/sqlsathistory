## Title: Slinging data with SQL Server Replication
## Abstract:
### Performance problems getting you down? Replication may be the solution. 

SQL Server replication is a native SQL Server component used to move data from one server to another, and sometimes back again. It's most popular use case is to offload reporting from bogged down OLTP servers - it can also be used for scale out solutions, transforming data, consolidating data, moving data closer to its consumers, proving high availability solutions and disaster recovery.
