## Title: Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, youâ€™ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!
