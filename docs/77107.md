## Speaker: Josh Burgin
## Title: Real-time Smart Home Analytics
## Abstract:
### There are two types of homes... smart homes and dumb homes.  Is your home smart or dumb?  If its smart, how are you analyzing its impact?  We'll do our best to answer that question.  The main inspiration for this session was trying to answer the question "How many times a week does my daughter asks the Echo to play Ed Sheeran?".  In this session we'll cover how one can answer both real-time and historical questions about their smart home utilizing a lambda architecture in Azure Data Services.  The data is easy to grasp.  The reference architecture and implementation are pretty straight forward as well.
