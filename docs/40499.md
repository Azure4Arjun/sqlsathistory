## Title: When SQL is not enoughâ€¦ there it comes Elasticsearch
## Abstract:
### Elasticsearch doubled its popularity during the last year and this is just one of the signs that something good is happening there. Yet this DB stays far behind the usual suspects like SQL Server and MySQL but there are areas where different technologies fit much better. One of these is complex and real-time search.
Elasticsearch builds on the top of the well-known Apache Lucene but is designed to easily scale and lay the foundation for modern search intensive applications. 
This session will draw your path into this relatively new technology, provide guidelines on its usage and practical advice on integration with your existing SQL Server solutions.
