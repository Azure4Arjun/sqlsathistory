## Title: Sharing and collaborating with your company through Tableau Server
## Abstract:
### Learn how to leverage Tableau Server to access interactive insights from anywhere. This session will help to familiarize you with the main features of Tableau Server, enabling you to publish, share and administrate content.

As a Tableau Desktop user, you will be able to create workbooks and views, dashboards, and data sources in Tableau Desktop, and then publish this content to your Server.

As a Tableau Server user, you will be able to access up-to-date content and gain quick insights without relying on static distributed content.

As a Tableau Server administrator you will control who has access to server content to help protect sensitive data. Administrators can set user permissions on projects, workbooks, views, and data sources.
