## Title: Migrating to PDW? Lessons from the Field 
## Abstract:
### Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) isn't SQL Server - it's different. It's bigger than that. It's a massively parallel-processing, distributed-database platform that leverages SQL Server as part of its architecture. But it has so much more to offer...

 In this 1-hour session, you will learn how to "embrace the change" and accelerate your migration to the data warehouse storage engine for the Microsoft Data Platform. This session will be packed with advice and recommendations from actual customer deployments and real-world experiences. Get on board the PDW train, and transform your data warehouse with the Microsoft Big Data Analytics Appliance!
