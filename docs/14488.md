## Title: Moving Day - Successful SQL Migrations
## Abstract:
### Moving day is one of life's most stressful times.  Details drown you, critical items consume time and attention, and there is always someone demanding you get something done now.  This is true whether you are moving your home or your data platform.  SQL Server migrations are a core competency for a DBA.  This presentation will give you a strong structured process for a successful migration using examples focused on SharePoint workloads.
