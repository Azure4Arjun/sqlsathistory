## Title: Choosing the Right Data Science Services in Azure: Scale, Automate, and Deploy with Ease
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Azure offers a multitude of cloud-based products that simplify the data science workflow in unique ways. Together these products each have different purposes that help the data science team with various aspects of the machine learning process.

In this session, we'll unpack the challenge in determining which product is best suited for each task. We'll explore the most popular machine learning products on Azure and describe how each fit into a typical data science workflow.

We'll also explore how to right-size your data science team to best utilize each Azure machine learning product so you’re efficiently solving problems as quickly and cheaply as possible.

By the end of this session, you'll understand how to choose the set of Azure machine learning products that fit your data science team within a typical data science workflow, allowing them to scale, automate, and deploy a machine learning process with ease.
