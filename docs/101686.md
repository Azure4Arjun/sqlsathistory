## Title: The Future Of The DBA In A Cloud Centric Environment
## Abstract:
### The cloud is a reality that is hitting everyone. What does this mean to you as a database administrator? Will the skills you've built transfer or will you become unnecessary? 

These questions trouble many, and honestly, they should. If you are passionate about your profession you will want to prepare for change to ensure that your skills grow with the environments and technologies you support. 

This presentation will cover the transition that we have made at SP Global and the changes that our team has had to make as we've moved to cloud centric environments and technologies. 

This goal of this session is to encourage attendees to become life long learners and to develop a renewed passions to grow with the changes in technology so that they will stay impactful. Attendees will also leave with key areas that they can focus on that will propel them to be cloud ready as quickly as possible.
