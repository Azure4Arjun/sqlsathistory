## Title: XpressInsight Framework as a Service - Rapid Implementation Data Warehousing Solution
## Abstract:
### XpressInsight is a Framework as a Service product that provides the modules and tools to rapidly implement an Enterprise Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence solution, at a fraction of the cost.  It is built entirely on the Microsoft BI stack using SQL Server 2016, SQL Server Analysis Services (tabular), SQL Server Reporting Services, and Microsoft Power BI.  In this session, we will demonstrate loading a data warehouse from multiple sources (A SQL server on Windows and an ORACLE DB on Linux) into a Kimball style dimensional model.  We will demonstrate how to measure and report on data quality, correct data quality issues, load auditing, self-service reporting with SSRS and Power BI, and publishing your Power BI reports and dashboards to the cloud while allowing those applications to retrieve the data from a secure on-premise location.
