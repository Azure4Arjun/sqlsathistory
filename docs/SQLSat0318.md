## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with Powe
## Abstract:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

## Speaker: Bradley Ball
## Title: Indexing Internals for Developers
## Abstract:
### What are the secrets to making your queries run faster?  Why does SQL Server use an index for some queries and not for others?  What makes a good index?  How many indexes should I have?  Have you ever asked these questions? When you want to understand an application you look at its core architecture. Underneath the covers SQL Server is just a C++ application.  Together we will discuss how the application architecture of SQL Server works, and how to apply this logic to building the best indexes for your queries.

# Get Your Nights  Weekends Back from SQL Server Planned Downtime
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-318)
Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2 Track
## Speaker: Carl Berglund
## Title: Get Your Nights  Weekends Back from SQL Server Planned Downtime
## Abstract:
### Major disaster events resulting in unplanned downtime get all the press—but planned downtime constitutes almost 80% of the outages in any IT environment. This downtime is typically for tech refresh, migration projects, and OS/SQL Server patching. And when do you have to schedule the large downtime windows required to accomplish these upkeep tasks? Nights and weekends. Like you don't have better things to do then! In this session, learn how you can get in-place upgrades for OS and/or SQL Server as fast as SQL Server can stop  restart, no data migrations for tech refresh, low-impact break/fix, and planned downtime windows of less than 2 minutes.

# Tired of the CRUD?  Automate it!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-318)
Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI/Big Data/Misc
## Speaker: Jack Corbett
## Title: Tired of the CRUD?  Automate it!
## Abstract:
### T4 templating support was added in the March 2014 release of SSDT.  This means we can now create a T4 template to automatically create CRUD procedures for all the tables in our database project.  Sure ORM tools like EF and nHibernate can handle CRUD operations in code, but if you want to provide an API to your database and avoid the tedious work of hand creating simple CRUD procedures this is the session for you!

After this session you will:

1. Understand the basics of T4 templating
2. Have a basic understanding of the Dac object model
3. Be able to create a script that will create 100's or even 1000's of CRUD procedures in seconds.

Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2 Track
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Easy SQL Server Benchmarking
## Abstract:
### Do you have a new piece of hardware going into service and want to see how well it performs? Or do you have a few systems and want to see how they compare against each other? Multiple free and easy ways to stress test your SQL Servers exist by simulating an OLTP workload against a real SQL Server and the infrastructure underneath. In this session we will demonstrate how to test your storage and SQL Server instances to get raw performance numbers that you can use to compare performance of machines across your enterprise. The utilities DVDStore, HammerDB, and SQLIO will be demonstrated in depth.

Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2 Track
## Speaker: Diana Betancourt
## Title: A DiBA guide to Database Standards
## Abstract:
### If you work with SQL Server, either as a developer, Dev/DBA, or accidental DBA, we are all DiBA's! but in order to keep that status and not run into "fire drill" mode, you need to make sure you set the ground to keep on looking good. This session will focus on how to set your Database Server environment in a way that will switch you from reactive to proactive mode. And I will demo its implementation via Policy Based Management.

# How To Kill SQL Server in 60 Minutes
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-318)
Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Admin 2 Track
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: How To Kill SQL Server in 60 Minutes
## Abstract:
### It is easy to design a system that uses SQL Server as a database backend. However, designing a system that efficiently works under heavy load is a much more complicated task. You can encounter the same set of database design and code mistakes in almost every system implemented by a team of application developers.

This Power Point-free session is targeted to developer DBAs and developers. It shows the commonly encountered obvious and not-so-obvious database design and T-SQL code mistakes and demonstrates how to bring a perfectly healthy SQL Server to its knees in just 60 minutes.

# How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-318)
Event Date: 27-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: T-SQL/SQL 2014 Track
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design
## Abstract:
### With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.

## Speaker: Ed Watson
## Title: Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part I
## Abstract:
### In this first part of a two part series, we look at performance tuning from the very beginning.  You're a new DBA, you want to be a DBA, or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings. Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  The application is running slowly. Can you help them? Do you even know where to begin to help them?  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow."

## Speaker: Eric Wisdahl
## Title: SQL 2014 In Memory OLTP and Natively Compiled Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2014 one of the most talked about new features is the In Memory OLTP (project "Hekaton") and natively compiled stored procedures which promise to deliver dramatic performance increases.  But, is this new feature ready for prime time or another version one that should be avoided until the next release?  In this session we will look at how you implement memory optimized tables and compiled procedures, do some quick demos and comparisons to see what the hype is about, and examine some of the considerations and requirements.

## Abstract:
### Are your backups like a stack of cash free for the taking, or a hardened ATM?  Are your database connections scrambled and safe or are you sending data over the party line?  In this session we will walk through the many ways SQL Server allows us to protect our data using encryption. We will evaluate the various methods for protecting data at rest, in the database, and while in transport.  Since nothing comes for free, we will look at how much all of this is going to cost us, in time, money, and failure to implement.

## Title: DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS
## Abstract:
### Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Lunch Break
## Abstract:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're out at lunch. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

## Title: Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan
## Abstract:
### What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!
