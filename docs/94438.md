## Title: Bespoke Visual Layouts with Charticulator
## Abstract:
### Got an idea for a data visualisation but don't want to write any code? There's a thing for that...

Charticulator comes from Microsoft Research and is used to create reusable, web-based bespoke data visualisations for use on the web. The icing on the cake is that you can use these templates to generate Power BI custom visuals as well!

In this session, we'll go through the concepts of the tool and build on these to create our own chart.
