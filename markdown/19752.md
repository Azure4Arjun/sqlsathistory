## Title: Designing and Loading Slowly Changing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Slowly Changing Dimensions form an integral part of any Data Warehouse environment, and there are many different factors that will determine the flexibility, scalability and effectiveness of the dimensional structure.

The first part of this session takes a look at all the different design elements and considerations of SCD's. We'll look at whether it is feasible to create a snowflake, how to deal with relationships between dimensions as well as 1:1 and many:many relationships with fact tables. 

Afterwards, we will walk-through a practical and effective method (with code) to load SCD's with T-SQL.
