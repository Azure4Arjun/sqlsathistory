## Title: Professional Recycling - SSIS Custom Control Flow Components with Visual Studio Community
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are an extensible data-integration platform. If the functionality of stock items do not suffice, the script component is the first point of extensibility. If these custom scripts are used in multiple SSIS packages/projects their handling gets quite cumbersome. For a professional recycling of (script) logic SSIS custom control-flow tasks are an option. With the announcement of Visual Studio Community edition there is no need of a full (and expensive) development environment. This session will cover the required tools, development tips  tricks and best practices for Custom ControlFlow development.
