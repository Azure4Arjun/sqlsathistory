Event Date: 11-02-2017 - Session time: 10:10:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Susantha Bathige
## Title: Statistics and New Cardinality Estimator Model
## Abstract:
### Statistics in SQL Server plays a major role creating execution plan which essentially decides server performance. If you get a good execution plan the server performance is good otherwise it will impact negatively on the server performance. SQL Server 2014 introduced new Cardinality Estimation (CE) model to improve the quality of the execution plans via quality estimates of row counts. The new CE model is a major redesign to the Query Optimizer since SQL Server 7.0. In this session, I'm going to talk about how statistics is used to generate the execution plan, how execution plan changes with new CE model with demos.

# How you can use disconnected tables in PowerPivot/Tabular models to solve real world problems
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-582)
Event Date: 11-02-2017 - Session time: 11:25:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Matt Allington
## Title: How you can use disconnected tables in PowerPivot/Tabular models to solve real world problems
## Abstract:
### When people first start out with Power Pivot/Tabular data models, the first thing they learn is how to create "one to many" relationships between tables.  But did you know it is quite valid to load tables into your data model that are "disconnected"?

In this session I introduce 4 real world scenarios that demonstrate how you can use the power of DAX disconnected tables to solve business problems.  The scenarios are:
* Allow users to perform what if analysis and change the calculation values in a pivot table by altering the input values for key variables using a slicer.
* Allow users to change the series that is displayed on a chart using input from a slicer.
* Grouping you customers into age groups so you can create cohorts for reporting and analysis using "banding"
* Displaying the "latest survey result" in a Pivot Table for any date selected.  It is very easy to see the "results" for a period using Power Pivot/Tabular. But it is much harder to find the "latest " from any period.

Event Date: 11-02-2017 - Session time: 11:25:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Victor Isakov
## Title: Query Store: A (R)evolution in Query Tuning
## Abstract:
### Fixing performance problems and detecting query regressions has never been easy in SQL Server as the database engine fundamentally does not capture the relevant information. With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has introduced a feature called Query Store that will help you capture vital query metrics that will help performance troubleshooting and regression detection. In this session we will examine Query Store and how it can be used in a myriad of use cases. We will examine its architecture, configuration and shortcomings. This session will help you build a monitoring solution that will help you detect and solve real-world performance problems across your entire SQL Server infrastructure. It will also substantially help de-risk upgrade projects, so there's no "excuse" not to upgrade to SQL Server 2016!

Event Date: 11-02-2017 - Session time: 14:05:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: Oh, When did THAT change happen?
## Abstract:
### “Oh, when did that change happen?” is a reasonably common question that SQL consultants hear. 
Closely followed by “who made that change?” and possibly “how do we revert the change?”.
There’s a few mechanisms available in SQL Server to do this – but we have to have these active in order to capture information about the change.
In this session, we’ll look at some of the options that we have available to us for auditing data (and meta data) changes. These include SQL Audit and the new Temporal tables and Query Store features among other.
You should leave this session with a firm knowledge of which feature is right for your auditing scenario.

## Title: Why your charts suck and how to fix them
## Abstract:
### Building effective data visualizations is an increasingly important skill. As data professionals the amount of data and the speed at which it is arriving is constantly growing. At the same time our business users are increasingly time poor in a world filled with distractions and shiny things. With social media, instant messaging, conference calls and emails if the message that you are trying to convey is not clear, engaging and easy to understand it will not get the attention that it deserves.

Clicking next, next, next, finish on a chart wizard is not the way to build engaging data visualizations.

In this presentation we will look at what you need to consider to build clear and engaging data visualizations and what pitfalls you should avoid.

## Title: R; One Ring to Rule Them All
## Abstract:
### R is one of the most popular and powerful analytics languages. That helps data scientists to prepare data, predict data, and visualize it. Microsoft offers several deployment options to bring next-generation advanced analytics to your business. Microsoft R Server delivers R-based analytics to where your data lives. Processing analytics in-place eliminates data movement, reducing latencies and operational costs. 
In this session, first basic concepts of machine learning will be discussed. Then, a demo of how to use R for data wrangling, and visualization (show map) in R studio will present. Then I will show how R can be helpful for software developers to create a intelligence software using R in visual studio and  Azure ML API in c# codes. Finally a couple of demos will be presented on how R can help BI developers and database administrators using  R server ,R in SQL Server 2016, and power BI to create smart reports.

Event Date: 11-02-2017 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Guy Glantser
## Title: How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance
## Abstract:
### Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren't aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will also learn many techniques for solving these problems and boosting your application performance.
