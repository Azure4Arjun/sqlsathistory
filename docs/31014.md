## Title: SQL University 101:Starting the SQL Journey
## Abstract:
### On my blog I've started a project called SQL University aimed at folks looking to learn SQL Server from the ground up. This session will start at ground level tasks and resources all database professionals should know. This session is aimed at entry-level folks but anyone is welcome to attend to sharpen up their basic skills and resources!
