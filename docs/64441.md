## Title: How to Manage Many Instances of SQL
## Abstract:
### When managing a single instance it can be fairly easy to keep track of the configuration of that instance, but what about when you have more than 10 instances to manage? How do know they are setup correctly?  How do you maintain the databases on each instance and their configurations? How do take care of patching? In this talk we will answer these questions and more as we discuss best practices and technologies (such as PowerShell and CMS) to help keep your instance configurations in-sync.
