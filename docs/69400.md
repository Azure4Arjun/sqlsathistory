## Title: Help! I Need Somebody. Help!: Resources for the New or Accidental DBA
## Abstract:
### Knowing how to help yourself when using SQL Server is a skill. What do I do when I get stuck? How do I learn more about a particular feature of SQL Server? Where do I go? Who do I ask? What options are out there for learning and assistance? In this session, I'll answer those questions. You will leave this session with a bountiful list of resources, links, and ideas to "Help you get your feet back on the ground".
