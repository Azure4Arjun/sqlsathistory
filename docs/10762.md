## Title: The Art of Questions and success as an IT Pro
## Abstract:
### Data professionals spend a lot of time asking questions. You spend countless hours refining your techcial skills but how much time do you spend learning researching and practicing the art of asking questions? 

What might happen to your career if you did? 

This session presents a bit of theory on the art and science of questions. Here's a question for you: Did you know that asking "why" questions can make people feel defensive and can color the way they respond to you? Strange but true. We'll review some of the biggest mistakes you can make when asking questions and Iâ€™ll offer a few some tips on how you can turn mediocre questions into great questions. 

And oh yeah. I'll leave time for asking questions at the end.
