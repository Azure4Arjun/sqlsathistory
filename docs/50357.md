## Title: SQL Server Quiz Show
## Abstract:
### You are invited to be a participant on the SQL Server Quiz Show; this interactive session will test your knowledge on many different areas of SQL Server.  We will be using an online tool to allow you to submit your answers to questions via mobile device or laptop, but don#39;t worry, total scores are only shown to yourself, so you don#39;t have to worry about competing against others.

This session promises to be fast paced and fun and hopefully you will even learn something.  This session will also be of value to people who need to interview or be interviewed for SQL Server positions as the questions may be the type of things you might hear in an interview.
