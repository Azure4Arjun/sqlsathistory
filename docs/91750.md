## Title: Transaction Log Internals and Performance
## Abstract:
### The transaction log is one of the most critical, yet often misunderstood, components of SQL Server. From out of control log growth to very long start-up times, problems with the transaction log can cause a lot of pain. In this session, we'll look at how the transaction log works and what information is actually stored in the log. You'll learn how to optimize the log's performance, determining the right settings for log growth, and what to do when things get out of control.
