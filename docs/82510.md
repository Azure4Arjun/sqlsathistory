## Speaker: William Assaf
## Title: Think Like a Certification Exam
## Abstract:
### Do you want insight into how certification exams are written, how questions are designed, and how to follow a logical process of elimination? We'll go through the process of item creation, what rules writers must follow, and review some sample questions together.  We'll leave time for QA with a veteran of the Microsoft certification exam writing process.
