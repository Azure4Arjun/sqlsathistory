## Title: Cloud Database Scalability with SQL Federation
## Abstract:
### You have migrated your SQL Server database to Windows Azure SQL Database (AKA SQL Azure), and you have migrated your application to Windows Azure. Now what? As the load on your database begins to increase, the need to scale your new SQL Database instance becomes a realization. In this demo-filled session we'll explore SQL Federation, Microsoft's solution for cloud database scalability. This session will look at the scalability model for the cloud and how SQL Federation solves the scale-out issue. We'll look at the architecture of SQL Federation and you can apply SQL Federation to your cloud database solution.
