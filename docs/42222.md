## Title: Know your bottlenecks: Wait time analysis
## Abstract:
### Find the bottlenecks in your environment using best practice wait based analysis.  If you listen to your database engine, it will tell you where it's spending the time which helps the database professional identify where to focus for performance issues.  We tend to jump straight to resources when we hear performance issues - what if I told you there's a better way?
