## Speaker: Audrey Hammonds
## Title: T-SQL Awesomeness: 3 Ways to Write Cool SQL
## Abstract:
### There’s nothing quite as satisfying as writing a cool bit of T-SQL. Luckily for us, there are some truly awesome ways to make your data do just what you need it to do, while improving performance and/or readability. 

Come learn three new-school ways to expand your T-SQL repertoire with: • Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE) • EXCEPT and INTERSECT • CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY 

We will look at data models and scenarios you might encounter that lend themselves to these techniques, see old-school ways to solve T-SQL challenges, and then compare them to newer, leaner ways to get the same result set. Impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad T-SQL skills.

# Performance Tuning With Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)
Event Date: 04-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Performance
## Speaker: Eric Wisdahl
## Title: Performance Tuning With Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at examining execution plans as a method for performance tuning. With the execution plan we can see the exact type of operation performed, and, more than that, we can look at the differences in what the optimizer thought the query would cost vs what it actually cost to perform the query. By examining the plans we have a road map for determining what type of improvements we should be striving for in order to make the particular statement more optimal.

## Abstract:
### Originally released with Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework v4, Entity Framework v4 has seen a remarkable evolution in the past year or so. In April, Microsoft released version 4.1. Most notably, there is now great support for Code First development. This talk will delve into the use of Code First in Entity Framework v4.1 and will be very code focused. Developers will learn how they can use the Entity Framework APIs to create applications that use Entity Framework features to access relational databases without the need to use designers to create the model. It is in essence a "code only" approach, which has many benefits, including for testability and long-term evolution of your code.

We will go over some basic OOP information but the bulk of this session will be hands on building/demoing. No .NET experience is required. The less experience you have with .NET development the better!!

### You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

# Transition from DBA to BI Architect 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)
Event Date: 04-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS and BI
## Speaker: Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Transition from DBA to BI Architect 
## Abstract:
### Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.

# Predictive Analytics - You Can, Too!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)
Event Date: 04-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA and TSQL
## Speaker: Troy Ketsdever
## Title: Predictive Analytics - You Can, Too!
## Abstract:
### Predictive analytics is no longer exclusively for those shops that have the resources to design and implement an entire BI architecture. In this session, we will review a class of modeling problems that are not only quite powerful, but are amenable to implementation via relatively simple T-SQL querying. All it takes to get started is the data available in your OLTP system, a basic understanding of the math, and a bit of imagination…

# Table Vars and Temp Tables: What you NEED to know!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)
Event Date: 04-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA and TSQL
## Speaker: Wayne Sheffield
## Title: Table Vars and Temp Tables: What you NEED to know!
## Abstract:
### Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, 'When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"

# Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)
Event Date: 04-06-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SSIS and BI
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
## Abstract:
### Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson discusses the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

# Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#77---Pensacola-2011)

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

## Speaker: William Assaf
## Title: SQL Server DMV Overview
## Abstract:
### What are DMV's in SQL 2005/2008, and how can you use them to improve query performance, discover indexing needs and more? Dynamic Management Views are essential tools for the SQL 2005/2008 administrator but have a wide range of applications by developers, network engineers and DBAs. Now updated with more jokes and more practical scripts!
