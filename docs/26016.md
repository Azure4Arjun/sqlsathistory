## Title:  Proactive Administration with Ring Buffers.
## Abstract:
### Ring buffers were added in SQL Server 2005. They provide diagnostic data that can be used to troubleshoot server issues such as memory and CPU pressure. By storing this wealth of information in SQL Server, we can spot problems/trends and even resolve problems automatically without having to page the on-call DBA to fix it. In this session, we'll take a look at what ring buffers provides and also what we can do with the data. I'll show you a scenario that recently occurred in my environment and what I did to correct the problem before customers were even aware of it. The tool that I wrote can easily be placed in your environment and adapted to your needs.
