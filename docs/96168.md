## Title: Using Clustered Column Store Indexes at Scale
## Abstract:
### Using a real world example that is in production this session will go though pitfalls I experienced and how to avoid these mistakes in the beginning  which will save you lots of data wrangling over time.
 
Clustered Column Store Indexes are a great tool when used correctly. This session will explain on how to plan, configure, and operate Clustered Colum Store indexes to handle trillions of rows.
