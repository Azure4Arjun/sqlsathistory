## Title: I have Indexes, but do I have the Right Indexes?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server indexes come in multiple types: clustered, non-clustered, full text and column store. In this session, you’ll get an understanding of what these types are and when each is an appropriate solution. We will explain and demonstrate each type, and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.
