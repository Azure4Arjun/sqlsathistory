## Title: 16 Enhancements for SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Microsoft announced SQL Server 2016 on April 1, 2015 and it is no joke! In this session we'll examine 16 of the new enhancements that are coming in the latest version of SQL Server that is currently available in a technology preview.  there are so many enhancements that I can't cover them all in one session! So we will examine some in high level reviews and more in-depth previews such as row level security, query store, and always encrypted.
