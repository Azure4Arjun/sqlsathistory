## Speaker: Paul LaGrone
## Title: Do I need to know about BIML? Of course you do!
## Abstract:
### This topic will be about creating dynamic SSIS packages using BIML. Dynamic SSIS packages will help eliminate the hassle of having to manually change items in a Data Flow task when an underlying table change occurs. This talk will start from the ground up, showing a basic SSIS package, what it would take to create it dynamically in C#, and then the same package using BIML. While we will show some examples of BIML and C#, no experience in either of these is required, as the talk will be more concepts to get ideals flowing.

If you have data to move, BIML could be your new friend!
