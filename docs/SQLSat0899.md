# User Experience Brilliance in Power BI Dashboards
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#899---Birmingham-2019)
Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Hilary Wilkie
## Title: User Experience Brilliance in Power BI Dashboards
## Abstract:
### User Experience (UX) and Design Thinking are common buzz words around the office. What do these words have to do with BI and Dashboards, anyway? 
Sure, Power BI itself is intuitive and user friendly, but are YOU building dashboards that give the best user experience? 
In this session we will explore in a hands-on exercise what UX and Design thinking is, how to apply the methodologies to our daily work and then how we could apply it to BI to make kick ass dashboards and reporting for our internal and external customers.

## Speaker: Kevin Wilkie
## Title: Azure Data Factory V2
## Abstract:
### Moving data around in On-Prem databases is easy. 

Moving data around when involving Azure - may be not. Especially if you don't have a VM or an On-Prem server to move things around on. 

We'll look at moving data around from On-Prem to Azure, moving files to Azure, and moving data between Azure databases.

# That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#899---Birmingham-2019)
Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.

# Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#899---Birmingham-2019)
Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

# PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#899---Birmingham-2019)
Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Mike Robbins
## Title: PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server professional, are you able to make a rhyme or reason to this thing called PowerShell? Need to accomplish something? Do you use Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core? How will you interface with PowerShell? With the PowerShell console, ISE, VSCode, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, or something else? Will you use Cmdlets from one of the various SQL related PowerShell modules? If so, which one? SQLPS, SQLServer, DBATools, etc. Or maybe you should use the SQL PS provider? What about SMO? Or write your own custom .NET code that can be executed with PowerShell? With it being so difficult to determine how to go about running something in PowerShell, it’s no wonder that most people resort to searching the Internet to figure it out. The sad thing is that most of the PowerShell code you’ll find on the Internet is less than optimal to say the least. I'll demonstrate how and when to use different approaches along with adhering to the community’s best practices for writing PowerShell code.

# PowerShell Core for Linux
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#899---Birmingham-2019)
Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Robert Cain
## Title: PowerShell Core for Linux
## Abstract:
### With the advent of SQL Server for Linux, you need a tool you can use to manage it. Sure, you could try to learn bash, python, or some other tool, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to use a scripting language you're familiar with? Or maybe you are a long time Linux admin, now having to work with all this new Microsoft technology. Wouldn't it be great to leverage tools that make your life even easier?

In this session you'll learn all about PowerShell Core for Linux. You'll see just how quick and easy it is to install PowerShell Core, then interact with it from the terminal. But wait, there's more! You'll want a good editor to compose your PowerShell Core scripts in, and that's where VSCode comes in. You'll see how easy it is to install VSCode, then work with your PowerShell Core project within it. 

We'll wrap up the session showing how to install SQL Server in a Docker Container, all using PowerShell Core!

Event Date: 27-07-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
## Abstract:
### So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.
