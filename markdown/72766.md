## Speaker: Mark Hudson
## Title: HDInsight > Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Some people think of Azure HDInsight as Microsoft’s Hadoop in The Cloud. That thought is only partially correct. With storage separate from compute, HDInsight flexibility offers Hadoop with Pig and Hive options as well as HBase, Storm, Spark, R Server, and Kafka … all priced a la carte and on-demand. Join me as I explain what HDInsight is and is not along with some live demos of HDInsight’s capabilities.
