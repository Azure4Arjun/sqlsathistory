Event Date: 14-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Steve Hood
## Title: Monitoring and Baselines
## Abstract:
### During an incident you can look at every stat in SQL Server, but if you don’t know what normal is for that specific server then they won’t be very useful to you.  Also, outside of incidents, it’s very beneficial to know what your most expensive queries are for the month instead of since the last recompile, or seeing when your page life expectancy drops instead of just noticing it’s low.  Without proactively monitoring SQL Server you’re making your job more difficult and less productive at the same time.

This will cover OS Perf Counters, Wait Stats, Traces, Blocking, Query Stats, Index Stats, Database Sizes and Table Sizes, all presented in a format of what you should be watching and how it will help you.
