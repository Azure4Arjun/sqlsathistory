## Title: Troubleshooting Blocking for Beginners
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Server is slow, and you suspect blocking. You need to set up simple, lightweight monitoring using free tools to document who’s holding locks, who’s stuck waiting, and which queries are causing deadlocks. In this session we will work through three real-world scenarios where blocking problems steal your performance, and sometimes kill your queries. You will learn how to cut through the confusion with free tools and scripts that reveal which queries are slowing down your SQL Server.
