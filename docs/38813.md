## Title: There May Be No Free Lunch But You Can Have Free Training
## Abstract:
### Did you know that you don't have to wait until the next PASS Summit or BA Conference to get more training? If your company can't send everyone to the big conferences every year, it definitely doesn't mean you have to go without keeping up your skills or increasing your knowledge. You've found your way to SQL Saturday, and that's a great first step. But there is so much more out there. I'll share with you free resources including blogs, user groups, PASS virtual chapters, Twitter, Linked In, online forums, and other websites. These resources will help you stay connected to the SQL/BI community year-round so you can continue to increase your skills without draining your company's training budget or your wallet.
