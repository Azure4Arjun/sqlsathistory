## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: SQL Server Storage: Filegroups, Files, Partitions
## Abstract:
### It’s hard to find good information about SQL Server storage. Should you put data and log files on different drives when they’re on a SAN? How do you know when to add more data files? Is there an advantage to using multiple filegroups? Brent’s a former SAN administrator and wrote the storage chapter of Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting. He’s got the answers you’re looking for, and he’ll help demystify what SQL Server’s doing inside the black box. Attendees will learn why you shouldn’t add files to an existing filegroup, how to get faster performance from TempDB, and how to check your file performance using DMVs.
