## Title: You inherited a database Now What?
## Abstract:
### You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks.  When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything.  At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited.
