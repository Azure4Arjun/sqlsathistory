## Title: Understanding SQL Server Backup and Restore
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that it's critical to have backups but it's amazing how few people make sure those backups can be restored properly! Too many times to count,  lt;name removedgt; has been brought in by organizations to help recover failed systems where administrators simply didn't know how to properly restore SQL Server backups when they have to. In this session, lt;name removedgt; will explain the various types of backups that can be taken and demonstrate how to restore each of them. Apart from covering the common full, differential and log backups,  lt;name removedgt; will also cover partial, filegroup, and COPY_ONLY backups, backing up to and restoring from a URL, backup encryption, and how to perform a hack attach for the ultimate tail log restore. There's something here for everyone to learn!
