## Title: Common Data Service, why is it not common yet?
## Abstract:
### Within the Power Platform, there's a data store called Common Data Service (CDS). But why would you use it? You've several hundred connectors allowing you to connect to almost every type of data storage. Well, CDS is an easy way to define and centralize business logic over multiple, interconnected applications handling various types of data.

In this session, we have a good look at CDS and find his strengths and weaknesses. We'll see how to build, ingest and extract data from CDS using demos. When you're using the Power Platform and/or curious about CDS but haven't used it yet, join me at this session.
