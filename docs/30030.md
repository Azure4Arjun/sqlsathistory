## Speaker: David Taylor
## Title: Using SSRS with Trending Reports
## Abstract:
### Utilizing only T-SQL and algebra, I will engage the attendees in a discussion of teasing trends out of data buried within SQL Server, without having to learn the intricacies of Data Warehousing and MDX Querying. It is my hope that my methods can be used and expanded upon in your field, and I invite those who use SQL Server in any environment to come join the discussion.
