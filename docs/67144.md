## Title: DevOps and the Agile DBA
## Abstract:
### This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”. We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
Develop, Rinse, Repeat
Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.
How the shorter development cycle build business success.
How the DBA can do more with less.
Discover the power of virtualization and powerful agile development practices providing more value to even the most senior database expert. We’ll demo different scenarios surrounding DevOps, virtualization and how to make the DBA pivotal to DevOps success.
