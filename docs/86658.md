## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance for DBAs
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is a deployment model of Azure SQL Database, providing near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server on-premises. Managed Instance allows existing SQL Server customers to lift and shift their on-premises applications to the cloud with minimal application and database changes. At the same time, Managed Instance preserves all PaaS capabilities (automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high-availability ), that drastically reduces management overhead and TCO. 
In this session, learn:
1. Lift and Shift - Features compatability
2. Fully managed PaaS - what does the DBA need to manage
3. Full isolation and security - VNet support and security
4. Sizing and limitations
5. Best practices from customer deployments
6. Roadmap
