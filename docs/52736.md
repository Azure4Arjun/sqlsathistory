## Title: Polybase in SQL Server 2016: Let's query Big Data with T-SQL !
## Abstract:
### Polybase is one of the new features that got released on the new SQL Server 2016 version. It's a pretty useful technology if you want to access and join both relational and non-relational data,  all from within SQL Server. We can run this queries against external data like Hadoop or Azure blob storage with the advantage of the query computation be optimized and managed on our Hadoop cluster.
Attend my session if you want to learn how to take advantage of this technology and where we can use it in real life scenarios. I will also cover installation, configuration and troubleshooting.
