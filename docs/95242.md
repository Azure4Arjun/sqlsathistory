## Title: Practical Real-World Performance Tuning for Accidental DBAs
## Abstract:
### In most of the organizations, accidental DBAs are the individuals who are often responsible for the SQL Server Performance. In the real world when we face any performance problems, we do not have the luxury to open PowerPoint and study theory. What helps us during the time of crisis are handy scripts which help us fix our performance problems.
In this quick paced, demonstration-oriented learning session, we will see how we can immediately help our application with performance if we just know what exactly to do.
We will cover the following topics during our session 
a) Learn and Implement best deployment and configurations practices
b) Indexing (and statistics) best practices deployments
c) Understanding cardinality and compatibility levels and their impact
d) Enabling SQL Server 2019 (on-premises and cloud) new features
