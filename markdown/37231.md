## Title: The first step towards continuous integration for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice that has become widely adopted for the application layer because it allows teams to detect problems quickly and locate errors more easily. By regularly integrating code into a shared repository and automatically verifying it you'll build confidence in your code.

But database CI continues to be a painful, manual process in many projects. There are many reasons for this, most obviously the issue of data persistence, but there are ways to handle these issues.

In this session, I will show you:

-How easy it is to get your SQL Server database changes in source control
-How to set up an automated build process for your databases
-How this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker
-How to produce an artifact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future
