## Title: SQL Server 2016 Query Store – a flight recorder of your database
## Abstract:
### If you are a DBA you know that troubleshooting query performance can become a nightmare, all you have is your current plan cache as a source, and some DMVs to query it. 
With the Query Store feature, SQL Server 2016 saves historical execution plans. Not only that but it also saves the query statistics that go along with those historical plans. This is a great new feature which allows you to track execution plans performance for your queries over time. Similar to an airplane’s flight data recorder, Query Store collects and presents detailed historic information about all queries, greatly simplifying performance tuning by reducing the time to diagnose and resolve issues.
