## Title: What Developers Need to Know About Hekaton
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s new In-Memory table technology (codenamed “Hekaton”) promises to be one of the most exciting new features to be released when SQL Server 2014 ships. As a DB Developer it completes changes they way you can build high-performance OLTP applications: all the data is in memory and there is no locking! In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will discuss Hekaton from a Developer perspective. Victor will cover Hekaton’s architecture and internals, Transact-SQL surface area, interop considerations and what performance gains to expect. He will also present some use cases and examples of where Hekaton can be used.
