## Title: This is how developers might punish your database
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has traditionally been the go-to database for software development teams looking for a way of persisting their data, but the recent NoSQL movement has rendered visible just how limiting the relational model can be - and that may have led people to use other kinds of databases, like key-value stores, document databases, etc.

SQL Server does have some ways of misusing it, though, that you might have  missed! In this session we’ll take a look at three alternative ways of using SQL Server, since we’ll see exactly how your favorite RDBMS can be turned into a document database, a reliable message queue, and an event store in a CQRS architecture.

Participants will get an introduction to all the mentioned concepts, and there will be code examples in C#.
