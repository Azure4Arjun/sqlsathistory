## Abstract:
### This session is for the beginner to SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).    In this session, we will step you through creating an Extraction, Transformation, and Load (ETL) package in SSIS from scratch to move and process your data.   We will start with an overview of SSIS in general, and then highlight the different connections, tasks, and transformations available in the workflow and data flow engines as we build our new SSIS package.   When you leave you will be to create a basic SSIS package on your own.
