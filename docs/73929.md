## Title: Manipulating SharePoint Data in Power BI
## Abstract:
### As Office 365 becomes more widely adopted, the chances of having to integrate SharePoint data as a source in Power BI becomes more of a reality. While importing the data is easy, making it useful and meaningful in Power BI can be convoluted. In this session, we will use the Power BI Desktop Application to explore how to manipulate common SharePoint data types, such multi-value columns, the person field, and date hierarchies. Demos will use SharePoint Online but can also be applied to SharePoint on-premises environments.
