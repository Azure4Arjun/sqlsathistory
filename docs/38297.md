## Title: What is Biml and why are SSIS people talking about it?
## Abstract:
### This session is designed for you, the experienced SSIS developer who's been hearing about Biml but hasn't taken the plunge. We will cover what Biml is and walk through some examples from Hello World equivalent to a fully baked truncate and reload pattern. You will leave this session armed with the knowledge of how Biml can help you achieve a consistent and reproducible approach for the creation of SSIS solutions.
