### In this session we will cover the best strategies to track and improve SSRS / Power BI Report Server performance and scalability. We will cover methods of tracking report performance through DMVs, leveraging the Report Server ExecutionLog3 catalog view, and monitoring Power BI Report Server / Reporting Services using performance monitor (perfmon), and more.
