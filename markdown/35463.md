## Speaker: Terry Bomberger
## Title: Getting With it With With (and Over On It, Too)
## Abstract:
### While CTEs and Analytic functions were new features in SS2005, this talk will rather focus on the utility of these features focusing on uses gleaned from the speaker's experience.  We will cover performance enhancements, clarity of code, and problems to which the recursive capabilities of WITH can be applied as well as some ways to apply analytic functions to better performance.
