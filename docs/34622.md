## Title: Real World API Design Using The Entity Framework
## Abstract:
### In this session I will show you how I used the Entity Framework Services to design and create an API servicing layer to expose back end data to partners. We will dive into using the Entity Framework (data layer), WCF Data Services (service layer), T4 templates (business entities), WCF Message Inspectors (security) and more.
