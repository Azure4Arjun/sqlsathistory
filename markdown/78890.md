## Speaker: Ewald Cress
## Title: A Gentle Intro to Multi-master Replication
## Abstract:
### Whenever we have two independently updatable copies of a piece of data, we live with the spectre of merge conflicts. This problem has existed for ages, but with so much distributed architecture in the cloud era, more of us get exposed to the pain.

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) evolved as a way to accept updates at multiple replicas with automatic conflict resolution, and to remove such concerns from application development. Inevitably though, you have to apply a different mindset to data design.

In this talk, I'll cover the basic premise of what CRDTs are, a few example CRDTs, the kind of programming interface they expose, and a glimpse into their internal workings. While the literature in this area tends to be a bit academic, we'll be taking a commonsense approach, giving you a useful toehold into the subject for further exploration.
