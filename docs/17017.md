## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
## Abstract:
### Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can not be handled with a single simple or complex query.  TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.


I will be covering derived tables, local temporary tables, global temporary tables, table variables, user tables in tempdb, and common table expressions in my examples using the AdventureWorks database.  The pros and cons of each contruct will be examined.  Advanced options like enabling trace flag 1118 will be explored.
