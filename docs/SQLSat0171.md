# Building Your First Tabular Model
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#171-Pittsburgh-2012)
Event Date: 06-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room AB308
## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine (This is the same engine used by PowerPivot.) To use the new xVelocity engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to create calculations, measures, and KPI’s. DAX is similar to the expression language used in excel and it should be easier to use than MDX and appeal to a broader audience.
This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded).

## Title: Don’t Panic DBAs! Databases on VMware Made Easy
## Abstract:
### Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. We hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

## Speaker: Eric Kepes
## Title: MicroORMs – Keeping Your DBA Happy
## Abstract:
### Developers like the reduced complexity and increased productivity that an ORM can bring while DBAs don't care for the data models that often result. Using an ORM with an existing data model is often a nightmare. But writing all of that data mapping code is such a pain! What if we could have a solution that gave us the best of both worlds and made the developers AND the DBAs happy? MicroORMs might be the answer. In this session, we’ll explore PetaPOCO, a MicroORM.

## Title: Full-Text Search, it's not just for documents
## Abstract:
### Full-text search is an often overlooked feature of SQL Server that can be used for more than searching documents. This session will cover setting up and using full-text search to handle some of those dirty data situations we've all inherited without using the dreaded "LIKE '%text%'". As an example, we will demonstrate how full-text search can be used to find names in poorly formatted data like 'mailing address' or 'billing address' fields. It will also cover how to handle noise words that may match some names and synonyms for first names to create a really robust solution that goes beyond what could be done with plain old SQL.

## Speaker: Matt Velic
## Title: Communicate for Great Good!
## Abstract:
### “No one knows what I do.” That’s a chief complaint of data professionals everywhere, and it’s a dangerous position to be in as well. Reviews may not be favorable, promotions more uncommon, and training dollars more rare. But by practicing written and verbal communication, new opportunities may present themselves. Blogging can land a book deal. In-house team lunch-and-learns can lead to community presentations. Most of all, good communication can be the skill that saves your job or opens the door to new horizons.

At least that's what many of our non-DBA colleagues think. Not so fast, says veteran DBA Mike Hillwig. SQL Server has lots of default settings that can be potential performance killers, and we'll look at a bunch of them. These include things like where data files live, data file growth, basic security settings, and the services being installed. And while we're at it, we'll look at a bunch of the good defaults and talk about why they shouldn't be touched.
