## Title: Building your First SQL Server Container Lab in Docker
## Abstract:
### It wasn’t that long ago when virtualization changed the way we work with SQL and infrastructure. Now it’s all about containers. Containers can make the DBA’s job of creating and deploying servers much easier, freeing them up for other tasks such as performance tuning and security. In this session, we will go over the concepts of containers and their general capabilities. Then we will build, connect and configure a SQL Server in a container for use as a private lab.
