## Title: Getting More from your Data with Azure Data Catalog
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Catalog is a service that helps data producers and data consumers get more value from existing data sources by making them easier to discover and understand. Users can register data sources to add them to the catalog with tags and annotations to share their purpose and intended use, and can discover them through searching, browsing and filtering. 

If you want the data you produce to have more impact, or you want to spend less time looking for the right data to use, please join us for this interactive session. We will cover the capabilities of the Azure Data Catalog, common scenarios for its use, and information about how to get started putting Data Catalog to work for you.
