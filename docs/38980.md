## Title: Data Warehouse modeling, for data analysis and cubes
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services OLAP cubes provide an incredibly powerful platform for the analysis and reporting of complex data. Unfortunately we often find that our source data is not in the right structure to make the best use of the cube’s power. This limits the cube’s functionality, compromises performance and complicates the reports.
In this session we’ll look at a number of different data scenarios that we encounter and explore ways of remodelling the data within the data warehouse to optimize it for cubes and MDX. We’ll see how adding functionality into the ETL layer and data warehouse can have a dramatic effect on the functionality and simplicity of the cube.
