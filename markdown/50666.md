## Title: Write Queries Faster with AutoHotKey
## Abstract:
### AutoHotKey (AHK) is an open source Windows application used to create macros, hot keys, and "text expansions". Nathan has used this program for years in many different ways, but he finds it especially useful in SQL Server Management Studio. Come and see how  AHK can put a library of code snippets--and full queries--at your fingertips.
