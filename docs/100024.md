## Title: Working with JSON in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### JSON support was one of the most requested features on the Microsoft Connect site.  I will walk through a brief history of JSON in SQL Server with comparisons to XML, then break out some T-SQL demos.  The demos will illustrate the fundamentals of working with JSON and some "gotchyas."  The demos will also become more complex as the session progresses and attempt to illustrate realistic scenarios and creative uses for working with JSON.
