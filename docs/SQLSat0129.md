# But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#129---Rochester-2012)
Event Date: 12-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: D
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

# Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#129---Rochester-2012)
Event Date: 12-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: C
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
## Abstract:
### The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

# Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#129---Rochester-2012)
Event Date: 12-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: C
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.
