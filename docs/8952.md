## Title: Better Data Visualisation for CRM and ERP
## Abstract:
### Come and learn best practices for designing charts to help people understand their business data effortlessly.
Need to create charts and dashboards for people to get insight from their complex data and make better business decisions? This session will show you what to do, and more importantly why. Understand the way our brains are wired and take advantage of our ability to process some types of visual data far more easily than others. You will learn some great tips for better visualisation, and common pitfalls to avoid, rather than the technical ins-and-outs of how to achieve this with a specific piece of software. The main focus will be on charts and dashboards for CRM or ERP systems, but the approaches are just as valid using Excel, PowerPivot, SSRS or big analytics products from any data source.
