## Title: Workload Replay: Synthetic vs Real-World Benchmarking
## Abstract:
### How much do you really understand how your workload changes based on the time of day, background processing, user load, or which application module is in use? There's no better way to understand your workload than to benchmark and replay it. This will help you mitigate risk in production before making changes, allow you to find and improve bottlenecks in your code or infrastructure. In this session, you will learn the process of using both synthetic (when applicable) and real-world capture tools to test your environment to make you look like a rockstar.
