## Title: Fast Track that Cube Please
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been thrown into a position where upper management wants to analyze and report off their data and your in charge? Are you writing complex T-SQL scripts and know there is a better way to achieve your goal? Maybe a multi-dimensional cube is just the answer your looking for. But do you know how to build it? In this session we will look at a data warehouse and build a small cube from the ground up. We will define a basic star schema and how to use it within a SSAS solution. We will look at the frame work around the cube such as the fact table, dimensions, attribute relationships, dimension usage, measures, and partitions. You will also learn a few tricks along the way to optimize for performance.
