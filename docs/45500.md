## Title: Build Your BI House with a Blueprint: Modeling for MS BI
## Abstract:
### The topic for this session will be modeling for MS BI with a focus on multidimensional modeling. We’ll talk about a recommended blueprint for MS BI projects, the best option for effectively handing deleted rows, denormalization, degenerate dimensions, slowly changing dimensions, many-to-many relationships, considerations for predictive analytics, and tips for migrating from other platforms. Given time considerations, we’ll also be covering how agile methodologies and ABC (audit, balance and control) impact our modeling decisions. Come join us for an information packed hour!
