## Title: Improved data models; what you need to increase the usability and speed of Power BI reports
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a great tool for ad-hoc analysis, but without considering the final purpose of the report, this will lead to poorly designed data models that replicate the tables structured from the source data. 
To ensure great usability, performance, adaptability and scalability, you need to apply some basic data modelling practices to your Power BI models. In this session, we will discuss:
•	How to interpret business peoples requirements to conceptualise the model
•	Planned development with tables structured in a star schema
•	Organisation-wide conformed dimensions
•	Moreover, how to apply all this theory to your actual models
