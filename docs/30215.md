## Title: 12 ways to write badly performing T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Database performance is a hot topic and there are often questions asked pertaining to the best way to write T-SQL queries. 

In this presentation, the attendee will NOT be shown the best manner in which to write queries but rather numerous ways of how to write poorly performing queries, with the hope that the attendee  will obtain an understanding of what NOT to do.  

The user will be guided through each query, be shown why itâ€™s not the optimal way of doing things and then shown a well-written query that achieves the same results.
