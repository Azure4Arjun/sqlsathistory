## Title: Basket Analysis using BI Office and Analysis Services Tabular Edition 
## Abstract:
### There are several articles available on the web showing how to perform associative analysis (or Basket Analysis or who bought what products with what!) using Analysis Services that rely on special configuration of dimensions to perform the required queries, using custom MDX to work around limitations in Microsoftâ€™s own tool set. In this session Pyramid analytics will show how to use BI Office to easily build an adhoc Analysis Services Tabular Edition analytic data set and perform associative analysis using the unique features of BI Office.
