## Title: Enterprise Power BI - Development Lifecycle [VIDEO]
## Abstract:
### When your development team is up to a certain size and often no matter what size it is you want to start following best development practices. These include things like source control, multiple environments, deployment processes and governance.

As Power BI content is developed using Power BI Desktop and not Visual Studio as most Microsoft BI solutions are these things can get tricky. 

In this session we will look at what Power BI has to offer when it comes to development lifecycle. We will look at the different options available to the developer when it comes to source control, dev, test and production and deployment of Power BI content. We will then look at the different options when it comes to distribution of content to the end user. Lastly, we will look at governance and see how it is possible to secure the content and audit the usage of Power BI.
