## Title: Handling Data Error in a Data Flow
## Abstract:
### It can be frustrating to build an SSIS package with a data flow task and have data related errors where you can't identify the row or column that caused the error because of the cryptic or generic error messages presented to you by SSIS and the driver.  How do you find out what caused error?  Is there a way to get a better error message?  Can I identify the rows?  We'll go over a method I developed to handle error rows  using a script task (at one time upgraded to a custom component) so the offending data can be identified and corrected.  We will discuss ways to correct the problems in an automated fashion.  We will discuss other options in addition to my solution.  

Prerequisites:

Experience developing SSIS packages
T-SQL Experience
Basic .NET knowledge
