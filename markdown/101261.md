## Speaker: Dustin Dorsey
## Title: Azure Cost Management
## Abstract:
### One of the benefits of the cloud is the ability to be able to create resources quickly and on-demand as you need them. However, without proper control and monitoring, this can quickly generate some not-so-pleasant surprises when your bill arrives. In this session, I want to show you how you can create governance around your Azure environment to avoid these surprises and start getting the most from your spend while still being able to maintain the flexibility that makes the cloud so valuable. We will discuss how you can allocate costs to specific areas and create more accountability in your organization using things such as tagging. We will also dive heavily into the Azure Cost Management + Billing portion of the portal and talk about analyzing spends and how you can create more visibility to your organization. We will also look at creating and using budgets, alerting around billing\spends, and how to review and interpret the cost saving recommendations that Azure provides.
