## Title: Introduction To Column Level Encryption
## Abstract:
### With the new data security standards and legislation, encryption has become a necessity in todayâ€™s business world.  This session will introduce the new encryption options in SQL Server and then narrow the focus to column level encryption (not so new).  The session will include slides and discussions to introduce concepts and will also have a live demo of a simple implementation of column level encryption.  This is intended for anyone who is interested in SQL Server encryption, or those who need to implement some sort of encryption as part of their overall database information security strategy.
