## Title: SQL Server OLTP - Monitoring and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### This session will start from the basics of troubleshooting in SQL Server.Then move into  a deeper level of monitoring and  troubleshooting in online transaction processing databases .We will be looking  into performance bottleneck identification (blocking, system resource contention, application design problems, queries or stored procedures that have long execution times), tuning queries, CPU highjackers, memory leaks and many more bad things which can ruin  your SQL Server instance. We are going to use SQL Server built-in tools such as activity monitor, DMV's, reports, query optimizer and other third-party tools to identify and troubleshoot SQL Server.
