## Title: Does everyone hate replication?
## Abstract:
### Transactional replication has been around for a dogs age and most people have grown to hate the old girl. Not everyone though. Those of us that have applied ourselves to the technology have grown to love it.
This session will walk you through the basics of what replication is, why and when you should use it 
Next we will walk through some of the extra little toys that replication allows:
--)Tweaking the target table
--)Using custom stored procedures rather than standard ones
--)Procedure replication rather than table replication
