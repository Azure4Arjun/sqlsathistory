# Does This Look Weird?  The Importance Of Baselining
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tracy Boggiano
## Title: Does This Look Weird?  The Importance Of Baselining
## Abstract:
### How do you know when your server is on fire?  Without a set of known-good measurements to compare against, you don’t.  This session will show you how to capture a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance and help you decide what to capture, and where to store it. Finally we will put it all together by walking through a scenario using the captured baseline data to identify a problem.

# Indexing Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Steve Hood
## Title: Indexing Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### What are indexes and how does SQL Server use them?  Discuss the types of indexes that are available, and go in depth into heaps, clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes.  Why does SQL Server choose an index, and how does it make your queries run faster?  If you're a good fit to be in this session then columnstore, hash, and XML indexes aren't a good fit for you, so they will not get much more than an honorable mention.

# CONVERT_IMPLICIT is a hidden danger
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Alex Grinberg
## Title: CONVERT_IMPLICIT is a hidden danger
## Abstract:
### Abstract: The CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator is part of an execution plan. When an execution plan has a CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator, this is a signal that “your statement has a problem”. This presentation will show you how to detect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator; how to find the statement that causes conversion, and what DMVs can help to solve the problem. It will also show you the solution to collect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator across the servers.

# Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too
## Abstract:
### We hear it in every session and every webinar “…test…” regardless of it being upgrades, new code, performance tuning or any of a thousand changes.  Once we confirm nothing breaks., we don’t need to check anything else, nothing could possibly change the results, right?  What about load on the database(s) in question or the server as a whole?  In this session four readily available tools, distributed replay, Hammer DB, SQL Query Stress and oStress will be introduced.  The session will cover how to use the tools as well as which situations they shine in.  Once introductions are made, we will spend a little time with two of my favorites, HammerDB and SQL Query Stress.  Join me as we apply a little heat to our SQL Servers.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Recovery and Backup for Beginners
## Abstract:
### We all know that backups are important. But are we building a backup strategy that can recover in a manner that meets business needs? All too often, we plan a backup strategy without a recovery strategy.

In this session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will start with understanding the recovery strategy and work toward implementing the right backups to meet that recovery strategy.  He'll also set the record straight around some very common myths around database recovery and backups.

# Finding more space for your tight environment.
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Thomas Chan
## Title: Finding more space for your tight environment.
## Abstract:
### If you do not have enough space  in your hard disk and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I will use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.

# Tools for the DBA Newbie: What I Wish I Had Known Years Ago
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Ryan Booz
## Title: Tools for the DBA Newbie: What I Wish I Had Known Years Ago
## Abstract:
### Are you an DBA newbie looking for tools to improve your product and client experience?

In this session, you’ll be equipped with tools to improve query tuning, indexing tuning, and naming standards. You’ll understand helpful built-in technologies that often go unused, server setup practices, and performance logging. And you’ll hear about the best blogs to follow and where to get help from the community.

I’ve learned all of this gradually, but I’m happy to give you a head start. I’ll share insights that I’ve gained transforming our 18-year old, single-tenant database into a thriving multi-tenant SaaS environment. This talk is intentionally broad, demonstrating how we retooled our database and the wealth of information we discovered along the way.   If you are just starting your SQL Server performance journey, this talk will give you at least one thing to dig into on Monday morning.

# Cross Tabs  Pivots - Much More Than Just Converting Rows to Columns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: Cross Tabs  Pivots - Much More Than Just Converting Rows to Columns
## Abstract:
### This session covers and compares the PIVOT operator to an ancient but very high performance pivoting method known as CROSS TABs.  Single and double column pivots will be covered and the “secret” to quickly making CROSS TABs is “Copy’n’Paste” easy.  We’ll also introduce a couple of “Black Arts” techniques called “Pre-Aggregation” and “Divide’n’Conquer” to build a quarterly report for 1 year from 10 years and 10 MILLION rows of data in just half a second.

If time allows, we’ll also discover that you can very quickly format reports as pretty as you’ll see in SSRS without using SSRS.

Don't let the "Intermediate" rating of this session scare you beginners away because we start at the ground floor and work our way up to some very high performance code.  Even if you already know how to use PIVOT or CROSS TABs, you won’t want to miss this one.

# Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)
Event Date: 30-09-2017 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!

## Speaker: Slava Murygin
## Title: SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.
## Abstract:
### For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.

In the other corner, stands a scrappy re-invigorated Microsoft with a new focus on making the cloud smarter.

Both are feverishly working on creating compelling solutions for developers to build intelligent solutions upon. Is one better than the other? What are each one’s strengths and weaknesses?

And what does Google have up its sleeve?

Come to this session to get a first hand account of a former Microsoft evangelist now working at an AWS partner startup, who promises to keep it a good clean fight!

## Abstract:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

# Geo Location of Twitter messages in Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#636---Pittsburgh-2017)

## Speaker: Rayis Imayev
## Title: Geo Location of Twitter messages in Power BI
## Abstract:
### There are several custom solutions that make Twitter messages analysis possible in Power BI. And with a recent addition of the Campaign/Brand Management for Twitter solution template for Power BI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-templates/brand-management-twitter/) it's getting even less complicated to get into this social media mainstream data exploration.

This solution has several components:
- Logic App passes tweet into an Azure Function
- Azure Function enriches tweet and writes it to Azure SQL
- Azure Function also calls Azure ML experiment running Python script to work out sentiment of tweet
- Power BI imports data into it from Azure SQL and renders pre-defined reports

However, Geo location for twitter messages is not available (if we want to filter them by a particular country). Let's try to explore with live demos if we can customize this Azure solution and add a Country filter to our Power BI reports based on live tweet data.

# DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016

## Speaker: Bert Wagner
## Title: DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.
