## Abstract:
### New version of the popular PowerShell+SQL Server presentation (presented in over 6 SQL Saturdays  User Group events). PowerShell is a command-line scripting language primarily designed for system administration  development. Unlike VBScript or DOS batch files, PowerShell is built upon the .NET Platform which makes it customizable and extensible. This introductory session will show the new PowerShell 3.0 language  scripts and how it can be used for SQL Server 2012 administration (using SMO  WMI providers) and development (ADO.Net  OLEDB providers).
