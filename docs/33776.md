## Abstract:
### An entry level session regarding SQL Server statistics and the importance of their accuracy.

Will cover at a high level and provide examples regarding the histogram, string stats, and density in relation to their function in the estimation process. Will provide scenarios on how out of date stats can generate a bad plan and maintenance principals that can be applied to avoid bad plan generation.
