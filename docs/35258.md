## Title: IIS, ASP\ASP.NET,  SQL Security HowTo
## Abstract:
### By now we all know that we should use Windows Authentication to connect to SQL Server from our IIS applications...but most of us don't know how. This session aims to clear up the confusion by demonstrating the ways that ASP  ASP.NET applications can be configured to make secure connections from different versions of IIS so that we can keep our connections secure and our DBAs happy.
