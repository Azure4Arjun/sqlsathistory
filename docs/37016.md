## Abstract:
### Speaker Moderator Melody Zacharias
Panelists Cindy Gross, Julie Koesmarno, TBD

Panel: How is your business impacted when women are underrepresented in tech? Women are interested, why arenâ€™t they working in IT? Why is the number of women in IT decreasing? How does subtle/implicit bias affect this? What can you personally do about it? Why should you care? We can all help make our businesses more productive, our work culture more pleasant, and our employees and coworkers happier.
