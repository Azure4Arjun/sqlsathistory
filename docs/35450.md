## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: SQL Saturday Super Short Session II
## Abstract:
### This session is actually 4 sessions in one.  Speakers will each take 15 minutes to demonstrate something in SQL Server; it could be shortcuts in Management Studio, setting up and using a particular 3rd-party tool, or a code snippet.  Slide decks are discouraged; the focus is on demonstrating "how-to" do something.
