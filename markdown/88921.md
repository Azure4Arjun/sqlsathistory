## Title: Extend Power BI with Python
## Abstract:
### Most developers use Power BI desktop to design the visuals and publish to the Azure service for production. 

Out of the box, Power BI has 29 visuals.  There are 208 custom visuals that can be down loaded from Appsource.Microsoft.com. 

While there are many choices, the business problem might not have an out of the box visual that can be customized the way you want.  How do you solve this problem?

This is where the custom scripting with Python visual comes in.  

At the end of the presentation you will know which libraries that you can use to extend your toolbox for both on premise and the azure service.
