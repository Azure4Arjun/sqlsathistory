## Title: The Top 8 Reasons for Your Transaction Performance Problems
## Abstract:
### Transaction is running slow! How many times have you seen this message on your production system or heard it from users? Itâ€™s time to isolate and resolve these issues!

Typical reasons for transaction delays include slow transaction logs, page splits, blocking, over-indexing, and even some configuration settings of your database or instance. Query-tuning tips are slightly different than those for transactions, and this session is about OLTP performance troubleshooting. See some typical scenarios of transaction delays and the reasons behind them. This session will help you in your performance troubleshooting efforts and improve your level of confidence.
