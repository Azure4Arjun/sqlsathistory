## Speaker: Thomas Hütter
## Title: Next first steps - selected applications of R
## Abstract:
### You enjoyed the walk-through for R newbies, now you want to take the next steps
and get your eyes and hands on some R code?

Let's elaborate on two topics you might have seen in my "From SQL to R and
beyond" presentation, plus we'll check who obeys Benford's law and who doesn't.

Here are the three subjects that this slightly code-heavy session will cover: 
• How to create dynamic T-SQL using R functions, for example to query your multi-company database 
• Visualizations in R based on shapefiles (those geographic polygons) and some choropleth technique 
• Applying Benford's law, which actually is not about crime and fraud, but may help you to detect them
