## Title: Not All Data is Relational: An introduction to Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### In this session we will talk about the pros and cons of using a non-relational database and where it might fit best into your applications. We will then demonstrate these concepts using Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service. Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions worldwide. You can also take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access using your favorite API including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, or Gremlin.
