## Title: Using Excel 2010 as Your Analysis Services Client
## Abstract:
### Self service BI can be a snap even when you build your data models in SQL Server Analysis Services by using PowerPivot for Excel to compress, query and report on the data.  This session will begin by showing how to create a cube in Analysis Services and then connect that cube to PowerPivot for Excel. Once in PowerPivot, we will see how to connect this data to other data sources and augment the cube data with calculated DAX expressions.  We will close by showing from a user's point-of-view how easy it is to manipulate the data to create a variety of different reports and charts with no code.
