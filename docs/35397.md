## Title: Understanding SQL Injection (DB Devs and Admins)
## Abstract:
### SQL injection is a term you've heard often, but do you really understand what it means for a database developer or administrator? Canâ€™t you just leave that to the application developers to deal with?

This session will help you understand what SQL injection is, why it is a risk for your database, and how to guard against it.
