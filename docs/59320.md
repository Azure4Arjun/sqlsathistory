## Title: Loading SQL Server Data with Powershell
## Abstract:
### Powershell has become the defacto standard for scripting Microsoft products.  However, putting data in text files doesn’t scale.  Here I’m going to show you the ins and outs of loading data into SQL Server using Powershell for the purpose of centralizing collections.  We’re going to cover RBAR as well as bulk operations and the types of things you need to take into consideration in an enterprise setting.  This is a no holds barred session taught by an enterprise SQL Server scripting expert.  You can’t afford to miss this session if you do any level of scripting in your shop.
