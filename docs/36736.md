## Title: Importing and Exporting Spatial Data into SQLServer
## Abstract:
### Getting spatial data into and out of SQLServer can be difficult. Learn how to leverage spatial data in a variety of common formats, including CSV, ESRI shapefiles, KML, and others. In addition to discussing tools native to SQLServer, we will also explore a few widely used FOSS (free and open source) spatial utilities.
