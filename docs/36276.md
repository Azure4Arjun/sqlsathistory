## Title: De-Mystifying Query Plans: Focus on the Cardinality Estimator
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server optimizer is an engineering marvel.  The intelligence that is built into the product is mind bending.  But, sometimes queries don't run as expected.  Without a basic understanding of statistics and the cardinality estimator you'll never know why.

This session will walk through an anomaly of the cardinality estimator called The Ascending Key Problem.  A major focus of the discussion will include how the optimizer uses statistics to estimate row counts, which is ultimately used to build optimal query plans.

At the end of this session you will know how to assess the state of the statistics for your indexes and columns; you will know how to look at your query plans in a way that will help prevent poor query performance BEFORE the query executes; and you will better understand how the optimizer estimates row counts.
