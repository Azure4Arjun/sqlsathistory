## Title: Encrypting Data Within SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep your company out of the headlines? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt? What else can you do to protect your sensitive data? 

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption, and Always Encrypted. While we look at the encryption options, we will review both on-premise and cloud offerings. This session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share experiences implementing the encryption. Also, letâ€™s learn how to classify data which should be protected and how to audit sensitive data usage. 

You will leave this session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance. Also, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.
