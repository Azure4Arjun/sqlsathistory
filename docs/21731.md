## Title: Securing a Multi-Database Application
## Abstract:
### It is difficult enough to implement database security when dealing with only a single database. If multiple databases are involved, the task of providing a security model that follows industry best practices seems insurmountable.

In this session, we will do a quick review of access security best practices and then dive into the four different methods a DBA can use to tighten cross database access security. For each one we will walk through a demo and talk about how to implement it in your own environment. We will close the session with a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods.
