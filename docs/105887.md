## Title: Demystification of Calculation Groups in Analysis Services Tabular
## Abstract:
### Calculation Groups is a new feature for Analysis Services Tabular and Power BI Premium. They can significantly reduce the number of redundant measures by grouping common measure expressions as elements of a calculation. At the webinar, we will look at creating such groups, managing them, their limitations, and how to use them from Power BI Desktop.
