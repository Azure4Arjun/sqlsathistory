## Title: New Frontiers: Platform Independent Full Stack Development
## Abstract:
### For years, those of us who wanted to use non-Windows-based machines to do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM or have had to go without a local copy of SQL Server. The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM or work arounds! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database back-end while introducing platform independent tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their platform independent counterparts.
