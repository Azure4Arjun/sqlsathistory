## Title: Serverless Cloud Computing: Promises and Pitfalls
## Abstract:
### You're hearing more and more about serverless computing, but is it really the panacea that cloud vendors make it out to be? Come learn about the promises and pitfalls of serverless cloud computing based on real-world use.

In this session we will:
- Discover where all the cloud servers disappeared to 
- Define what "serverless" actually means
- Discuss use cases that are a good fit for serverless (there will be code!)
- Drive through a top ten list of pitfalls to look out for, and how those pitfalls can enable us to design more resilient applications

This session will provide useful insights for IT decision-makers exploring where serverless fits in their enterprises and for developers who want to go out and quickly build something.
