## Title: Doing it Yourself: Creating and Publishing A Power BI Custom Visual to AppSource
## Abstract:
### Power BI offers an incredibly extensive custom visualisation framework and the world is (almost) your oyster when it comes to what you can do. There's plenty of great visuals out there already, but what happens when you really want something that just doesn't seem to be out there and... why hasn't someone else built it yet? It can't be that hard to do... right? Can I really do it myself?

This session covers the journey of the conception and development of the Small Multiple Line Chart custom visual, some of the challenges and lessons learned along the way, and the process of self-publishing visuals through the AppSource platform for general availability in the marketplace.
