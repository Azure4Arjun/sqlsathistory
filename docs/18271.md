## Title: SSAS Tabular 2012 vs SSAS Multidimensional OLAP
## Abstract:
### In this presentation, I'll compare the new Tabular Model in SSAS 2012 with the more "traditional" multidimensional OLAP in SSAS.  I'll show which of the 2 approaches works better in specific scenarios, and why you'd want to use one method over the other for certain applications.  If you are trying to decide which approach to use, or if you are an experienced OLAP developer who wants to know the pros and cons of moving to the Tabular Model, this presenation is for you!
