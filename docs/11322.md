## Title: Preparing Data for Analysis as Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### The new Tabular Model in SQL Server 2012 is being touted as a powerful analytic engine that is faster and easier to implement than traditional cubes using Analysis Service.  In this session Carlos Bossy will demonstrate how to develop analytic models using your existing data sources and will discuss best practices for preparing data so that it can be effectively used as a Tabular database.  In addition to creating the model, Carlos will show you how to quickly add measures, hierarchies, and calculated columns to provide a rich user experience.
