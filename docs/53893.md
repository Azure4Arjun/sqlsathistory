## Title: PostgreSQL as a Document Storage for .NET applications
## Abstract:
### In a relational database system we must define a schema before adding data to a database but sometimes we need to store and (that is more important) query semi-structured data. And of course it would be great if we could use the same interface to access both structured and semi-structured data. The session will describe how to solve it via building IQueryable document storage for .NET applications using PostgreSQL and jsonb.
