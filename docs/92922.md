## Title: How to be polite with databases when going serverless
## Abstract:
### Like it wasn't enough that just anyone could use an ORM and start molesting a database, nowadays just anyone can use serverless and communicate with a database... and use ORM...
First of all, we're gonna focus on how to communicate with a database from your serverless system presuming that there aren't any parallel requests to the database. In that way, we'll first polish cold starts, memory/CPU consumption, and basically everything we need to worry about now when we're not running our code on servers with 10+ cores, and tens of GB of RAM.
Once we're done with the first task, we'll end up with something that can quickly and effortlessly communicate with our database. Which is perfect, except in cases where we handle thousands or more of parallel requests to the database which isn't scalable as serverless is.
That brings us to our second task- making sure our serverless system won't DDoS our databases :)
Come and find out how to approach this problems ;)
