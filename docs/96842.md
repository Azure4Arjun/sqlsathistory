## Title: Predicting the NFL with SQL Server 2017 ML Services
## Abstract:
### Every wonder if you could predict the outcome of the Superbowl? Or know the score of any game? The NFL is perfect for predictive analytics: it has a fixed time frame, a set playing field, and rigorous rules.  These are characteristics we can only envy in the business world. With the aid of ML Services in SQL Server 2017, we have the strength of statistical languages like R and Python right within the database engine. In this session, John will demonstrate the steps for successfully preparing the data, then run a regression model to predict the scores for the current weekâ€™s scheduled NFL game.  Want to know if your team is likely to win against the spread?  Wanna bet?
