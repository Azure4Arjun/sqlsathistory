## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Hierarchies and graphs are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Networks
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 came with a different approach: Graph Database, which are further improved in SQL 2019.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies and graphs into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.
