## Title: SQL Server Administration for new DBAs and non-DBA
## Abstract:
### This session walks through a SQL Server installation, the post setup configuration, a basic security review, configuring a maintenance plan and basic performance monitoring. All with no PowerPoint slides. Instead we'll walk through our SQL Server setup and configuration checklist and demonstrate everything we talk about. This session is great for new database administrators or part-time DBAs or anyone looking for a refresher. Experienced DBA's will learn something too! You'll get a copy of the checklist during the session and you'll get a link to download a copy for later.
