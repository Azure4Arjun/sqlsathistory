## Title: Azure Analysis Services – Multidimensional solutions in the cloud
## Abstract:
### Virtually all of today’s data solutions are hybrid solutions – partially in the cloud, partially on premises – as organizations attempt to fulfill an ‘all in the cloud’ mandate.  The reality is that cloud platforms like Azure do many things very well, but not all things, and functional gaps remain which complicate and sometimes prevent a full migration away from on premises environments.

Azure Analysis Services (AAS) is a good example of this reality – it works very well for many applications but is limited to Tabular Models and cost can explode if those models are not created thoughtfully.  And, what is the path to Azure for my multidimensional cubes? Do I care about Azure Analysis Services if I use Power BI?  As always the answer to these questions is a clear and absolute ‘it depends’.

In this session we’ll explore Azure Analysis Services functionality, fit in various solutions, and gaps and techniques that are important to consider when implementing AAS.
