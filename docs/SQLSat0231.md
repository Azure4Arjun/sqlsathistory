In this session, we will cover how the PAL tool can be used to produce a rich HTML output of your perfmon capture exposing performance risks and trends with full documentation on what the perf counters means to your given workload. We will cover how to leverage existing PAL templates on SQL Server and other technologies. We will discuss how to adjust existing templates and how to create your own template for performance baselining.

# A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#231---Cocoa-Beach-2013)
Event Date: 27-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Anthony Sammartino
## Title: A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover how PowerPivot and BISM Tabular complement each other in the domains of self-service and corporate BI. Let's face it, The Finance department does not have the expertise to model a database for reporting, and IT doesn't have the expertise in advanced financial calculations that the executive team is interested in. To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.
