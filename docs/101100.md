## Title: Calculate: With great power there must also come...great responsibility
## Abstract:
### Power BI DAX and checking performance and adjust for faster, more accurate results.

We will cover:

•                  Calculate and advanced Switch True 
•                  Variables
•                  Tools- the where, how to connect, and basics to look for 
•                  Modeling Considerations and DAX for relationships

As data and models become more advanced, there are performance pitfalls that are easy to fall into when weighing the ever important 'Can I' vs 'Should I'. I am happy to share the learning resources I used to overcome these and how I fixed the many mistakes that I made along the way.
