## Title: Building Composable Query Abstractions in TSQL
## Abstract:
### A common critique of SQL is that it can be hard to write queries with reusable parts, something which is trivial in many programming languages. For example, even something simple, like running a query with different set of selections can be tricky to express. 

This presentation will show how this problem can be avoided by taking a data-first approach and using some advanced TSQL constructs. Along the way, we will also go over how to do GraphQL-like queries in TSQL.
