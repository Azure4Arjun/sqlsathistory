## Title: SQL Server and R for real-time predictions
## Abstract:
### Embedding your R (and soon Python!) models in SQL Server enables you to add predictive capabilities to your applications and your analytics without adding expensive components or going outside your network via expensive API calls.

In this demo-packed talk, youâ€™ll see how you can go from a model built in R to making predictions on the fly in SQL Server 2016.
