## Title: DataSets, Making the Perfect DataSet Efficient in SQL Server 2016!
## Abstract:
### I will teach you the world of making DataSets. The use of T-SQL in SQL Server provides many ways to utilize the data you already have.
In this 60 minute session we will go through the progression of useful techniques to manipulate a record set.
Whether you use tables,temp tables, CTE's and/or Table variables, we will find the right situation for each one.
We will also take a look at 2016's SQL Server's new Columnstore indexes on temp tables if and when they are useful.
