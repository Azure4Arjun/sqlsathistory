Event Date: 20-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
## Abstract:
### Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can not be handled with a single simple or complex query.  TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.


I will be covering derived tables, local temporary tables, global temporary tables, table variables, user tables in tempdb, and common table expressions in my examples using the AdventureWorks database.  The pros and cons of each contruct will be examined.  Advanced options like enabling trace flag 1118 will be explored.

## Title: Database design for mere developers 
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012: Efficient and effective database design is so important that leaving it solely to the DBAs is simply not a solution. We as developers will more than likely have to create applications to access the data stores and as such must ensure that all application related considerations are taken into account within the database design.In this session, (aimed at software developers) we shall be touching upon several concepts of special importance to the developer. These include database development "patterns and anti-patterns", final proofing of design and creating versatile deployment scripts that can and will be utilized in future endeavors.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice
## Abstract:
### A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we will gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.

## Title: SQL2012 Query  Procedure Call Statistics
## Abstract:
### Did you know that SQL Server keeps track of almost every call you make to the database instance? Do you know what information it collects and more importantly how to use that information effectively? Don’t get this confused with statistics used by the optimizer to generate the query plan. These are the stats gathered during the executions.  In this session we will show you how to identify the query activity on your instance and allow you to make smart decisions on which ones to address first and get the biggest ROI on your precious time. Please note that most of this is applicable to SQL2008 as well.

# Faster  Stored Procedures and Functions
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#146---Nashua-2012)
Event Date: 20-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Andrew Novick
## Title: Faster  Stored Procedures and Functions
## Abstract:
### Stored procedures and functions are the mainstay of SQL Server coding. This presentation will show techniques to improve their performance.  We’ll start with techniques to learn where the time is really going using standard server traces and the new Extended Events.  Once we know where the time is going we look at strategies to decrease it:
•	Managing indexes on temp tables
   -	Why heaps are often the best choice for temp tables
   -	How building non-clustered indexes on heaps is faster than building clustered indexes.
•	Rewriting scalar and multi-statement functions to as inline functions
Each technique is illustrated with examples drawn from real cases in Andy's work.
