## Speaker: Andrew Collier
## Title: Web Scraping
## Abstract:
### Often the data you want is available somewhere on the internet. It might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across many pages (possibly hundreds or thousands of pages!). But you want those data consolidated locally in a convenient format.

What would Ragnar do? He'd go out, grab the data and bring it home.

The contemporary Internet Viking uses Web Scraping to systematically extract information from web pages. This is the battle plan:

- Sharpening the Axe: Understanding of the structure of an HTML document.
- Preparing the Longships: Using the DOM to select elements.
- Doing Battle: Manual scraping.
- Stashing the Treasure: Storing data.
- The Journey Home: Automated scraping with Scrapy.
- Triumphant Return: Driving a browser using Selenium.

By the end of the tutorial you'll be ready to pillage and plunder large swathes of the internet.

Come along and make Ragnar proud.

This tutorial will be suitable for Vikings with low to moderate levels of Python experience.
