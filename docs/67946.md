## Title: Learning on a Budget
## Abstract:
### Traditional classroom training is not cheap.  Many companies do not provide this training to their employees.  The cost of this training is often beyond a personâ€™s financial means.  To add to this challenge, over the past few years, Microsoft has added a lot of new technology increasing the amount of training to keep up.

There is a log of great training opportunities outside the traditional classroom.  This session will go over the these options to allow you the opportunity to keep up with the technology.
