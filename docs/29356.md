## Title: Hybrid Database Solutions with SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### With so much interest in Cloud technology, where does it really fit in, and what is the role of the DBA and Database Developer? What is available in SQL Azure, as it compares to SQL Server? Can you leave some data on-premise, and put other data in the cloud? Buck shows you the ins and outs of SQL Azure, how to connect to it, manage it, what the limitations are, and real-world examples of architectures that work.
