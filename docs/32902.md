## Title: BI Dashboards in Sql Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Dashboards are a great way to highlight what is most important to your organization.  An interface which brings together data from multiple data sources in a high level format can be a vital tool for decision makers.  See how this can be accomplished using tables, charts, and a little bit of code in SQL Reporting Services.
