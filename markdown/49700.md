## Title: Pester the Tester: PowerShell Bugs Beware!
## Abstract:
### So you've been developing PowerShell for a while, or perhaps you're taking over maintenance of an existing set of scripts. It would be great to get extra confidence in your scripts through testing, but how? You're in luck, there's a new module in town, Pester! 

Pester is a friendly testing framework designed for testing your PowerShells scripts and modules. In this session you'll be introduced to Pester. You'll see how to use Pester to uncover bugs, as well as using it for test driven development. Make your own PowerShell more robust through the use of Pester. Kill those PowerShell bugs, dead!
