## Title: Hidden aspects of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Nowadays we are dealing with super efficient auto-tuning database servers but our queries sometimes run very slow. Everything looks ok but in our monitoring tools we can see higher resource consumption, wait statistics associated with locks or tempdb activity etc. What is the reason of this? During the session I will show few not very well-known aspects of work with SQL Server that can affect performance of specific queries and entire instance. During the session you will find a lot of practical demonstrations and tips that will help you diagnose specific problems and errors.
