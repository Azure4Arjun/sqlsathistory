## Speaker: Alexander Karl
## Title: JSON    XML;  since SQL 2016 it is important to weigh respective advantage
## Abstract:
### The session begins with „JSON“ and shows with a syntax-comparison the similarities to XML.
Both the different operational scenarios and the technical background
of JSON and XML, however, require a different range of functions and language.
Therefore, initially, as far as practicable the parallels will be demonstrated.
Especially the T-SQL  extensions  „FOR JSON“  and  „OpenJSON“  are very similarly implemented in comparison to „FOR XML“ and „OpenXML“.
Furthermore the new functions  „IsJSON“,  „JSON_VALUE“ and  „JSON_QUERY“  are now contained in T-SQL. Do they also have these as T-SQL functions for XML or can these results be calculated with XML-methods?
Additionally, XML has some more features which concern saving ( and indexing ) and requesting 
(in particular with XQuery) in relational tables. These will also be demonstrated exemplary. 
The goal of the session is to show, when which language is of advantage in which case.

## Speaker: Enrico van de Laar
## Title: Introducing the SQL Server 2016 Query Store
## Abstract:
### With the release of the public preview versions of SQL Server 2016 we were finally able to play with, in my opinion, one of the most exciting new features in SQL Server 2016, the Query Store! The Query Store serves as a flight recorder for your query workload and provides valuable insights into the performance of your queries. It doesn’t stop there however, using the performance metrics the Query Store records, we can decide which Execution Plan SQL Server should use when executing a specific query. If those two features aren’t enough, the Query Store provides all this information inside easy-to-use reports and Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) removing a great deal of the complexity of query performance analysis.
During this session we will take a thorough look at the Query Store, it’s architecture, the build-in reporting, DMVs and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store. No matter if you are a DBA or developer, the Query Store has information that can help you!

## Speaker: Marcin Szeliga
## Title: Revolutionary R integration in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### The R integration brings a lot of benefits and new scenarios to on premises data platform systems:
•	R can greatly simplify collection of different data.
•	Data manipulation and preparation can also be way easier with R.
•	You can use R to quickly explore and visualize data. 
•	Last but not least, R brings the whole power of modern data mining techniques to SQL Server.   
As if this was not enough, you can use familiar user interface and SQL Server Enterprise R Services to work with large datasets and multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-process computations. So, even if you don’t know R at all, come and see how natural this language is for everybody who already think in rows and columns.

## Title: DevOps'ing or how to build, release and provision environments on
## Abstract:
### During this session we will talk about DevOps practices in general and also see some demos about how to automate your builds, how to manage your releases, how to manage different environments and create them on a fly.

I will show the demo app which consists of 3 parts - client app, server api and database. I will show how to automate builds for all parts of your project. I will show how to provide different configuration settings for different environments. I will show how you can create new environment on a fly, deploy your app there, run some integration and UI automation tests, etc. I will show how to automate all routine stuff and focused more on innovation, not maintenance.
