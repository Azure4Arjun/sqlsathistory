## Title: Achieve More in Less Time by Using SQLPS
## Abstract:
### Letâ€™s face it, using SQLPS prior to SQL Server 2016 was like installing training wheels on a Ducati.   Then, some community feedback was incorporated before SQL 2016 shipped and presto, SQLPS is actually useful all of a sudden.

There is a faster way to manage and even SQL Servers using PowerShell.  I will show you what the new features in SQLPS and why you will probably find it useful, even if you aren't a "DBA".
