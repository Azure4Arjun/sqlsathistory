## Speaker: AJ Mendo
## Title: Standardize Your Environment With Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Are all your servers standardized across your environment? Do you manually click the next button when installing 
SQL Server? Do you manually create and configuring your routine maintenance? Are your SQL Agent Jobs owned by 
other DBAs in your group? Do you know when jobs fail? Or discover them accidentally? Do you have a standardized 
way to deploy updates?

We will discuss all these things and some others during this session and hopefully when we come out the other 
side some of this will make your life easier.
