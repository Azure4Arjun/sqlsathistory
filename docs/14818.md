## Title: Windows Azure SQL Databases - Lessons Learned
## Abstract:
### There seems to be a perception that working with Windows Azure SQL Databases is just a case of redirecting your connection strings to the cloud. In this session, Greg will explain why that isn't the case, explain what is and isn't provided by WASD, and detail lessons that he has learned from working with this environment.
