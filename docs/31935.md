## Title: Obliterate Excessive Blocking and Deadlocking
## Abstract:
### Your databases are getting bigger and busier and you need to make the most out of the hardware you have. On your servers, excessive locking can often cause timeouts and database traffic jams! In this session I explore steps you can take to address unexpected locking issues. I also explain what steps to take to avoid contention in the future. Lots of examples taken from experience.
