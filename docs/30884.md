## Title: Developing Recursive Queries
## Abstract:
### In this session, we explore how recursion simplifies some programming tasks and how recursive queries can be developed in Microsoft SQL Server using Common Table Expressions. We will begin with a brief introduction to recursion with the classic factorial example and extend this to the set-based issues encountered in SQL development. Then, we will present several real-world problems where recursive solutions can be used in place of temp tables and cursors.
