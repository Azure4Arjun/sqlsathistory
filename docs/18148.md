## Speaker: Kevin Goode
## Title: Down on the Farm
## Abstract:
### Elastic computing, horizontal scaling, always on, shared services: these are great buzz words and sound so easy when described in CIO magazine.  Implementing and managing these concepts is no easy task.  This session will take an in-depth look at the implementation of a SSIS server farm and a SSAS server farm. The discussion points will include: how to load balance across the farm, how to achieve always on, how to scale out, how to automate the whole thing and what developers need to do to use the farm.
