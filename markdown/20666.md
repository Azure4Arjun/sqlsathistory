## Title: Putting Quality Back Into Your Data
## Abstract:
### This session introduces Data Quality Services, a new feature of SQL Server 2012.  One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication.  Sometimes you even need to consolidate data from more than one source that may have different standards and format.  Microsoftâ€™s solution in SQL 2012 is Data Quality Services (DQS).  In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data.  I will end the session with a set of demonstration of how DQS works with different data problems to help you put quality back into your data.
