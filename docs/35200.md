## Title: Providing Enhanced Business Value Using Scorecards
## Abstract:
### You hear people talk about scorecards and the differences between scorecards and dashboards.  What are those differences and what do they mean to you?  Scorecards using Microsoft BI tools are not difficult to create, but without proper planning and design they will miss the mark and fail to provide the desired business benefit.  In this session youâ€™ll learn about best practices in creating scorecards, as well as examine some unique client approaches to really get to the heart of the business problem.
