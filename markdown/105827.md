## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: The Curated Data Platform
## Abstract:
### The breadth of data platform options available to us today is staggering: between relational, object, graph, and document databases, we have a wide array of storage options, as well as a huge number of access and analysis tools. This talk will walk you through data platform, data analysis, and data processing options. We'll discuss when to use (and when not to use) Spark, R, Airflow, and Power BI, as well as a range of other interesting tools and technologies. By the end of this talk, you may not have MongoDB or Neo4J, but you will know where they might (or might not!) fit in your environment.
