## Title: Data Storytelling Using Power BI
## Abstract:
### In today's world, data is omnipresent and most organizations are presented with billions of data points every morning. Good analysis parses these numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization or process. In short, it “humanizes” the data by turning raw numbers into a story about the performance. The challenge is to interpret these stories correctly and for that, we need the help of data visualization tools like Microsoft Power BI. 

Join me as I take you through on how to utilize Power BI effectively to tell data stories and engage your audience. Watch and learn some of the top techniques and hacks on making aesthetic as well as relevant Power BI reports for effective storytelling. Also, watch out for some engaging examples of storytelling using Power BI (which also includes the winning report of the Microsoft Power BI Best Report contest!)
