## Title: SSIS for real: A walk through a real world project
## Abstract:
### In this presentation I will walk though a complete real-world SSIS project that pulls data from an AS/400 and converts it to a SQL Server destination. In addition to specific AS/400 conversion issues I will also cover topics like dynamic OLEDB connections, and creating an effective work flow.  Along the way we'll take a look at how I use Derived Columns, Conditional Split, Lookup, and Script components to solve every day conversion issues.
