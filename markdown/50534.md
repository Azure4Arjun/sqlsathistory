## Title: Successfully Migrate Existing Databases to Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### Peoples first impressions have a long lasting effect. This is true, regardless if the first impression is related to technology or not.  Last thing you want to do is leave a bad first impression by having an unsuccessful migration to Azure SQL Database. 

In this session, you will learn how to test migrations for compatibility issues before you start the migration process. This will proactively eliminate road blocks during the migration process.  You will learn what tools are available to make sure migrations successfully meet your existing service level agreements. Finally, you will learn which performance tier is a good starting point for your existing workload and how to monitor your workload to make sure your users have a great experience while you save as much money as possible.
