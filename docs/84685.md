## Title: Columnstore 101: The Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Even though Columnstore Indexes were introduced with SQL Server 2012, their popularity and general use haven't increased nearly as much as their functionality since then.  If you're someone that's not had much experience with Columnstore Indexes and want to learn more about them, this session is perfect for you as I plan to cover the Five Ws of Columnstore Indexes: what they are, when to use them, where they are best utilized, and most importantly why they work so well.  You'll be the "who" and after the session, I expect you'll feel more confident and excited to use this great feature.
