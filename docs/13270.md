## Title: Implementing Data Partitioning and Tiered Storage
## Abstract:
### Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server.
