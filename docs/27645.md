## Title: The Best Practices for Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012 and completely change the way in which we can store and process data using the new columnar format. With SQL Server 2014 and Azure SQL expanding the use of these indexes, it's important to keep in mind the best practices to get the most benefit out of this technology. In this session we will do a quick intro to columnstores and immediately dive into demos on how to load data, modify the index and write queries. All using the best practices to leverage the maximum benefits from these indexes.
