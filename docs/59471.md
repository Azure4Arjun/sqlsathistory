## Title: Introducing SQL Server on Linux
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is from Microsoft, and has been running exclusively on Windows since the early 90s! However, with the increasing usage of cloud computing and wide adoption of Linux in data centers and cloud service providers, Microsoft has decided to bring SQL Server to Linux.

In this session, I'll demonstrate how to set up and test SQL Server on Fedora/Red Hat and Ubuntu/Debian based systems. You'll gain practical insights on how to create your own SQL Server running on Linux and test its usage. I'll compare and contrast of its similarities and differences of SQL Server on these two vastly different operating systems. Come to my talk to keep abreast of this interesting development.
