## Title: What to do before your Power BI report starts getting slow
## Abstract:
### When building a report or dashboard in Power BI and using DirectQuery or Live connection it is important to take into account what will happen when reports are being adopted by the business and the audience grows.

Working with IT there is nothing worse when the business starts complaining. During this session I will show you how to approach the situation when the business already started complaining, what the most common pains appear and where you should be looking before the performance starts degrading. 

We will be looking into measuring different timings, what is important when building reports,  investigating logs and what options you have to this in a structured fashion.
