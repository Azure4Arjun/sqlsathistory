## Title: Building a High Availability SQL Server 2008 R2
## Abstract:
### If you are new to SQL Server 2008 R2, you will learn how to utilize Clustering and Mirroring technologies together to achieve High Availability and minimize data loss in the event of a disaster. In this session, I will show how we minimize downtime while migrating from SQL Server 2005 Cluster to SQL 2008 R2. This session includes real life deployment and upgrade scenarios to achieve high availability and disaster recovery, the lessons learned, and the best practices. Technologies covered include Failover Clustering on Windows Server 2008 R2 and SQL 2008 R2 Database Mirroring.
