## Title: Power BI for absolute beginners
## Abstract:
### Power BI is an environment consisting of several reporting tools and platforms each utilizing different languages and capabilities for data modeling, data insights and report sharing. If you are new to the world of Power BI, this can all get a little overwhelming and leave you feeling confused and frustrated.

This session is designed to get you started writing beautiful reports and dashboards as quickly as possible. We will first lay the groundwork explaining how the whole Power BI stack hangs together, for both on-premises and cloud services and tools, and how you can use them to share your reports.

Next, we will focus specifically on how you utilize those reporting tools to create beautiful reports, dashboards, and paginated reports. 

By the end of this session, you will be comfortable connecting to remote data sources, creating your data model, and designing and publishing your first Power BI reports and dashboards.
