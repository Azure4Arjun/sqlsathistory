## Title: CQRS Lite and Otherwise
## Abstract:
### A popular buzzword, CQRS is often misunderstood and more often misused. Less of an architecture, than a set of related techniques and an architectural flavor, it is an important and powerful technique to have in your arsenal. Here we will discuss traditional CQRS, break it down to its essence, and discuss a lightweight alternative by which an application can be created without much of the overhead and a straightforward transition path to a fully CQRS style.
