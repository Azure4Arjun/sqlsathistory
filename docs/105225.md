## Title: DevOps for Azure SQL
## Abstract:
### "But... it worked on my computer!" A good DevOps practice and implementation will help eliminate that unwelcome phrase! Come to this session to learn how to use tools and platforms like Visual Studio Code, Git, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions for a modern, secure and easy-to-use database DevOps experience for Azure SQL. We will use demos to show and evaluate two approaches: first, a code-centric migration-based approach (using DbUp and GitHub Actions), and second, a more complex project/state-based approach (using Visual Studio SQL Projects and Azure DevOps and a locked-down Azure SQL DB) to understand some of the many possibilities for implementing DevOps for Azure SQL.
