## Title: CDC - Change Data Capture in Detail
## Abstract:
### Change data capture records insert, update, and delete activity that is applied to a SQL Server table. This makes the details of the changes available in an easily consumed relational format. Column information and the metadata that is required to apply the changes to a target environment is captured for the modified rows and stored in change tables that mirror the column structure of the tracked source tables.

This session demonstrates the basic concepts, detailed components and implementation strategies of CDC.
The demo is based on a real scenario which has been implemented that way!
