## Title: How to win Kaggle competition and get familiar with machine learning ?
## Abstract:
### Have you heard that knowing machine learning is the easiest way to get rich quickly? Letâ€™s test this statement. Kaggle is the place to do data science projects, why not to start there?
During this session we will solve simple Kaggle competition. Actually, we will submit two solutions. The first made with super-duper deep neural network (black-box approach). Then we will follow proven ML methodologies and solve the problem methodically. All that using SQL Server Machine Learning Services.
Minimum slides and maximum fun guaranteed.
