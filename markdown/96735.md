## Speaker: Pat Phelan
## Title: DR  HA 101, what are they and why do I want them?
## Abstract:
### This session is for the new or "accidental" DBA, and for those who want a gentle introduction to HA  DR. It starts by defining what those letters mean, and takes you to the point where you can frame good questions about your needs and understand the answers to those questions.

This session does not try to discuss all of the details or go deep into the technical requirements. It defines terms and provides an understanding of these topics.
