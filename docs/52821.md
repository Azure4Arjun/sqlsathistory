## Title: Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016: Why, where and how we should use it ?
## Abstract:
### Temporal Data is one of the new features that got released on the new SQL Server 2016 version that will allow users to audit data changes over time. With this feature, it will be possible, to see our records on a "point-in-time" perspective. 
In this session i will cover some scenarios of why we should use this feature, in what kind of system and how we can implement it. 
Also i will show you how we can audit data, or even recover some data that got updated or deleted by mistake.
