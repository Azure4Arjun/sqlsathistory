## Title: DBAs are from Mars,  SharePoint admins are from Ve
## Abstract:
### SharePoint databases are considered a black box - touch them and you lose support. Furthermore, SharePoint leaves an unintelligible track of database names and GUIDs on your server. They are supposed to scale, but how and how much? Here are some techniques DBAs should be aware of to optimize SharePoint performance and scalability. This demo-packed session, based on real-life experiences, will show you how to tune your SQL Server for SharePoint and how to customize your SharePoint installation so that it fits your IT conventions, not the other way around.
