## Title: What is in reality a DAX filter context
## Abstract:
### Often when discussing evaluation context in DAX courses, a complete and in-depth definition of this very important mechanism is not provided. Many times an approximation is given of what the evaluation contexts really are. In this session I will provide some important details on the evaluation contexts to proceed with more complex calculations and get a full understanding of how DAX evaluates the expressions, it is necessary  learn in depth the way the evaluation contexts work and interact in a DAX Formulas
