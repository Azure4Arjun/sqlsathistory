## Title: What treasures are hidden in the Plan Cache?
## Abstract:
### Producing a query plan can be CPU costly process for a SQL Server. To avoid repeating these expensive steps, SQL Server Engine stores its query plans, in the plan cache where they can be reused as needed.

In this session, weâ€™ll look at Plan Cache, what it is and what it contains,  how query plans get into the Cache , how they are reused   and how they get out.
