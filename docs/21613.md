## Title: Analysis Services Half and Half-Half Cube/Half MDX
## Abstract:
### In this intro level session, we'll look at the basics of building a working SSAS Cube, and the basics of MDX calculations.  In constructing a working cube, we will cover key concepts for Analysis Services and MDX, and show you how to construct a basic cube and regular dimension, and a calculated member for Analysis.  We will pack as much information into this session so as to allow you to take away enough to be able to start building cubes and metrics on your own.
