## Title: Monitoring Azure SQL Database with Log Analytics and PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database Is a PAAS service of a database. You can not install agents, Maintenance or Outages are happening without letting us know and the monitoring is hard.
Also, the servers are not available and you need to be creative to monitor it.
Azure gives us Log Analytics. And I build PS scripts and PowerBI dashboards.
In this session, i will go over those solutions and show some examples.
