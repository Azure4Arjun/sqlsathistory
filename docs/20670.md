## Title: Cube World for Flat Table Landers
## Abstract:
### This session will explore the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for DBA’s more comfortable with relational databases.  Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, you will learn how to define your measure and dimensions, define hierarchies, and build functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data.  For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as well for their more demanding models.
