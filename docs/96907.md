## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Operationalize Data Science for Advanced Decision Support
## Abstract:
### Modern-day computing power makes it possible to create sophisticated predictive models that classify data, perform anomaly detection, and predict behaviors and tendencies. 
Using data engineering principles and the latest tools released by Microsoft in Azure Machine Learning service to create a data science framework, you’ll see how to develop predictive models through the entire life cycle and incorporate them into your applications in a way that impacts the decision-making ability of everyone in your organization. 

Through a case study, you’ll learn how to choose a meaningful project with a high likelihood for success, including setting a prediction target and how to use data appropriately and adapt it to the model for maximum results. Best practices will be presented for developing, monitoring, and maintaining predictive models. Integrating predictive models into your architecture will allow you to take a step toward making predictive analytics pervasive in your organization.
