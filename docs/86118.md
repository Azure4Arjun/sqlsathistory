## Speaker: Craig McGregor
## Title: Let's do the DbaOps: Creating automated,  testable installations of SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you know if your development, test and production environments created were equally? 

How many SQL instances are you responsible for? Do you know if they are installed and configured consistently? If a dog ate your SAN, could you rebuild them 'by lunchtime'?

In this presentation we'll walk through a live demo using reusable community resources to automatically install, configure and verify the installation of SQL Server(s) that implement best practices using Powershell Desired State Configuration, dbachecks.io and other community resources.
