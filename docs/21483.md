## Title: SQL 2012 AlwaysOn Quickstart
## Abstract:
### In this presentation I'll explain what the new SQL 2012 AlwaysOn high availability and disaster recovery solution is all about.  I'll talk about the different levels of protection it provides through Windows Clustering, SQL Clustering, and Availability Groups.  We'll discuss how these three things come together to protect your databases. We'll finish with a dive into availability group configuration and the new capabilities it gives us.
