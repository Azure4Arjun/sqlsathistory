## Title: Active Directory Content in a SQL Server Database
## Abstract:
### This session will describe an ETL-based approach to loading Active Directory (AD) content into a SQL Server DB.  This DB can then be used to provide program-based or interactive access to AD content using familiar SQL syntax without the complexity or limitations of using special AD tools or LDAP queries to directly access AD content.  AD content includes users, computers, groups, and group memberships.
