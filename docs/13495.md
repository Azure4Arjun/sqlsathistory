## Title: What The Tabular???
## Abstract:
### Knowing how to build a Tabular model is one thing. Knowing how to build a Tabular model the right way is something completely different. In this session we’ll discuss how to decide if building a Tabular model is the right choice, how to build a Tabular model completely from scratch, best practices you should follow, and things to avoid. If you’re new to Tabular Modeling or wanting to learn best practices, this session is for you!
