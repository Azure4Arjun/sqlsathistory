## Title: Lock, Block and Two Smoking Barrels - Inside SQL Server Concurrency
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a high performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform but due to its complexity, bad programming practices, poor indexing and configuration can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates and much more! In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. Now in SQL Server 2012 and SQL 2014 even more have followed including latch free data-structures, but many challenges and problems still remain. Letâ€™s take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate Pessimistic and Optimistic isolation understanding how they work, when you should use them, and more importantly when they can go very wrong. Don't be staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two Smoking Barrels and join me for this revealing and thought provoking presentation.
