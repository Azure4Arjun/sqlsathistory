## Title: Database Migration to Cloud with Zero Downtime
## Abstract:
### Cloud adoption for enterprise databases is in full swing.  Whether it is production databases supporting mission critical applications or for High availability or Disaster recovery, the Cloud is on nearly every enterprise roadmap. Organizations are presented with options when it comes to cloud platform vendors like Azure, AWS, Google, etc., but have business dependencies on high performance, tight security and near zero downtimes during and after migration. If you are planning on migrating your on-premises production database to the cloud, keeping test or development environments refreshed and in sync this session is for you.

-   Key trends driving cloud adoption
-   Top considerations for a DBA before moving databases to cloud
