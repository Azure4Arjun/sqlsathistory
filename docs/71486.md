## Title: Stream Analytics for a SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### As database developers, we are very familiar with patterns and practices of analyzing data at rest â€“ data that has been loaded into our databases and data warehouses and that allows us to learn what happened a few hours, days or months ago. Yet, we often encounter the need to know and respond to what is happening right now, which requires near-real-time analysis of data in motion.

Fortunately, much of the skillset that we have accumulated in querying data at rest can be applied in querying streaming data with the Azure Stream Analytics service. In this demo-rich session, you will learn the essential architecture and patterns of building streaming analytics solutions and will be introduced to the Stream Analytics Query Language.
