## Title: Resolving Cardinality Estimate Issues 
## Abstract:
### When the query optimizer inaccurately predicts the number of rows for query execution plan iterators, performance can suffer due the generation and use of a suboptimal plan.  Fixing cardinality estimate issues will help the query optimizer generate a higher quality plan. This session will teach you how to identify cardinality estimate issues in your query execution plan and also cover various ways in which cardinality estimate issues can be addressed.
