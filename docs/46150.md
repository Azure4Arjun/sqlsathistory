## Title: Life Balance - Sad Realities of Divorce, Optimizations and Being On Call
## Abstract:
### DBAs have a unique job profile that caters to work-life imbalance. How can our spouses expect to be first in our lives when they aren't? At your kid's play and the pager goes off? At Valentine's dinner date and your manager calls? Ever try sleeping through the night during a maintenance weekend? Every one of these is a common occurance that gets interrupted when you are a DBA with on-call duties and they have their consequences. If you are getting in to being a DBA, you need to know what that means to your life, and learn a few techniques to help keep you in balance and not be another burned out techie.
