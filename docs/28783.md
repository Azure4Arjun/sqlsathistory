## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server with SysInternals Tools
## Abstract:
### In this demo-packed session we will explore the use of SysInternals tools like Process Monitor, Process Explorer, and many others to troubleshoot various problem scenarios with SQL Server. This session is not for the faint of heart and is tailored toward those adventurous DBAs who often like to step out of their comfort zone. A fair knowledge of Windows OS internals is recommended.
