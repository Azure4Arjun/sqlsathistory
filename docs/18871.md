## Speaker: Ravi Kumar
## Title: Think like SSIS and Build a package
## Abstract:
### You wouldn't drive to a new place without directions? Then why build a SSIS package without having a road map on how to build it. Learn how to think like SSIS, make your ETL life easy, and convert a Process into an SSIS Package.  If time allows, we will also cover SSIS Package Configurations, security and deployment. Expect to participate actively in the class.
