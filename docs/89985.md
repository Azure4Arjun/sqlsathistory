## Title: Building Quality Web APIs with Asp.Net Core
## Abstract:
### We’ve all done “dotnet new webapi” and got our values from the ValuesController.  Now what do we do next?  In this talk we will discuss how to structure our project(s), create good api urls, handle versioning, unit test our api, and secure our endpoints.  There are plenty of examples of best practices for .Net Core Web APIs.  We will look at them and figure out why we would want to implement these practices.  We will also identify the benefits for doing so.
