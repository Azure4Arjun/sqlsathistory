## Title: Solving Problems with Extended Events.
## Abstract:
### Extended Events has been around since SQL 2008, but still on many systems I look into rarely have anything more than Systems Health or AlwaysOn running. This session will show how to use XE to prepare for upgrades, find problematic queries, as well as how to think differently about XE, not just as a tracing option, but as a solution builder. Also this session will touch on how to write Xquery in a simple format when needing to write queries against your XE sessions.
