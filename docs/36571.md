## Speaker: Ted Stathakis
## Title: Graphs, Charts, Gauges, Sparklines Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of the classic pick parameter/run report routine?  If you’re not I bet your users are.  Leverage Reporting Services (SSRS) to turn those same reports into an interactive “dashboard” where users simply click their way around the data.  Add some graphical splash to make you reports come alive.  In this session designed for people comfortable with SSRS looking to take their implementation to a new level we will go beyond charts and graphs and explore other representations of data.  You will see how utilizing dynamic action buttons in report headers combined with sub reports and drill through reports can significantly improve user interaction and analysis of the data.  Come see what you can do without a great deal of effort to take your SSRS solution to a new height.
