## Title: DevOps for Migratory Deployments
## Abstract:
### In an automated world, itâ€™s easy to feel like we are losing the tight control we used to have on some of our daily processes. Other processes have remained manual out of fear of losing that same control. What if there was a way to keep the control and automate the process at the same time? In this session, I go over my experiences with different ways of managing schema changes over the life of a project and explore a controlled and automated approach.
