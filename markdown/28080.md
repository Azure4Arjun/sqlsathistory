## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data
## Abstract:
### SSRS 2008 and above provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many features, such as server aggregation, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.
