## Title: Data Governance and Master Data Management
## Abstract:
### With system implementation and data sourcing being more widely distributed than ever, from on premise to cloud and cloud services to self-service BI, challenges to manage your enterprise data has only grown exponentially harder.  We will review options and scenarios for implementing Master Data Management (MDM), and discuss how a Data Governance framework to support the entire process becomes very critical to the success of your business.  We will look at design patterns available to support your MDM effort, tools, such as SQL Server Master Data Services, and the setup of the organization oversight as an integral part of the overall picture.
