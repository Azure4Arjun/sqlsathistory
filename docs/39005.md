## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. Forexample, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed. 

This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.
