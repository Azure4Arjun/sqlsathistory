## Title: Introduction to U-SQL and Data Lake
## Abstract:
### U-SQL is the new kid on the SQL language block. In this session we'll look at the what, where, why and how of the language. Is it a query language? Is it a data transformation language? Will it replace T-SQL? Should you learn it? Where is it? What is Data Lake? We'll discuss all this and more.
