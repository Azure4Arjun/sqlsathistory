## Title: Predictive Analysis with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
## Abstract:
### R/Python are the leading languages in Data Science and statistics.

In this session we will talk how you can use SQL Server Machine Learning Services (SQL Server R Services in SQL Server 2016), which gives the ability to run R/Python scripts in SQL Server. Avoid unnecessary data movements and execute scripts in-database without moving data outside SQL Server or over the network.

This session will show how Microsoft SQL Server can help meet an increasingly “predictive” world by supporting the R/Python language inside the database.

Demonstration of using R and SQL Server Machine Learning Services.
