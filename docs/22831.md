## Title: ETL for the masses with Power Query and "M"
## Abstract:
### Power Query allows users to incorporate public data and organizational data seamlessly in Excel. The purpose of this session is to take a deeper dive into the capabilities of Power Query and of the "M" language.
The more I use Power Query and the M language that underpins it, the more I see how useful it is – quite apart from its abilities to import data from other data sources – as a third option to solve problems in Excel itself. Furthermore it provides a simple interface over the data transformation engine (powered by M), and it has become a tool of choice anytime I need to get data into Excel. 
In this demo-driven session I will show how you can use Power Query to do some initial data shaping, visualize, and then automate the data loading process through SSIS.
