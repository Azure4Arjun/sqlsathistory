## Title: Azure Data Warehousing made easy with Biml 
## Abstract:
### During a recent project migrating from on premise to the cloud. First we were going to Redshift and started coding, then were asked to use Azure DWH instead. We soon realized that moving between cloud providers was actually quite similar, just different names and slightly different code format.

In this session we will investigate several options to migrate your existing solution and the "fastest" way to get your data into the cloud including:
 1) Reusable data export templates
2) Transferring files to Azure Blob Storage
3) Polybase to load data
4) CTAS to Merge data

Can Biml also do AWS S3 and Redshift? Yes and we will show you the similarities in approaches and how we are using it at one of our customers.
