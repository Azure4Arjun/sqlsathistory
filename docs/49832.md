## Title: Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?
## Abstract:
### Could your seemingly-normal SSIS package be hiding a disaster, waiting to detonate at the most inconvenient time? Integration Services is an incredibly flexible product, and that flexibility can lead to good - and occasionally bad - design patterns. Small and seemingly trivial design decisions can lead to big issues down the road, including leaky data flows, data quality issues, paralyzing performance issues, and other explosive behaviors.

In this session, we will explore some of the most common SSIS design patterns that are potentially more harmful than they first appear. From package configuration to control flow constraints, and data flow transformations to logging, we'll demonstrate what can go wrong and show some alternative designs to prevent these types of problems from developing into bigger issues.
