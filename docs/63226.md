## Title: SQL Server 2016 Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### Data does not become information until decision makers are able to view it and make those decisions that affect the enterprise as a whole. Stored procedures are one means of getting the data from the database tables to the reports in an effective and efficient manner.
In this hands-on presentation, we shall be looking at best practices with regards to creating and tuning stored procedures. We shall also be discussing parameter sniffing and other gotchaâ€™s that affect us in our daily lives.
