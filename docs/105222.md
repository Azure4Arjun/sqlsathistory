## Title: Database Reliability Engineer - the new DBA?
## Abstract:
### Database technology has been evolving for years now - rather than being just SQL Server we now talk about managing a data platform.

The skillset of the DBA needs to rapidly change/evolve and they need to be generalists who are familiar with different platforms and the ability to recommend the right fit for an application. Whilst still being specialised enough to support a database to meet business application requirements.

Database Reliability Engineering teams configure, manage and support database infrastructure, writing the automation that builds databases to scale to serve hundreds of thousands of queries per second.

They embrace automation, they understand and leverage cloud services and using DevOps is how they approach all aspects of database installation, configuration and management.

This session will introduce the Database Reliability Engineer which is the new DBA.
