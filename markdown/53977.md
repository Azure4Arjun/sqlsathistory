## Title: Getting started with Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### As data warehouses continue to see rapid expansions of data, traditional architectures struggle to keep up. Massively Parallel Processing is a technique that allows a data warehouse to be seamlessly distributed across multiple machines allowing for near linear scaling. Massively Parallel processing was first introduced to SQL through Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) which was a large and often expensive deployment process. Azure SQL Data Warehouse brings much of the Power of Parallel Data Warehouse but with many advantages of the cloud such as lower costs and faster deployment.
In this session we will look at how the Azure SQL Data Warehouse works behind the scenes. We will also look at various options for provisioning and loading data before ending with a look at how queries executed.
