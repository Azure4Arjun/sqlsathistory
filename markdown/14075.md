## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: DB1: Let's Talk Internals
## Abstract:
### Performance tuning is both an art and a science. The more science you bring to your efforts, the better your art will be.
There are many tools and techniques for finding performance problems, but solving them is usually left to the person using those techniques. This extended session focuses on what’s going on under SQL Server’s hood for a set of tasks normally hidden from users, such as: memory allocation, data manipulation, and on-disk and in-memory data structures. Armed with this knowledge, you will be better prepared to solve a variety of performance problems through deeper insight into the processes working behind the scenes.
