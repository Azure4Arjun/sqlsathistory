## Title: Azure SQL and Automation, how to keep your database up-to-speed in the cloud
## Abstract:
### While the typical DBA role is being assigned to mission-critical databases, we developers, still need to plan for some basic database maintenance. 
During this session, we will review the typical maintenance activities that need to be taken in Azure SQL and how to make sure they execute on a regular basis, without a higher cost and with low supervision effort. Several demos will also be reviewed to show the usage and potential of these techniques.
