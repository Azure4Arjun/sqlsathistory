## Title: Dimensional Modelling for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered what's going on with that SQL Server Analysis server you support? Do you want to know what this
BI fuss is all about?  I'll walk you through the basics of dimensional modelling to help you understand from a operational
DBA perspective what's going on and why a BI system needs to be treated differently. I'll take the mysticism out of the 
differences between OLTP and OLAP and provide a method to the maddness.
