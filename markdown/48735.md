## Title: Skills Needed to Transition From DBA to BI Architect
## Abstract:
### Dimensional Modeling is a re-tooling of your existing database normalization knowledge. T-SQL and coding knowledge can transfer to ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) using Integration Services (SSIS). Report Writing has been around for decades and learning Analysis Services (SSAS) can save days of work that custom report writing has taken teams.

Development today requires the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) output. My personal transition from Sr. DBA to DW Architect has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end results analytically. These lessons have molded me into a DW Architect.
