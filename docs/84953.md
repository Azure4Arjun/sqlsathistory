## Title: Hyper-Interactivity in Power BI and SSRS Reports
## Abstract:
### Power BI and SQL Server Reporting Services both provide numerous features to enabling data interactivity. This session combines the more advanced interactive features to demonstrate a truly dynamic report viewing experience. Together we will explore the use of custom visualizations, bookmarks, advanced DAX and more, to dynamically change chart axes and even visualization measures with a selection from a slicer. We will even see how to completely change the presentation on a Power BI tab with the single click of a button. Come see how to take your reports from interactive to hyper-interactivity.
