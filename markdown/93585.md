## Title: Performance tuning for SQL Server memory grants
## Abstract:
### When you're performance tuning queries that request memory grants, you want to know where, how and why the memory is granted and used in your query.

In this session, we'll cover query memory grants through examples. We'll also demonstrate the problems that memory grants can cause, and a variety of solutions to use when performance tuning.
