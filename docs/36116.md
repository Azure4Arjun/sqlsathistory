## Title: Silent Performance Killers Lurking in Your Code
## Abstract:
### Design patterns that work well in traditional application development often mutate into anti-patterns and blunder, unwittingly, into stored procedures and other database objects. Modularized code for code reuse which can impact execution plans, looping through all rows to get aggregated data, and working in a “top down” fashion instead of leveraging sub-queries  are just a few of these anti-patterns. We’ll take a look at better ways to address the issues these anti-patterns bring into your code, ways that are more efficient in SQL Server. We'll talk about the correct use of user-defined functions. We'll see how to leverage t-SQL windows functions can provide aggregated in an efficient set based manner.  By moving away from these poor programming patterns, you can gain better performance from your database.
