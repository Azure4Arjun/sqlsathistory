## Title: Getting started with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Integration services is a powerful tool for visualizing and handling most of your SQL Server ETL needs. But Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) can be a confusing tool the first time that you start the application. There's a LOT going on, and for the first time developer, it's not very clear how to get started. This session will help get you on your feet developing SSIS packages. We will look at some common scenarios and live demo creating your first SSIS packages to copy data from one server to another, extract data to a flat file, and learn how to solve some common errors. Feel free to bring your questions on getting started with BIDS.
