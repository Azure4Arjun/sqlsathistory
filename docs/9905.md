## Speaker: Anthony Sammartino
## Title: A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover how PowerPivot and BISM Tabular complement each other in the domains of self-service and corporate BI. Let's face it, The Finance department does not have the expertise to model a database for reporting, and IT doesn't have the expertise in advanced financial calculations that the executive team is interested in. To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.
