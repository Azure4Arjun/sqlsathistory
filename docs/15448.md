## Title: Boost your T-SQL with the APPLY Operator
## Abstract:
### The APPLY operator is available in T-SQL for quite some time now, but for many people it’s under the radar. People who do know it can’t stop using it, and this session will show you why. The session starts with a brief overview of the operator and its fundamental optimization aspects. Then the session demonstrates some of its more creative uses.
