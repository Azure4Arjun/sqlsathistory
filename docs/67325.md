## Abstract:
### Cloud and Data are big buzzwords these days, but how can you make the work for you?  There are so many great articles out there telling you how great the cloud and data are, but now you can experience it first hand!  In this pre-con you will gain hands on experience with various data technologies in Azure and how they can come together to create a practical data solution.  Technologies will include Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, and Power BI.  You will go through steps to provision an environment, extract, load, transform and gain insight from the data.  You will also see how AI can be connected into this solution with minimal effort.
