## Title: SQL server window functions
## Abstract:
### All database users know about regular aggregate functions which operate on an entire table and are used with a GROUP BY clause. But few people use Window functions in SQL. These operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row.

The main advantage of using Window functions over regular aggregate functions is: Window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row, the rows retain their separate identities and an aggregated value will be added to each row.

In this session I will walk through the syntax of window functions as well as demonstrate common use cases for where window functions.
