## Title: A Gentle Introduction To Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Machine Learning is certainly a hot topic these days.  For example, Microsoft is all-in in its company transformation from "a PC on every desktop" to "deep learning in every software".  There are tons of product offerings in and out of the Microsoft stack and cloud and it can be a bit daunting to separate all of the noise from the signal.  In this session, we are going to look at the fundamentals of machine learning - the building blocks of Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Apps.

Some familiarity of computing programming, statistics, and manipulating tabular data will help you get the most out of this session.
