#  Database design with performance in mind
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-40)
Event Date: 31-07-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA2
## Speaker: Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title:  Database design with performance in mind
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest benefits of SQL Server is simplicity. Developer creates a database, write a few T-SQL statements and everything is up and running.. until the system grows up and starts to introduce performance problems. And infinite loop begins: Refactor -> Deploy -> Refactor -> Deploy ->.. In a few years developer has gray hairs and ton of experience. 

The purpose of this session is sharing this experience helping to avoid some of the typical issues for the systems working under heavy load. The session gives the overview of how SQL Server stores data, what criteria Query Optimizer uses choosing the index, how data is locking - essential knowledge when you expect system to handle thousands transactions per second.

## Speaker: Jose Chinchilla
## Title: Change Data Capture a tool for BI,DR,Audit  more
## Abstract:
### Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available for SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore.

On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, Debugging, Documentation and more.

## Title: SQL Server Memory Deep Dive 
## Abstract:
### Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server. RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.

# Creating a C# Runtime Dynamic SSIS Designer

## Speaker: Sam Abraham
## Title: Creating a C# Runtime Dynamic SSIS Designer
## Abstract:
### SSIS enables us to quickly create deployable packages to move/manipulate data. Things do however get a bit challenging when source and destination tables are not known at package design time or when a requirement exists to have an already-deployed package support schema changes in source tables. One solution to this problem is to leverage our ability to create and execute an SSIS package dynamically in code.

In this session we will take a look at a complete project for a C# Runtime SSIS Package Designer, taking as input a set of table names and dynamically generating both destination Access tables then creating, validating, saving and executing an SSIS Package at runtime with logging enabled to demonstrate the various package steps.
