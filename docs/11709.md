## Speaker: Carmel Gunn
## Title: The European Economic Crisis and the Euro-A Data Tale
## Abstract:
### Investigative exploration of data is very often ad-hoc in nature. We might need to interact with many types and soures of data. The Questions we need to ask, and the data we might need to answer them are not set in stone, and as a result following traditional modelling is not always an option. Rather, we follow the data, to an unknown end.

In this session, we take the European Economic Crisis, and the Euro, and see what publically available data can do to give us insights into one of the largest currencies in the world.
