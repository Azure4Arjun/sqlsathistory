IDC research, commissioned by Microsoft, shows that better outcomes from data and analytics projects correlate with greater competitiveness of an organization in its industry or a better ability to fulfil its mission in the public sector. Although correlation does not equate to causation, a growing body of research shows financial and productivity benefits directly linked to better data-driven decision making enabled by business analytics solutions.

Four characteristics distinguish leaders in analytics—the use of more diverse data types and sources beyond social media to include the Internet of Things (IoT), adoption of more diverse analytical and self-service tools, methods, and metrics suited to broad range of users from data scientists to business analysts and executives, distribution of insights to a more diverse audience of business users, and the right-time application of most timely data.
