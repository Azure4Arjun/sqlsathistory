## Title: Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### One of the new features of SQL Server 2012 is columnstore indexes, where the storage of index data is “turned on its head”. We will look into how this feature is implemented internally, how it can greatly improve query performance in the right environment, what the current limitations are, and how to implement workarounds for those limitations.
