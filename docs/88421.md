## Speaker: Trey Johnson
## Title: Ensuring Analytics Hit the Mark  (and Get Used!)
## Abstract:
### Dashboards, Reports, Charts and all ways to structure data for analysis is failing! Sound familiar? If so, the adoption dilemma is present and needs to be solved.
If users would rather get data dumped to them, rather than work with what they’ve been given, this session is for you!
We’ll give you techniques to solve the adoption dilemma and make analytics the hero of your organization without having to endure the pain of further purchasing, added frustration or the ongoing angst for something your organization simply does not have.
This session will talk to the culture of analytics and the ways you might marry the best work of those who prepare the data (often IT) with the work those should be doing to explore the data (everyone else)!
