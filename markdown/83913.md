## Title: Modernize your database environment with SQL Database Managed Instance
## Abstract:
### Are you interested in moving to the cloud? Do you want to close your data center? Is your current hosting solution giving you high maintenance? You’re asked to do more with less or do you want to expand your reach globally? A lot of questions where Microsoft can provide you the perfect answer! You will be able to lift and shift, at scale, your on-premises SQL Servers with the fully-automated Database Migration Service to a Managed Instance that is highly compatible with SQL Server. This means you can continue to use the tools and features you're familiar with and not have to worry about re-architecting your apps or high maintenance. In this session, we will cover what features Managed Instance brings to SQL Database. After completing the session, you will understand what SQL Database Managed Instance is, how it’s different from an existing SQL Database offering and how you can use it to speed up and simplify your journey to the cloud.
