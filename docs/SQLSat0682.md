# Purging data in SQL 2016 using Dynamic Partitioning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#682-Minnesota-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 17:05:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Kirby Richter
## Title: Purging data in SQL 2016 using Dynamic Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing table partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We use a controller table so it's easy to change settings and set it up to keep a fixed number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle through the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be extended for archiving but in this example we are using it to implement a data retention scheme.  We look at new features in SQL 2014 such as managed lock priority and truncating partitions in SQL 2016.  Assumes you have some understanding of SQL Server table partitioning and T-SQL coding.

# SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#682-Minnesota-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 17:05:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
## Abstract:
### We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

# DB Options on Azure – Which One Should I Use?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#682-Minnesota-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 17:05:00 - Track: Cloud
## Speaker: Tim Plas
## Title: DB Options on Azure – Which One Should I Use?
## Abstract:
### So many ways to handle database information on Azure: Table Storage, NoSQL, CosmosDB, SQL as VM’s, multiple flavors of SQL-as-a-service, open-source SQL-as-a-service, data lake, Azure Data Warehouse, etc. How and why should I choose one (or a particular combination) over the others? What’s so special about each one?

# Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#682-Minnesota-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 17:05:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance
## Abstract:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

# Getting Started with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#682-Minnesota-2017)
Event Date: 07-10-2017 - Session time: 17:05:00 - Track: Administration
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

## Speaker: Kevin Hill
## Title: Backups for new/non-DBAs...the Why, not the How
## Abstract:
### Join me and get some new perspective on what your DBA is doing, and why!

Targeted at the non-DBA such as BI/DW folks, Application Developers, Managers, and System Admins, this session will go over the reasons we back up our databases, our systems, etc.  Considerations such as Single points of failure, High Availability/Disaster recovery, Business Continuity and others will be discussed in this interactive conversation.   It will be conversation heavy, with supporting slides to download, and one Database backup demo at the end if time permits.

Everyone involved in a technical role needs to at least know that the things they have created will be recoverable in the event of a disaster, or even just an "oops" moment.   The CIO/CTO should know how long critical systems will be down when bad things happen.  Backups are everyone's responsibility...whether asking the right questions or implementing the process.

## Speaker: Nem Schlecht
## Title: Automated Enterprise-wide SQL Server Auditing
## Abstract:
### Do you have many SQL instances in your enterprise?  Do you have to maintain multiple dev/test/uat/pre-prod/prod environments?  Need to spin up new instances often?  Do you need a way to ensure these environments are all set up correctly and consistently and be notified of changes to them?  If so, you need an enterprise-wide auditing system!  I will be presenting my free, open source, system that does the following: 1) Collects information an all of your SQL instances daily, 2) sends you a report of any changes that have occurred (new/old/changed values), 3) lets you set up rules for all/some of servers and checks these rules on a daily basis (ie - backup compression should be turned on, Max memory should be less than 2TB, etc) and will even send you the SQL to fix any rules that failed.

## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: SQL Server Hybrid Cloud Strategy: Best Of Both Worlds With On-Prem  Cloud
## Abstract:
### For years it seemed that the only message SQL Server professionals were hearing was "to the Cloud.... you must get to the Cloud!". However, if you work in a highly regulated industry, or one simply averse to change, this likely was not an option for you. The good news is, Microsoft heard your feedback and has been busy incorporating Cloud connectivity, compatibility, and functionality into the box product.

Come spend the hour with me and you’ll learn how to leverage the power of the Cloud with your on-premises SQL Server install. We’ll cover backup and restore options with Windows Azure Storage, using Windows Azure VMs for high availability, how to store your data files in Windows Azure Storage, and more.  We’ll start with SQL Server 2012 and work our way up to the most recently released bits for SQL Server 2016.  You can have the best of both worlds with a SQL Server Hybrid Cloud strategy!

## Title: Navigating Modern BI - Infrastructure in 2017
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence has sat pretty comfortably on the same laurels for well over a decade however that landscape has been disrupted by the surfacing new Azure tools, Power BI, and now Power BI on premise. With so many new tools and features things can get pretty intimidating, especially for those with additional considerations and regulations. It can however open new doors to organizations who were previously unable to fully utilize BI. Through presentation, demo, and open discussion we attempt to navigate classic BI Architecture and the available options there in, as well as touch upon the future of BI with Big Data tools as they continue to develop.
