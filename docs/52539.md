## Title: Indexes: The neglected performance all-rounder
## Abstract:
### Proper indexing is a very time and cost-effective way to improve SQL performance. Yet it is hardly known how to get it right and how different ways to phrase a query affects indexing and performance. In this session Iâ€™ll explain why this knowledge is sparse and what developers can do about it. Finally we will go through the most important indexing mistakes by example and discuss them during a short live quiz with the audience.
