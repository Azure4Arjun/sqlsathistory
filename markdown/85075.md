## Title: Becoming a hipster DBA, a guide to Github and CI/CD for Admins [EN]
## Abstract:
### The use of securing your code in source control and testing it automatically with a continuous integration tool is not something developers need to be convinced of. But DBAs have traditionally not used any of these techniques. It's also not that straight forward for them. Checking the outcome of a typical DBA script usually involves the need for infrastructure to be available in a certain state and tests that check the changes made to that infrastructure. This session will combine an introduction level talk about Git(hub) and Continuous Integration with the complexity of Infrastructure testing aimed ad DBAs.
