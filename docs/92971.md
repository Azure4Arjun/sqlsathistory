## Title: Temporal Tables - Managing Large Data Sets and Their Effects on Performance
## Abstract:
### So, you installed SQL 2016 (or newer) and implemented Temporal Tables for some of your data.  Everything is running well, but now what?  In this session we will look at the effects of adding various indexes to both the main and the history table and discuss what that might mean to the front end performance.  We will go into data management scenarios, for when you do not want to keep all the data in that table forever.
