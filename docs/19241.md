## Title: Let's Get It Started - SQL Server installation and configuration
## Abstract:
### We've all installed SQL Server and, most of the times, the default settings work just fine.  This is a beginner session that will help you to understand what those settings mean along with why there might be times that you want to use something other than the defaults and how that might impact your server.  We'll also talk about unattended installs, both with and without a config file.  This can really help to standardize your SQL Server installations and save you some precious keystrokes.
