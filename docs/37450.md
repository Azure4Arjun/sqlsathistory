## Title: Scratching the surface: An overview of SSRS and building your first BI Report
## Abstract:
### Reports are the first place managers and business leaders look for the information they need to make decisions and run a business.  SQL Server Reporting Services is a mature product that enables reporting within the Microsoft SQL Stack. This session will act as an introduction to SSRS, its infrastructure, and the basics of report design.  There will be a brief overview of the development environment, wizards, datasets, grouping, subscriptions, permissions and some basic graphing alongside the data.
