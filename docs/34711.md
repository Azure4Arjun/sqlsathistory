## Speaker: Leo Furlong
## Title: It's a hard Ops life!
## Abstract:
### MDM isn't just about technology implementation, but about going through the real pain, trials, and tribulations of addressing core issues the company has in the areas of Organization, Process, Data Management/Data Governance, and Technology.

Join John Head and Leo Furlong as they discuss the process of trying to discover a companyâ€™s operational MDM issues, set up a program for addressing the real problems, and trying to make real organization change to not only clean up the data, but prevent it from getting dirty in the first place.
