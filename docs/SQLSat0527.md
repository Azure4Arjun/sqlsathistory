# Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#527---Columbus-2016)
Event Date: 16-07-2016 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration, Architecture  Deployment
## Speaker: Colleen Morrow
## Title: Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Service Broker is often seen as a black box. Messages go in, and hopefully they come out on the other side.  But when they don't, DBAs typically don’t know where to look. Trying to figure out what’s wrong quickly turns into a guessing game.
It’s not that complicated once you understand how it all works. 
Service Broker is an asynchronous messaging technology built into SQL Server that allows you to scale out your application, replicate data or perform ETL, all while guaranteeing messages are delivered and processed in the right order.   In this session, we'll discuss the basics of the Service Broker architecture, its components, and deployment options.  We will discuss troubleshooting tips and performance best practices to help you deploy a Service Broker solution in your own environment.

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Get Near Realtime ETL with Service Broker
## Abstract:
### Most of the time you’ll see ETL being done with a tool such as SSIS, but what if you need near-realtime reporting? You need to get the updates in your OLTP database to the Data Warehouse quickly, but with minimal impact on your application. Asynchronous messaging with Service Broker makes this simple and painless. This session will walk through the basic transformations to build a Kimbal-style data warehouse from an OLTP database and demonstrate how to keep your data warehouse updated using Service Broker messages from your OLTP database.

Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods

## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework
## Abstract:
### Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, and SSIS packages that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Title: Getting to know U-SQL
## Abstract:
### With so many languages around to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize data, Microsoft introduced yet another language : U-SQL.  In this session, we'll take a look at what U-SQL is, what it brings to the table, and how it differs from (or overlaps with) the existing constructs (T-SQL, SQL CLR, DAX/MDX, PowerQuery/M, R etc.,).  We'll go over step-by-step in getting started with U-SQL, and review some use case scenarios.
