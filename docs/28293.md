# SQLSaturday #149 - Minnesota 2012
Event Date: 29-09-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Rapson 56
## Speaker: Zach Mattson
## Title: A Powershell Driven Life
## Abstract:
### Why am I here?  This is a question you might ask yourself each day at work.  Perhaps its mundane tasks, reactive troubleshooting, or just filling out TPS reports on a Friday afternoon.  This session is going to attack the mundane and show you some of the things Powershell can bring to the table for working with SQL Server.  From performance monitoring to writing tests, it promises to be entirely scripts and demos compiled from real work on a large OLTP SQL environment .  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.       

No SSIS or Powerpoint will be harmed during this presentation.
