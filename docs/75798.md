## Title: Data Positioning: Self-Defense or a Brilliant New Architecture
## Abstract:
### The Cloud, streaming data, big data, self-service, machine learning, AI and the internet of things.  Clearly weâ€™re not in Data Management Kansas anymore.  Data Modelers and Architects have been reacting to wave after wave of demands from these communities with new technologies and methodologies but too often remain grounded in outdated concepts of data management principles.  Data Positioning is an evolution of this thinking, allowing Data Managers to deliver value today and in the future.
