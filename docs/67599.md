## Speaker: Elizabeth Noble
## Title: Introduction to unit and integration testing with tSQLt
## Abstract:
### Testing allows database code to be consistently verified during the development process, but it can be challenging to get testing setup for database development. This session will give an overview on the purpose of database testing, the installation of the tSQLt framework, and the design of unit and integration tests. I will use general concepts of test driven design to create and run tests to confirm that objects exist and to test single and multiple test cases. Learn how to implement testing in a development environment and create and run your own tests.
