## Abstract:
### Managing and Gaining Insight in Unstructured Data with SQL Server 2012: FileTable and Semantic Search

Learn how SQL Server 2012 is reshaping FILESTREAM functionality to enable non-transactional access to Win32 Applications and while at the same time allowing you to manipulate it equally well through SQL relational algebra with a new exciting feature called 'FileTable'. Coupled together with another exciting new feature 'Statistical Semantic Search' that allows you to extract statistically relevant phrases as potential tag recommendations, or find potentially similar content based upon these phrases, SQL Server 2012 now provides unique advances in how unstructured data can be managed and mined using database technologies.
