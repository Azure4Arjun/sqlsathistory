## Title: Writing Your First BimlScript
## Abstract:
### Everyone is talking about the advantages of Biml, but how do you get started? In this highly interactive presentation, I’ll guide you through the process of creating your first BimlScript. During the process we’ll cover the basics of Biml syntax, language options for generating BimlScript, recommended methods of storing and using metadata, and a lot more. As an added bonus, you’ll leave the presentation with BimlScripts you can adapt to use in your own environments using tools that you already have.
