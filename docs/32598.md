## Title: Must-Know Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Design patterns are recurring solutions to software design problems you find again and again in application development. They also serve as a vocabulary for developers to communicate their ideas. 

Come and walk-through 5 key patterns, with easy-to-follow examples, and a clear explanation of the how and why behind each:

•	Factory
•	Strategy
•	Observer
•	Template Method
•	Decorator

You’ll walk away with an understanding of each pattern which you can take to the office the next day and implement
