## Title: Automating Deployments with Powershell
## Abstract:
### Some aspects of SQL Server installations are easily repeatable using things like config files and command line installs.    However, so much of the preparation and post-install configuration still needs to be done manually.

This session will show how Powershell can be used to prep the servers (including how easy it can be to deploy a cluster) and how Powershell can then be used to deploy and configure SQL Server according to your company standards.
