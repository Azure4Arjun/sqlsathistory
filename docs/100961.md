## Speaker: Bob Ward
## Title: SQL Server By Example
## Abstract:
### Sometimes there is no better way than to learn by example. In this session, you will learn key capabilities of SQL Server and Azure SQL by seeing demonstrations. This session is all about less slides and more demos! This session will show you demonstrations on topics such as containers, Kubernetes, performance, availability, and data virtualization. You will walk away with all the resources you need to try out everything you see on your own time.
