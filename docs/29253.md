## Title: Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale
## Abstract:
### It happens to everyone. One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow, steady rate. Then next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load. Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives. In this session, we will examine best practices to apply to reporting databases that grow to become much larger than expected.  We will examine a real-world scenario and discuss the strategies and techniques implemented in order to get the database back on track.
