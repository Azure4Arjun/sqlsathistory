## Title: Remember Back When?  Temporal Tables in SQL Server 2016 and 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 and later come with their own version of a Wayback Machine: temporal tables.  With this new feature, it is easy to store and query the history of changes to data.  We will discuss the fundamentals and creating, storing data in, querying from, and maintaining these tables. We will also take a quick look under the hood to see how they work, and we'll also consider the current limitations that are in place.  Find out how temporal tables can benefit your system!
