## Title: Azure Data Studio – Way Cool for Database Applications
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Studio (ADS) cross-platform database development tool which runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. ‘ADS’ supports SQL Server and Postgres (with more DB platforms soon) and works both on-prem and in the cloud. ADS is highly extensible, open source, and can dramatically change the way you work with databases.

In this session, we will provide a case study on how Azure Data Studio can directly integrate with an existing ELT/ETL database application. Topics include:
 - ADS Snippet and Extension Capabilities
 - ADS Terminal Window
 - ADS Platform Integrations
 - ADS Application Reporting
And why Azure Data Studio could be Way Cool for your Database Application
