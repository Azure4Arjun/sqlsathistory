## Speaker: Joe Homnick
## Title: Blockchain - A Database Architecture Paradigm Shift
## Abstract:
### Joe takes you on an easy to understand journey of Blockchain technology. Blockchain is the basis of Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin etc., however, extends way beyond these as a framework for Smart Contracts.

To better understand developer Blockchain opportunities, Joe deploys an Ethereum simulated multi-member network in Azure, consisting of a set of load-balanced transaction nodes with which an application or user can interact to submit transactions and a set of mining nodes to record transactions.

Joe will also investigate new toolsets coming out to assist in Blockchain Development including CoCo Framework, App Builder and Enterprise Smart Contracts.
