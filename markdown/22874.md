## Title: Battle of the Finch Bots
## Abstract:
### Robots, SQL, Twitter and games!  In an ongoing battle across SQL Saturdays, our two Finch bots DAX (represents developers) and DEX (represents DBAs) will compete against each other. You the audience will help determine the winner of the finch bot race by voting real time on twitter for your favorite robot. Challenge your fellow DBA or Developer to a game a laser tag.  After all games are over we will use SSIS to pull the twitter data collected by the finch bots and using my favorite BI tools analyze which robot is the winner
