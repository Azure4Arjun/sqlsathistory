## Title: Partitioning System for "WORM" Tables - Part 2 - Deep Dive on the Code
## Abstract:
### This isn't your typical talk on "partitioning".  This is a deep dive on the code for the problems and desired results for partitioning things like the "Audit" Table covered in Part 1.  It's strongly recommended that you attend Part 1 where the groundwork for this session has been laid out.  In this session, we'll build a 4 million-row test table and do the initial partitioning.  We'll follow that up with the monthly process to re-index and compress the latest full partition automatically every month and do a deep dive on a view that makes monitoring partitions easy.  This code helped me reduce backups to 1/60th the amount of time that they used to take.  There's a ton of ancillary learning in the code, as well.  Don't let the "advanced" rating of this session scare you away because it's written for all levels to understand.
