## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: How the Query Optimizer Works
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer is the component of SQL Server that attempts to determine the best way to execute a query by finding an efficient execution plan. This session will show you how a better understanding on how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your databases. See how you can provide SQL Server with appropriate statistics and indexes so it can perform better cardinality estimation and produce an efficient execution plan. Learn how you can troubleshoot problems if you are not getting an efficient execution plan and how you can use other alternatives like hints or plan guides to help the query optimizer to produce a better plan.

## Speaker: Chris Dickey
## Title: Fixing performance problems - Stuff happens
## Abstract:
### I will discuss tricky tuning issues that I have encountered during my years speeding up SQL Server. Simple rules often don't apply to complex problems. SQL Server queries can have a wide variety of complexities.
Slow queries are caused by these issues: 1. data might be retrieved from disk or RAM 2. row estimates are too high or too low 3. functions are zero costed 4. the optimizer doesn't know the value of a local variable 5. a query is too complex for the optimizer to do a great job 6. indexes compete for RAM 7. optional parameters 8. a high cost query only using 1 cpu 9. table variables  10. the optimizer isn't perfect

# SQL Design Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#44---Huntington-Beach-2010)
Event Date: 24-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jim Bears
## Title: SQL Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Patterns emerge as both templated solutions to recurring problems and designs, as well as provide useful ways to encapsulate complex ideas into smaller, friendlier terms. Patterns gained popularity in the object-orientated community since the Fowler and the Gang Of Four, but declarative languages, like SQL, have had little-to-no coverage of how these patterns can be applied.

Understanding SQL design patterns is a crucial skill every SQL developer must learn and use in their career. SQL patterns can be applied to small projects or large, multi-million dollar systems, to provide common solutions to complex problems.

Patterns create a foundation for "best practices" for SQL, Database Architecture, managers.

## Title: Is Virtualization is a good choice for SQL Server?
## Abstract:
### We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.
