## Title: Bringing AI to the edge: On-premise Azure Cognitive Services using containers
## Abstract:
### Azure Cognitive Services allow developers to build powerful AI-based solutions, enabling different capabilities in our software: vision. speech, search, text analytics, language understanding, and much more. Basically, the model is already built by Microsoft, you just need to do an API call to the Azure cloud and the service retrieves a result. For instance, you send a message and the Text Analytics API returns its sentiment score.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a local, non-cloud AI solution (either because of limited Internet access or data compliance). This is now possible thanks to the latest update of Azure Cognitive Services, which offers containerization support. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to configure and use containers in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be showcased as well for local Face and Text Cognitive Services.
