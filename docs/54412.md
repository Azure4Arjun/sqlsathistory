## Speaker: George Govantes
## Title: Agile Leadership Skills and Building High Performing Teams
## Abstract:
### How do you build an environment that inspires innovation and individual ownership to deliver  operational excellence? How to move away from the Command and Control leadership style that is so pervasive within the IT culture? How do you move from Manager to Leader?  In today’s modern Enterprise, attracting and keeping talented employees is a challenge.  We’ll cover the importance of: Spirit of Service, Project Vision, Allowing Team Input, and Trust in Team Members, and the impact these areas make on both Individual and Team performance.  Thus altering how the organization is Managed/Lead from:  “How do I accomplish corporate goals?” to the more empowering:  “How do WE accomplish our corporate goals?”.
