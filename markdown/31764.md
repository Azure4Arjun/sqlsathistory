## Title: Introduction to Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Microsoftâ€™s SQL Server Analysis Services is best known for its ability to build and manage OLAP data cubes.  In addition to that core functionality, SSAS enables users to define key performance indicators (KPIs), profile data, mine data and predict future activities using the results of that mining.  Perhaps best of all, SSAS is included as part of SQL Server 2008 Standard and Enterprise Editions.  This session introduces the audience to the capabilities of SSAS, businesses uses for those tools and ways to integrate SSAS with Integration Services and Reporting Services.
