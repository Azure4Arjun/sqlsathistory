## Title: Moving Data with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory - ADF - is a cloud data engineering solution. ADF version 2 sports a snappy web GUI (graphical user interface) and supports the SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) - or "SSIS in the Cloud."

Attend this session to learn: 
 - How to build a "native ADF" pipeline;
 - How to lift and shift SSIS to the Azure Data Factory integration Runtime; and
 - ADF Design Patterns to execute and monitor pipelines and packages.
