## Title: SQL Server Window functions â€“ reducing the need for cursors and other horrible stuff
## Abstract:
### Window functions have been part of SQL Server since 2005.  In 2012, we got some new additions that make performing aggregations, running counts, n-1 / n+1, and much more that could previously only be done with RBAR loops.

This developer focused session describes and details usage of these features, covering theoretical and real world scenarios.
