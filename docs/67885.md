## Speaker: Christopher Adkin
## Title: The All Flash DBA
## Abstract:
### We are at a major turning point in the world of storage; the transition from spinning disk to flash and as we move into this new world a lot of conventional wisdom will be turned on its head. Things such as the use of compression, putting different database components on different volumes, the desire to chase large readaheads for sequential scan workloads, how well mixed workloads are handled, the multi threaded log writer and delayed durability, besides this, the session will also cover nand flash fundamentals at 300 level.
