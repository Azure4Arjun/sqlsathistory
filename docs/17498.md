## Title: Unit Testing your SQL Server database with SSDT
## Abstract:
### Creating automated unit tests to validate the logic of a unit/method/function of .NET code is nothing new, but many of the day-to-day applications we develop have business logic in the database tier that can be difficult to validate and regression test.  SQL Server Data Tools allows developers to create Test Projects, which can be used to build up a repository of automated tests designed to validate the functionality of the objects in a SQL Server database (e.g. Constraints, Stored Procedures, UDFs, View, etc).  In this session we will demonstrate how to use SSDT Test Projects to unit test your databases.  This presentation is almost entirely demonstration of the tools, but there are a couple slides to review :-)
