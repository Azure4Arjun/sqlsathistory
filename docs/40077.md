## Title: Trust Your Data with Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### This session will step through the fundamentals that go into assessing existing data quality issues as well as an introduction on how to use Microsoft's Data Quality Services to address those issues. The presentation will begin by discussing techniques to uncover pain points that may currently exists within your data. We will step through techniques for stakeholder discussions and things to look for when profiling your data. In the second half of the session, we will transition into a demo that introduces the capabilities of Data Quality Services. I will discuss the major functions of Data Quality Services such as, Knowledge Bases, domains, and matching. My goal at the end of the session is for each participant to have a good baseline understanding of what to look for when assessing quality within their data, as well as, how to begin solving the issues they find.
