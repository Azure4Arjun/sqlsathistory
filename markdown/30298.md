## Title: Microsoft Data Mining Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### In the book, Data Mining with Microsoft SQL Server 2008, the author defines data mining as “the process of analyzing data to find hidden patterns using automatic methodologies”. In this session, we will look at what data mining is and what are some advantages of using it.  We will also take a look at what data mining can do for you by reviewing some of the problems that it can be used to address and the cost of implementing it. I will demonstrate how easy it is to use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) to build and analyze models using existing data.
