## Speaker: Jason Virtue
## Title: Power BI Data Visualizations
## Abstract:
### Many of us over the years have wanted to customize legend colors, axis or title labels in Power BI.  Each one of us have thought I really want to use a different type of visualization that is not available in Power BI.  This session will help answer these questions and showcase the new out-of-the-box visualizations, changing chart properties and new custom visualizations.  Microsoft enables developers thru D3.js, SVG and other graphical technologies to create their own custom visualizations.  The new chart types will be able to be published into Power BI so you can leverage any visualization that you want to use from Box chart to sunburst diagrams.  This session will showcase the new features and discuss at a high-level what you need to get started creating your own visualizations.
