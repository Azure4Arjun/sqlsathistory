## Title: Architectural Designs Driving SQL Server Performance  Availability
## Abstract:
### DBAs are often asked to design database infrastructure for new applications or upgrade existing systems. Therefore, they must have a keen understanding of the application’s requirements, operational environment, and infrastructure so they can recommend the best approach.

In this session, you’ll learn about the latest advancements in storage technology, the various ways flash can be deployed (flash caching, server-side PCIe flash, hybrid, and all-flash), and the pros and cons for each. We’ll also discuss how a well-designed infrastructure can drive efficiencies and help your organization save on licensing and maintenance costs.
