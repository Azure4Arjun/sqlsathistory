## Title: Using Always Encrypted in Real World
## Abstract:
### Worried about security? Worried about compliance? Worried that someone might get at your sensitive data? 
In this session you will find out how using Always Encrypted, Azure regions and Azure KeyVault you can keep your data secure.
I will demonstrate the technology  and some scenarios presented to us (including challenges), what was required for the implementation of Always Encrypted considering the current model and the limitations of the feature, the reasons that led us to choose the path of Azure Regions with Always Encrypted, lessons learned as well as some cool things about the feature.
