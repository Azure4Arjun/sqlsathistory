## Title: How are your SSAS cubes and Tabular Models Performing
## Abstract:
### Which objects within your SSAS cubes or models are consuming the most CPU?  Which objects are using the most memory?  What MDX query is running the longest? What are the top 10 MDX queries consuming resources? Which objects (dimensions or facts) are having the most cache misses?  Which of your measure groups are having the most aggregation misses.

You could be the hero of your BI group in recommending changes to the cube or model structures and in planning when to purchase more memory or storage.  By using SSAS Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) or using PowerShell scripts to collect statistics on SSAS Performance Counters, you can easily build charts and reports to identify resource bottlenecks in your SSAS cubes and models.


Both SSAS multidimensional cubes and Tabular models consume system resources differently; but you  can collect data and store performance  statistics in SQL tables to build your performance monitoring solution for both types.
