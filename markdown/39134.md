## Speaker: Alain Dormehl
## Title: Analytics Platform System - SQL 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse vs SQL 201x
## Abstract:
### This session will cover some of the key fundamentals that differentiate SMP SQL from MPP SQL (SQL 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse vs SQL 201x) . 
I will go over some of the architectural implementations that make MPP SQL Possible, and that offer its ground breaking performance. Will also briefly cover scenarios where APS will shine and scenarios which are not ideal for APS as well as some of the current limitations on APS. 
I have access to an actual APS appliance (AU3) so we will be running side by side queries on a comparative SQL 201x Environment and then on the APS to show the performance of an APS as a data warehousing solution. 
Some of the specific side by side comparisons we will run: 
Data Loads - BCP, SSIS and BULK INSERT vs DWLoader.exe 
Data Transformation - CTAS, CRTAS
BI Demonstration - Connecting Excel directly to 30 million + rows and doing a real time pivot without a cube off the back of APS. 
Lastly will cover some of the hybrid hadoop functionality with APS CETAS
