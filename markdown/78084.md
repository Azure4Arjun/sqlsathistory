## Title: Intro to Query Store
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Tuning capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016 and 2017.
