# SQLSaturday #34 - Boston 2010
Event Date: 30-01-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Bala Subra
## Title: SQL Server Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### This session will be a cornucopia of three sub-sessions. The first part will be to convince the skeptics. Why does every organization should consider SQL Server Reporting as part of its front-end solution? What will SSRS do better than a typical web application/site or a client-server application? The second portion will be a quick demo of the possibility and will be the shortest. The final part will talk about the best practices, tips from the field and will cover the implementation techniques.
