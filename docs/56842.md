## Title: Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is data, which has grown enormous and complex. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but beside the point. It takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time is expensive.

Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each might require terabytes of storage. So, everyone is limited to working in a small shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers, and the pace of delivery fails to live up to requirements.

Data virtualization is the solution.  Come learn.
