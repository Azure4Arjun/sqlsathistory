## Title: F# Type Providers Change The Way You Interact With Data Sources
## Abstract:
### F# is the functional language that ships with Visual Studio.  It is a great language that combines the power of functional programming with the benefits of being a 1st class citizen in the .NET stack.  One feature unique to F# is type providers.  Type providers are constructs to allow you to dynamically connect and consume data sources ranging from Sql Server to Json to Hadoop to MongoDb and everything in between.  Type providers are particularly useful analyzing very large datasets where it is impossible to code-gen the schema.  They are also very useful for developers who want to write fewer bugs.
