## Speaker: Volodymyr Usarskyy
## Title: To NHibernate or not to NHibernate
## Abstract:
### Every developer heard at least once about NHibernate. There are lots of articles and performance tests describing how fast it runs and how easy is to integrate NHibernate into your application.

In this session I will try to explain why would one consider NHibernate as an option for his application stack, how to solve typical DBA complaints and give a brief comparison of how fast is NHibernate versus ADO.NET with stored procedures.

This session will be interesting to application developers who never worked with NHibernate but want to start, as well as for DBAs to gather some knowledge about how an application works including database layer.
I will also provide some demos to show why NHibernate is not as good as developers might think, and why it is better than DBAs think about this tool.
