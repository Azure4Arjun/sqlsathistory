## Abstract:
### The release of SQL Server 2012 brings long-awaited technologies and improved scalability to the database platform.  
While historical best practices will continue to apply, added product features such as AlwaysOn, PowerView, Column Store, now brings an extra dimension to consider when deploying and optimizing storage for SQL Server 2012.
