## Title: Building Your Professional Development Plan
## Abstract:
### Plan the work and work the plan. Are you doing that when it comes to your professional development? Few of us have a formal approach to professional development and that usually means it gets pushed down the list as other things in life happen. This session is designed to get you thinking about all aspects of your career and from there moves into a discussion about time and money - how much of each are you willing to spend to get where you want to go? At the end of this presentation you'll be ready for spend a couple quiet hours charting all the things you want to do, and then figuring out which ones you really want to do.
