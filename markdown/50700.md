## Title: Build on-the-fly reporting with Dynamic SQL
## Abstract:
### Using Dynamic SQL, grouping  windowing techniques, and cursors, one  can dynamically build a report with specifications that are stored in tables. In this session, we will look at each of the techniques used in building an employee report card that is completely driven by formula and scoring calculations stored in the database. We will also look at how everything is put together to create a truly dynamic report that can be used, created and maintained by different teams.
