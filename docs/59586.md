## Speaker: Doug McClurg
## Title: Operationalizing Digital and Enterprise Data in Hybrid Azure
## Abstract:
### Many companies match, merge, and enrich their customer data on premises in the enterprise, but their most valuable marketing systems operate and leverage customer data off premises in the digital realm. Moreover, digital data tends to manifest itself in an semi-structured (clickstream) and unstructured (images) format while enterprise data still tends to be structured. How do you combine customer behavior and attributes to drive marketing in a world such as this? Because this is only a 60 minute session, I am going to layout and demo an architecture as well as discuss production implications in terms of IT and the Business.
