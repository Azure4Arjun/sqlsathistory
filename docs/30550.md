## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Index Black Ops
## Abstract:
### There's a lot that goes on under the covers of SQL Server with your indexes.  But it's not as secretive as you might think.  Most of this information is made available to you through DMVs.  While this information is useful - you need a clear understanding of what is in the DMVs in order to understand what is going on.  In this session we'll take a dive into sys.dm_index_operational_stats to find out what it does and what you can do with this information.
