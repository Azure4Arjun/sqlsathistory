## Title: Using SSRS to report on IIS Web Logs
## Abstract:
### Join us to find out how you can use tools that have no cost (either free or part of SQL Server) to build web site usage analysis reports. We'll use Microsoft's free tool, LogParser to load the data into SQL Server, then we'll use SQL Server Reporting Services to build reports of that data. Finally, we'll deliver those reports inside SharePoint, using SQL Server Reporting Services running in SharePoint Integrated Mode.
