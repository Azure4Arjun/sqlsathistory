## Title: Get Cert! Get Cred!
## Abstract:
### Obtaining a certification may be a dreaded and stressing process for some people. Most people fail because of their failure to plan a realistic roadmap towards their goals and not necessarily because they lack the skills. This session will focus on establishing a roadmap towards certification success for the MCTS and MCITP programs of SQL Server and Business Intelligence. I will do a quick overview of my recent success obtaining 4 certifications in 30 days and how you can achieve similar goals. But why certify? Join me to find out the opportunities you may be missing on!
