## Title: Into a Swan - Discovering the Beauty of RESTORE
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs believe that a backup is the most important process to implement. For most, they soon realize that the most important process to the business is actually the restore. In this session, we’ll start by exploring some of the options in the SSMS restore wizard, but will quickly move to T-SQL to discover the power and beauty that writing the RESTORE statement can provide. In addition to the classic RESTORE DATABASE and LOG statements, we’ll work through some real world examples of how to leverage some of the lesser known syntax of the restore statement to help in both foreign and well known environments.
