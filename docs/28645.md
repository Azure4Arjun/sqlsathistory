## Title: First Flight: Taking off with Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Come learn how to create your first cube using SSAS.  In this session, we will start from scratch and
create an Analysis Services solution including setting up the data  source, data source view, dimensions, hierarchies, 
attribute relationships, and creating some custom measures.  At the end of the session we will browse the cube using Excel
to create some ad-hoc reports.
