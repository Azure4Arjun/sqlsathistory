## Title: Asynchronous programming with Service Broker
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore Service Broker, one of the lesser known features available since Microsoft SQL Server 2005. This technology provides a robust asynchronous programming model and can be reliably used to develop lightning fast applications that scale very well and can boost your application's throughput. We will look at a few examples of real world service broker implementations in OLTP as well as batch processing modes. We will also discuss some of the commonly used tools for troubleshooting a service broker set up, as well as some few to avoid common pitfalls.
