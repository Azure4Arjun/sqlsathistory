## Title: Query Tuning Superstardom for Beginners
## Abstract:
### In this session aimed at the novice query tuner we'll explore what big results may be yielded through the smallest of query tweaks. We will explore impacts of removing unnecessary joins, predicate blunders and problems with returning too much information.  The end result is to improve those bad queries and make you look like a tuning superstar.
