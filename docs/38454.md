## Title: Reliable data consistency with constraints and access layers
## Abstract:
### This session demonstrates the usage of database core concepts for data modelling which prevents data manipulation from outside (application / direct). By usage of constraints, schemas and reusable data layers your data model becomes more reliable.

Control data access by using dedicated access methods with stored procedures and Views. This session demonstrates with two small independent applications the topic of reusability of common database objects.
