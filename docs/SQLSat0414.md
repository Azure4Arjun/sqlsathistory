# Securing your SQL Azure Database. How?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-414)
Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Boris Hristov
## Title: Securing your SQL Azure Database. How?
## Abstract:
### Do you think that your data is not secured in the cloud? Is that one of the reasons for you to not migrate at least some workloads there? Things changed in the last few months in terms of Azure database security. In this session we will take a closer look at what the features Row Level Security(RLS) and Dynamic Data Masking can do for your business and how they can help you secure your data.

# End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-414)
Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: BI Analytics  Visualization
## Speaker: Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: End to end risk assessment – affordable solution using Power BI
## Abstract:
### Risk assessment is becoming an integral part of many organizations. In order to do it successfully you need to do it regularly and consistently. You need to register the risk factors, the risks them self, evaluate them and then plan the actions required to mitigate them. Besides the registration you need to have compelling and easy reading reports that help managers quickly find how the assessment is going. The familiar Excel interface helps assessors register the risk factors and risks and then plan the actions. The solutions then uses Power Query to load data into PowerPivot without overwriting and the Power View to report the results. The results can then be monitored in Power BI. 

This method can easily transfer to any other data collection solution such as budgeting or incident registration

# Data modeling for data analysis and cubes
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-414)
Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 09:00:00 - Track: BI Architecture  Development
## Speaker: Alex Whittles
## Title: Data modeling for data analysis and cubes
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services OLAP cubes provide an incredibly powerful platform for the analysis and reporting of complex data. Unfortunately we often find that our source data is not in the right structure to make the best use of the cube’s power. This limits the cube’s functionality, compromises performance and complicates the reports.
In this session we’ll look at a number of different data scenarios that we encounter and explore ways of remodelling the data within the data warehouse to optimize it for cubes and MDX. We’ll see how adding functionality into the ETL layer and data warehouse can have a dramatic effect on the functionality and simplicity of the cube.

## Speaker: Cédric Charlier
## Title: Automating the testing of your BI solutions with NBi
## Abstract:
### If you want to accelerate the testing of your BI solutions, the best strategy is the automation of your tests with the help of a dedicated framework. During this session, we’ll take a look to the features of the open-source framework named “NBi” (nbi.codeplex.com). This framework is providing support for automated tests on the fields of databases, cubes, reports and ETLs, without the need of .Net skills. The demos will show us the best approaches to quickly and effectively assert the quality of BI developments. We'll go a step further, generating the tests by an interesting system of templates and test-cases sources.

Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 14:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Matan Yungman
## Title: The Data Loading Performance Presentation
## Abstract:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be a challenging task. When doing it, there are quite a few factors that can help or hurt you.

For that, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it.

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and talk about the ways you can optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

Among other topics, we will talk about the #1 enemy of high performance data loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Load, indexing techniques, properly leveraging parallelism and partitioning, SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability, and more.

## Speaker: Margarita Naumova
## Title: A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management
## Abstract:
### As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined. You will have a clear understanding of cache plan problems and how to avoid them.

## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI Analytics  Visualization
## Speaker: Terry McCann
## Title: SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.
## Abstract:
### Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB.
