## Title: Easy Database Refactoring with SQL Server Database
## Abstract:
### Database development can be a daunting task when modifying many objects for a project or coordinating schema changes across a team of developers.  Implementing those changes can be equally problematic, particularly when deploying them to different versions of the same database.  SSDT makes database refactoring a breeze â€“ tracking renamed objects, preventing data loss during deployment and maintaining references between objects in a database.  See the latest features in SSDT and learn how to create and work within a database project.  Learn the tips and tricks in Visual Studio that will cut your development effort and allow you to deploy 100s of changes without missing an object, with better quality code.
