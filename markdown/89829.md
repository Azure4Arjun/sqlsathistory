## Title: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter
## Abstract:

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.
