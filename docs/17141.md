## Title: Performance tuning a PowerPivot and Tabular model, notes from the field
## Abstract:
### In-memory means blazingly fast, at least most of the time.

Join me on a session of improving a malfunctioning PowerBI Excel sheet and pick up handy tips and tricks you will need to tune your xVelocity models.
