# SQLSaturday #950 - Victoria 2020
Event Date: 14-03-2020 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Admin
## Speaker: Randolph West
## Title: Database administration through the ages
## Abstract:
### You're a lone DBA and you've heard all the buzzwords about Linux and Azure and containers, and it's all a bit overwhelming. Are you really missing out?

Join me on an exploration of what it means to be a DBA in the modern era, and how your existing skills can be leveraged, no matter the platform. Maintenance plans, monitoring, even disaster recovery all work in pretty much the same way across Windows, Linux, Azure SQL DB, and containers.

Then when you go back to work on Monday, you will have a starting point on how to modernize your existing environment and future-proof your career.
