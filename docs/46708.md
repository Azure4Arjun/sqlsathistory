## Title: Fast and Furious: Discovering Windowing Function
## Abstract:
### The Windowing Functions are advanced SQL Server commands, existing since 2005, but many database developers forget to use them. In this session we will discuss about how they work, how we should use them and how we can combine them with other development techniques as the use of CTE, procedures, functions, etc.
