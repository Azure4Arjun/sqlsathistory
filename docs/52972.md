## Title: IoT â€“ Particle Photon to Azure and PowerBI integration
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction into integrating the Particle Photon Wi-Fi development kit and Microsoft Azure to analyze, collect, and provide PowerBI reports on IoT data. 

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable publish-subscribe event ingestor that can intake millions of events per second to process and analyze massive amounts of data. Once collected into Event Hubs the data can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or a batching/storage adapters.

The Particle Photon has a simple but very robust development environment. When combined with Microsoft Azure using webhooks it is capable of ingesting millions of events per second using a remotely programmable Particle Photon. 

For this training we will specifically look at publishing data from a Particle Photon (equipped with a Photon Weather Shield) to an Azure Event Hub. Next we will store the data using blog storage, SQL database, and data lake storage to then graphically represent the IoT data in PowerBI.
