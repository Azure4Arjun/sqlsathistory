## Title: First Day on the Job: Getting to Know Your Database
## Abstract:
### You're starting a new job as one of the database people, whether it is an analyst, developer, DBA, or other role. You are dealing with a new system and new practices versus your previous gig or four. Now you're already getting tasks to make changes on the development server or run some reports on data in production, but aren't sure where everything is or how they do it. So what's the best way to get up to speed? In this session, we discuss good ways to get familiar with the servers and databases, the potential architecture surrounding them (transactional and analytical), any source control, and other aspects to keep an eye on. You can start delivering the goods and swim in your new database environment without drowning!
