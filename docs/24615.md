## Title: Reporting Services In An AlwaysOn World
## Abstract:
### While we don’t always see SQL Server Reporting Services as a mission-critical function, reporting has become more and more important with the BI explosion.  Reports are driving crucial business decisions and providing invaluable information to users on a daily basis.  With the introduction of AlwaysOn in SQL Server 2012, it seemed like Reporting Services was forgotten when it comes to HA support.  In this talk, we’ll look at possible HA solutions for the ReportServer databases along with application servers.  We’ll also discuss some of the challenges that arise from it and how to navigate them as best possible.
