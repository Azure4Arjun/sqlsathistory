## Title: Extended Events In Real Life
## Abstract:
### Extended Events, introduced in SQL Server 2008 are here to stay. When combined with the fact that Profiler for Trace is a deprecated feature we're going to need to learn how to use Extended Events to monitor our server. In this session we're going to step through some real-world uses of Extended Events including Statistics capture, Default Trace replacement, system_health analysis, and insight into the DBCC CHECKDB process (NEW IN SQL 2014)!
