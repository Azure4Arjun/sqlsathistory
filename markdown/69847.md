## Title: Baseball Analytics: SQL Server 2016 In-Database R
## Abstract:
### This session is meant to dive into the world of R using awesome data to make learning memorable.  We will discuss a brief overview of the syntax, how to write an In-Database R query, and then dive into a data set using the Lahman database  data from Retrosheets.org to examine baseball games from 1990 â€“ 2016 to answer the following questions: If I want to see my team win a game should I go to a double header?  What is the best day of the week to see my team play?  What is the best day if they are above .500 or below?  What if they have home vs. away games?  Then we will display the results in Power BI or and Excel Dashboard. Come for the Science stay for the data!
