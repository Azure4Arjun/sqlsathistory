## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Database Administration for the non-DBA
## Abstract:
### So you are a developer or a systems admin and you've just been handed a SQL Server database and you've got no idea what to do with it.  I've got some of the answers here in this session for you.  During this session we will cover a variety of topics including backup and restore, recovery models, database maintenance, compression, data corruption, database compatibility levels and indexing.

While this session won't teach you everything you need to know, it will give you some insights into the SQL Server database engine and give you the ability to better know what to look for.
