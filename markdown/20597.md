## Title: SSIS Logging Reconsidered
## Abstract:
### The advent of SQL Server 2012, SQL Server Data Tools and Integration Services Catalogs have significantly improved out of the box logging.  Unfortunately, logging best practices have not evolved with the new logging tools.  This talk will outline the logging available “out of the box” with SSIS and discuss the implications for “traditional” ETL logging.  Logging best practices will vary by business, industry and regulatory environments.  We will review examples from the most basic operational logging to the most sophisticated logging required for auditing and regulatory compliance.
