Event Date: 05-10-2019 - Session time: 16:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Larry Blake
## Title: Database DevOps with Visual Studio and Jenkins
## Abstract:
### Are your database releases time-consuming, complicated, and exception-driven?  Do you wish you could deploy just a few of the changes from database 1 to database 2?  Does your boss say “we should do more of this DevOps stuff”?  Time to think about automation.

Keeping your “desired state” database in version control is the first step toward easy, repeatable deployments.  When your database contains exactly what it’s supposed to, there’s no such thing as “but it worked in Dev.”  And that’s just the beginning.

Join Larry Blake and Shantan Kallu from Teach for America to learn how they created custom Jenkins pipelines to automate deployments, run unit tests, introduce code review approval steps, manage logins, and more.  No Jenkins knowledge is assumed.
