## Title: Big Data Analytics Reference Architectures
## Abstract:
### Big Data is a hot topic nowadays. But, how to design robust and scalable architecture according to business needs? Could we use Traditional Analytics (BI) approach here? Let's dive together and learn how to use Attribute-Driven Design approach in order to identify key architecture drivers and map it with reference architectures. We also will look at technologies as building blocks for those architectures and some practical use cases for better understanding how it works.
