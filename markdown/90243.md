## Title: The Couchbase data platform - perform at any scale, manage with ease
## Abstract:
### Couchbase is the NoSQL data platform for business critical applications where performance, scalability and agile development are a must, and also easy to use and administer. 
In this session we'll take a peek at Couchbase and see how it incorporates multiple distributed and scalable engines such as caching, document based DB, full text search, analytics, eventing, active-active masterless replication - all in a single integrated platform. 
Couchbase also offers a full fledge SQL-like language (N1QL) supporting inner/outer joins, aggregations, subqueries and everything you know from SQL.
