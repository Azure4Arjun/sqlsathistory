## Speaker: Thomas Hütter
## Title: 50 ways to show your data
## Abstract:
### „A picture is worth a thousand words“ - well, that is especially true when it comes to analyzing data. Visualization is the quick and easy way to get the big ‘picture’ in your data and the R ecosystem has a lot to offer in this regard. 

They may not add up to exactly 50, but in this session I’ll show you lots of compelling visualizations produced with the help of the ggplot2 package and friends - and their usual small effort of coding. We will start beyond the usual bar, line or scatter plots. 

Instead our screen will show diagrams that always made you think „How do they do that?“. We will see waterfall diagrams, violins, ridgelines, marginal histograms, maps and more… and you’ll get the code to reproduce everything.
