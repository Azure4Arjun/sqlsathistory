## Title: Schema Design: Advanced Data Validation Techniques
## Abstract:
### Fixing bad data is a huge problem. How about if you could design your schema so that it checked the data on the way in?

The beginner-level techniques here are very important and useful: primary key, alternate key/unique index, foreign key, etc. But what else can you do to lock down the data in your database? You will leave this session with a better understanding of the normal techniques and some new ones that you probably haven't used before.
