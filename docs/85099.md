## Title: Deadlocks: What they are and how to resolve them
## Abstract:
### Deadlocks are a swear word in DB world. They always tend to happen at the worst possible time, are extremely difficult to recreate and the deadlock graph looks like some sort of abstract art.

So when your DBA tells you that you need to fix a deadlock: what is it and how should you go about resolving it?
