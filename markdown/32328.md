## Title: A Whirlwind Tour of Contained Databases and TSQL e
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 will introduce the concept of a contained database . CDBs represent a fundamental shift in the architecture of SQL Server that will simplify the development and management of SQL Server applications. Without containment, SQL Server databases are highly intertwined with the instance on which they reside. This entanglement complicates application development, deployment, and management tasks.
