# Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#153-Salt-Lake-City-2012)
Event Date: 20-10-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Martin Miller
## Title: Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling
## Abstract:
### Data modeling is all about representing the real world in the database, and for 30 years the ER Model has been the preferred method for designing databases where the goal is to "get the data in" by capturing business transactions. But the ER Model is not the most efficient model where the goal is to "get the data back out". The Dimensional Model allows us to take a very different look at all that data and restructure it in a way that is optimized for aggregation and summarizing so that we can unlock its information potential and build effective "Business Intelligence" systems. This presentation takes you "through the looking glass" to introduce you to a world of "fact tables", "dimensions", "star schemas" and more.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Release Management: A Necessary Evil
## Abstract:
### The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. We will discuss various terms, processes, ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.

## Speaker: Kelly Martinez
## Title: What Every DBA Should Know About NoSQL
## Abstract:
### NoSQL is one of the hot "new" things in the developer world. As DBAs inevitably someone will come to us for help or advice on (or possibly choosing) a NoSQL solution. This session aims to give you a basic understanding in order to best answer those questions for your organization.

In this presentation I will cover: What exactly NoSQL is (and is not), ACID compliance of some popular NoSQL solutions, main differences between traditional RDBMS and NoSQL, why NoSQL popular with developers, and when you might (or might not) want to leverage it for a solution.
