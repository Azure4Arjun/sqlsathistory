## Title: Database Corruption
## Abstract:
### Database corruption could happen to you. This could potentially be one of the worst nightmares you could experience in the database world.  In this session I will be talking about what database corruption is. I will also give a lesson on how dbcc works and the limitation of it. I will give examples of database corruption and how to resolve them.
I will also give examples of how to verify integrity of backups. Backups are essentially the last resort for resolving database corruption.
