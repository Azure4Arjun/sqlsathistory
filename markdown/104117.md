## Title: SQL Server Policies -  Underused Method for Configuring Your Database Server and Enforcing Standards
## Abstract:
### As a DBA for a financial clearing house and we are audited by multiple government regulators to 
make sure our database instances are configured to standards. When configuring an instance we have a checklist of configurations which must adhere to those standards. Then those configurations must be monitored to make sure they remain set according to those standards. This is time consuming, and labor intensive. If only there was a quick way to template those standards so that they could easily be applied and enforced to database instances. Well one way that can be done with SQL Server Policies !! SQL Server Policies can be used to both configure and enforce standards within a database instance. SQL Server Policies have been around since SQL Server 2008 , but have not gained much traction in the industry. SQL Server Policies been the "Rodney Dangerfield" of SQL Server features getting no respect. I'll show you how I used this feature to configure and enforce standards.
