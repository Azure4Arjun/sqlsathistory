## Title: SQL Server Statistics
## Abstract:
### Why does SQL Server need statistics? How and when are they created and maintained? How do you know when they are incorrect or out of date? How much difference do they make in query plans? We'll answer all of those questions and more! You'll leave the session with a firm understanding of the working of statistics and what you need to know to keep them in great condition.
