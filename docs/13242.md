## Title: The Care  Feeding of Analysis Services in Production
## Abstract:
### A lot of the information you'll find on Analysis Services is focused around the initial creation of databases and models, but once you have a solution deployed to production then what?

In this session we will look at what it takes to run an Analysis Services server in production. What are the basics that you need to know about how the server works. Including things like threading, memory usage and locking. How can you monitor the health of your server? What tools can you use to find out what's happening on your server? We'll have a look at what you should be monitoring to make sure your system is running properly and run through what to investigate went things don't run as smoothly as you'd like.
