## Title: MDX: Troubleshooting Tips  Tricks
## Abstract:
### We all know that MDX is not an easy language, and cryptic (or no) error messages make it even more difficult to figure out where you have gone wrong.

In this session I will share (and demonstrate) very useful ways to find out the reason(s) behind your MDX query not returning the correct results...or any results for that matter.
