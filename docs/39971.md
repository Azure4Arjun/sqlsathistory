## Title: Quick Start Guide to JavaScript Frameworks for SharePoint Apps
## Abstract:
### Learn about JavaScript frameworks and new developer practices in SharePoint and on Office 365. JavaScript frameworks are there for you to help you develop faster and easier. You don't need to do your apps from scratch.
Apps and the cloud app model have brought not only new ways to interact, send, write, and receive data from SharePoint. Apps have also brought JavaScript frameworks into SharePoint development. JavaScript frameworks are right there as part of the app template when you start a SharePoint hosted or a Cloud app. In this session, I'll show what you can do with JavaScript frameworks that are part of the app template. I'll show jQuery, Bootstrap, and modernizr.
