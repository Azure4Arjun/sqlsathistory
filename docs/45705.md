## Title: TempDB… Do this and don’t do that.
## Abstract:
### There are many rules, suggestions and tips that tell you to do this or don’t do that with TempDB. In this session we will explore the reasons behind many of the recommendations or best practices for TempDB. 
We will start by taking a look at what TempDB is, how it is used, and why this is important to your SQL Server. Next explore why TempDB needs more than one file and how many files TempDB is needed? We will look at why TempDB should be on a different logical drive, even if you are using a SAN. Explore why you should run DBCC CheckDB on my TempDB. Does the auto growth on TempDB really matter, what are these VLFs and how does that impact performance? Take away the knowledge that you need to properly manage TempDB on all your SQL Servers.
