## Title: The 'Secret Sauce' in your Big Data: R, HDInsight and PowerBI
## Abstract:
### Big Data is not so much about storing massive amounts of data in a common database. It is also a force of change for the organisation, and it means that we have to consider the collective capabilities of the platform to serve the business: from data source to secret sauce to help the business to make data-driven decisions to drive the enterprise forward. How can you get your organisation's secret sauce? Data scientists need a way of combining the scalability of Big Data with the ability to conduct extensive data analysis to obtain the 'secret sauce'. In this session, we will look at R, the world's favourite free data analysis tool, and HDInsight, which is Microsoft's distribution of Hadoop. In this session, we will look at an end-to-end solution to discover our secret sauce from data ingredients. We will then visualise the results in Microsoft's latest BI toolset, Power BI.
