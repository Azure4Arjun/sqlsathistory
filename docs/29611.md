## Title: Getting the most out of SharePoint Search
## Abstract:
### The number one complaint about Enterprise Search is usually summed up by a statement like this: “I can’t find anything!”. Whether you are using SharePoint Foundation with Search Server Express, SharePoint Server 2010, or FAST Search for SharePoint, the quality of the results you receive from search is only as good as the input you give it. Out-of-the-box, SharePoint gives you a very functional search engine, but you need to do some work to really enable the full power it provides. This intro level talk will teach you the basics of Enterprise Search in SharePoint. Here you will learn about the basic building blocks such as content sources, crawled properties, managed properties, and scopes.
