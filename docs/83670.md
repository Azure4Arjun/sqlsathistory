## Title: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the Query Store
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of SQL 2016, Query Store has become a unique tool in the DBA toolkit for its almost surgical like performance adjustment capability for systems.  This session will show how to use this feature in adjusting the performance of your SQL Servers in a much more granular way than the impact of using other performance tools that are available to the DBA - comparing and contrasting the Query Store with the traditional methods along the way.  It will also show you how to monitor the impact of your changes, and the changes in the environment, from using Query Store.  Finally the session will cover the basic architecture of query store, the reporting environment, and the DMVs that support query store.
