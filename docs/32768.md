## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: OLTP (yes!) Databases and Cube Design
## Abstract:
### OLAP, Cube, BI, SSAS -- what is the difference? In this session look at the difference between a database designed for OLAP and OLTP -- star and snowflake schemas and the benefits and costs of each. After we understand what is sourcing a cube we will look at the basic cube structure, how to source from OLTP or OLAP database and the cost of ROLAP, HOLAP and MOLAP. I have implemented many cubes for small finance departments allowing them to browse a nightly set of data in Excel, without them downloading spreadsheets of data during production hours. The cube improved overall system performance without a redesigned database.
