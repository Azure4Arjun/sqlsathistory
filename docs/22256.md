## Title: Using NULL the Right Way
## Abstract:
### Over the years, I have seen NULL abused in many ways, often to the detriment of the application.  This session will help you gain a deeper appreciation for what seems, on the surface, to be a simple topic.  We will dig into how NULLs impact schema semantics, storage internals, and query performance.
