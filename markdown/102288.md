## Speaker: Daniel Glenn
## Title: Give Power [BI] to the people - securely share your insights
## Abstract:
### Every organization is a data organization and you must collaborate on data to stay on track. Sharing insights from within Power BI will give you an advantage and help steer your organization in the right direction.
However there are some pitfalls with sharing - if you don’t know your options and set proper governance, you could be on your way to leaking data to outside your company.

In this session, you will get a short introduction to Power BI and understand where data resides, why and how you should share with your colleagues and outside partners, and a strategy for setting governance on sharing your data. You will walk away with the outline of a governance plan, an understanding of your sharing options, and the sharing settings you should immediately turn off.
