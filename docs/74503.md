## Title: Brand yourself like a pro 2.0 "How to tell the story"
## Abstract:
### There are many "social media outlets" but not all of them are "the right one" for you, especially if you don't have a brand. 
Building a brand has to be intentional. You cannot just be you. Discovering the things that make you unique is not enough. You have to package these things in a way that highlights and perhaps even over exaggerates them.
In this interactive session, you will learn how to use Social Media to create your personal brand to positioning yourself as a pro, telling the story in the way that the people want to hear at the same time that you increase your self-confidence.
