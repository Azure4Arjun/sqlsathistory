## Title: The ABCs of SSIS
## Abstract:
### This presentation shows the basics of SSIS to help with automating database tasks, such as maintenance, importing and exporting data, or ETL transactions.  The discussion will start with an understanding of when SSIS should be used vs. when a database object, such as a view or stored procedure.  You will also learn about the different categories of transformations, see how to create a basic package, and how to use package configurations.  Lastly, we will talk about the importance of organizing the overall SSIS structure.
