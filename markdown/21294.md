## Title: SQL Server 2012 Database Engine – Why Upgrade?
## Abstract:
### There seems to be lots of buzz about AlwaysOn (new high availability \ disaster recovery feature) and new BI features in SQL Server 2012. But, what else do you need to be aware of specifically for the database engine to make your case for upgrading? This session will provide an overview of changes to the installation process, enhancements for manageability (PowerShell updates, new DMVs and T-SQL functions), updates to security features and more! You’ll leave this session with a list of SQL Server 2012 features to help you develop your upgrade justification.
