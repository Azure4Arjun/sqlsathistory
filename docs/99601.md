## Title: Going Beyond the Basics with Query Store
## Abstract:
### The query store, introduced with SQL 2016, has proven to be a valuable tool for gaining insight into performance issues and applying some basic first aid to troublesome queries.  With SQL 2017, the ability to do automatic regression correction was introduced.  Still, there are some limitations on what the query store can handle.  In this session we'll review some query store basics, talk about limitations, and explore a way to work around some of those limitations by using data stored in the query store.
