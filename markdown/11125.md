## Title: Friendlier Data Profiling with the SSIS Data Profiler Task
## Abstract:
### The SSIS Data Profiler Task contains great functionality, but is not very flexible nor dynamically configurable. Worse, it outputs to xml files only. In this session I will demonstrate an SSIS solution which uses dynamic expressions to flexibly configure what is profiled. The solution also writes to a custom database instead of xml, enabling trending, auditing and reporting. The solution will be made available to attendees.
