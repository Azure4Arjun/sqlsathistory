## Title: CAT: Azure SQL DB Premium â€“ Deep Dive and Mythbuster (IT)
## Abstract:
### There are a number of relational and non-relational storage options available on Azure including; Azure SQL DB, the new premium DB offering, SQL in a Virtual Machine and table storage.  In this session we will do a deep dive on the new Premium offering that Azure SQL Database has in preview.  We will describe how this is implemented and show you how to; determine in a systematic way when to use this technology, estimate your capacity needs, and give you an understanding of the performance and scale you can achieve when leveraging Azure SQL Database Premium and how this compares to storage technology and scale-out approaches on Azure.  You will understand how to select the most appropriate one for a certain scenario and have a practical understanding of what it can achieve. We will demonstrate the learnings and best practices gathered during real customer engagements over the last 12 months with the Premium Database.
