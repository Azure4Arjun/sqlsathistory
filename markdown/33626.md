## Title: Pro Tips: Tuning the data flow in ssis
## Abstract:
### Synchronous and asynchronous components, memory buffers, data type choices, Oh My! Tuning the data flow is all about choices. In this session we'll walk through some of the choices that can give you the biggest performance boosts in your ssis data flow. Together we'll work through the differences between synchronous and asynchronous components. We'll highlight components that should be avoided and explore alternates that can help us create the fastest data flow possible.
