## Speaker: Murilo Miranda
## Title: Clustered Instance - Storage Introduction
## Abstract:
### With the evolution of SQL Server new possibilities are being opened, and today we have a vast range of possibilities to achieve our objectives. For a clustered instance is not different, as nowadays a shared storage living in a SAN is not the only possibility. 

On this session I will introduce all the available ways to store database files in a clustered SQL Server instance, including the news of SQL Server 2014. If you never installed or even worked with a clustered instance, this is not an issue! A quick introduction about the role of clustered instance will be made.

I'll wait for you there!
