## Speaker: Christina Leo
## Title: What's Buried in the Plan Cache?
## Abstract:
### Creating a query plan can be a time consuming and expensive process. To avoid repeating these potentially costly steps, SQL Server stores its query plans, in the plan cache where they can be reused as needed.
 
In this session, we’ll look at how the plan cache is organized, what plans are saved, when plans are reused and when they are recreated, methods for observing the contents of the plan cache, and finally, methods for manipulating plan reuse and recreation.

# Performance Tuning 2012 SSIS Data Loads
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#119---Chicago-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Hope Foley
## Title: Performance Tuning 2012 SSIS Data Loads
## Abstract:
### Importing data is as common to SQL Server as bacon is to a savory breakfast sandwich. As most of us love to eat those breakfast sandwiches, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) loves to eat data in an Import/Export kind of way. Although a green chain of boxes in SSIS can be the ruling “Happy Dance” of any DBA or SQL Developer, we must still consider the performance of those tasks. In this session, we will go through performance tuning in SSIS 2012 after a successful SSIS package has been developed. When we are finished with this session, not only will you still have the mystic of green colors of successful execution of your SSIS import and export tasks, but the turbo boosters will be turned on as well.

# Administering the BI Stack
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#119---Chicago-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Josh Fennessy
## Title: Administering the BI Stack
## Abstract:
### More often than not, a SQL DBA will also be requested (or required) to administer *other* applications in the SQL universe.  These applications are often the BI stack, SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS.  In this session, you will learn not only what each of these applications does, but also some behind the scenes views into how they work.  At the end of this session, you will have a better feeling of what to look for when something goes wrong, and have the knowledge to be proactive with your Business Intelligence implementations.

This session will focus on the SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS engines in this session.  Not a session for developers, we will be focusing on the ADMINISTRATION of these applications/services only.

# The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#119---Chicago-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Norman Kelm
## Title: The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS
## Abstract:
### Everyday more DBAs and SQL developers are given responsibility for ETL development. They have a strong SQL background with little or no .Net language programming experience. As they progress with SSIS, they can come up against perceived limitations in the capabilities of SSIS using only the built-in tasks. What they may not realize is the extensibility available to SSIS via the Script Task. This presentation will provide them with the tools they need to move beyond that perceived limitation. Updated for SSIS 2012.

# Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop/Desktop?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#119---Chicago-2012)
Event Date: 19-05-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop/Desktop?
## Abstract:
### Over the years, one of the most common questions I am asked is, "How can I configure a cluster on my machine?" Ask no more! Production should never be the only place you have clusters. Having the ability to create a cluster that you can use as a sandbox for testing or as an instruction tool for presentations and demonstrations is something every DBA should have in their arsenal.

This session will demystify the "magic" behind configuring a cluster on your laptop or desktop using either Vmware Workstation or Microsoft's Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2, and show how to configure things like the virtual machines, the domain controller, and the iSCSI storage solution.

## Speaker: Ben DeBow
## Title: Build Your Own SQL Server Private Cloud
## Abstract:
### Do you know what SaaS and DaaS are? If not, you should. SQL Server as a service (SaaS) and database as a service (DaaS) are otherwise known as the private cloud – the ability to offer your customers (external or internal) a reliable, scalable, and manageable way to easily deploy SQL Server systems and databases. At the end of the day they essentially want to push a button and get what they asked for. This is what the private cloud experience should enable for them. While you may do some of this now, come learn how to take it to the next level and design a service offering that will enable your organization to be agile, yet not leave you tearing out your hair worrying about it.

## Abstract:
### Too often ETL systems do not incorporate error handling.  When things break at 2 AM – and they ALWAYS break at 2 AM – some poor on call person must get out of bed and deal with something that should have been caught and handled by the code itself.  This session will cover ways for you to help your poor on-call colleagues get a full night’s sleep, thereby gaining you their eternal gratitude.

## Title: Licensing SQL Server in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### Presentation on licensing, huh.  Boring? Maybe. Important? Absolutely!  Being a DBA isn't just all fun and games.  There are also some serious things to take care of. Licensing SQL Server is one of those and doing it right can mean the difference between a few thousand dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars.  This session will discuss how to license SQL Server specifically for the transition from a physical to a virtual environment. You'll find that maybe, more than anything else, it will be the way SQL Server is licensed that determines how you configure your entire virtual infrastructure.

## Speaker: Ted Krueger
## Title: Query Tuning for Developers and DBAs
## Abstract:
### As a seasoned DBA, we often forget the basics of query tuning may be an area others haven’t been introduced to. Tuning can be a mystery for developers and DBAs that are starting out with SQL Server. Each operation and its cost can lead to lengthy research escapades, determining if the work is even worth the time to attempt a change in the overall execution plan. This session is going to discuss the basics of tuning; however, we can't end there. The second half of the session, the discussion portion, will focus on the key operations in the execution plan. The overall goal of the session is to take away knowledge on how to start with a query and use execution plans to refine it and turn it into a finely tuned process.

## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Abstract:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Title: Compliance and Auditing in Sql Server
## Abstract:
### I have this database which must meet all of these governmental regulations.  Just like the government to make life a lot harder but wait, now they say I most also meet International regulations.  Can this be true?  Why me?  Let's look at what we can do to help us pass audits and comply with the laws around us.  I need to install TDE, what do I do? Move the database to other server, can I do that?  I used certificates, can I change them.  I don’t like governments making me do all this stuff, it complicates my database.  What does TDE do to my backups?  Can I remove it? Auditing, no, let’s run for the hills.  Let’s see how Sql Server can help us with these issues.

## Title: Master Data Services in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs at one time or another have been taught the importance of master data management(MDM), which is comprised of a set of processes and tools in order to keep your non-transactional data in a consistent state. However, with today’s fast paced environment and tightening budgets most DBAs lack the resources to properly implement it. With the upcoming release of SQL Server 2012, Microsoft has taken their second swipe at providing a tool known as Master Data Services(MDS) to aid the DBA in this endeavor. In this session, you will learn the how Master Data Services is implemented in SQL Server 2012, setting up models,  working through the Excel plug-in, and utilizing DQS and business rules to help with that dirty data.
