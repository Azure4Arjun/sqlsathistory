## Title: Service your Applications with WCF
## Abstract:
### Windows Communications Foundation is a part of the .NET Framework that provides a unified programming model for rapidly building service-oriented applications that communicate across the web and the enterprise.  You will learn why WCF exists and will get an introduction to the fundamental building blocks.  Weâ€™ll run through some practical examples as well.  This is an introductory level discussion on WCF, but requires at least an intermediate level .NET development experience.
