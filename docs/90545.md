## Title: Got the Consulting Itch?  The Ins and Outs of being a Contractor for a Living
## Abstract:
### Have you ever thought about becoming a Consultant, but just didn't know if it was the right fit for you?  In this session, I touch on various aspects of what being a consultant means, be it working for a consulting firm or independently for yourself.  I'll cover some skills that are necessary to succeed in this field, touch on aspects of owning your own business, discuss ways to build up a network, and draw attention to some questions you should be asking yourself and others before you make the leap.  By the end of the session, I hope you have enough information to know if becoming a consultant is the right choice for you or not.
