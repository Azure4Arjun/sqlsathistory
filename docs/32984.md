## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In the words of Brent Ozar (www.BrentOzar.com), "You can't be a great SQL developer without using Test Driven Development.  In the words of Grant Fritchey (www.ScaryDBA.com), "Test Driven Development with SQL Server made me want to tear my hair out."  Testing in T-SQL may be more cumbersome than in other development languages, but eventually all software must be tested.  How can you thoroughly test a data-dependent application without testing the data pieces that drive the application components?  If the database has problems, they will eventually affect the rest of the application.  This session explores the basics of Test-Driven Development:  unit tests; setting up test data; and automating your tests.
