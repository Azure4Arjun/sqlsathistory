## Title: Flash Disk Alternatives for SQL Server Databases
## Abstract:
### Flash disk and/or SSD technology options have been creeping into SQL Server database deployments more frequently. Knowing what options are out there and how they differ is key to successful deployments because the flash revolution is here to stay, and not all flash is created the same. Oracle ACE Bert Scalzo will present the many significantly different alternatives for utilizing flash disk and/or SSD in SQL Server deployments. Additionally, he will review SQL Server 2012 and 2014 features that support or best utilize flash.
