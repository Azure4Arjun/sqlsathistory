## Title: Recognizing the Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) Workload
## Abstract:
### If you are like many, you've been hearing a lot about Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) lately. PDW is Microsoft's appliance solution with SQL Server 2012 that allows massively parallel processing (MPP) of database workloads. But how do you know that you have a workload that requires or could benefit from MPP over the standard symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architecture? In this session, we'll review that question and more with a run through of how to identify MPP workloads? As part of the session, we'll also review some of the key components and differentiators of the PDW platform.  You'll leave this session with a clear understanding of the value that PDW can bring to an organization and the types of workloads that it is best suited for.
