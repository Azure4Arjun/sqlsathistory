## Title: Inside the Query Optimizer
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer is a black box.  It can be intimidating until you understand it.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.  This is the first step in learning how to use the Optimizer's rules to make your queries faster!
