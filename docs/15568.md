## Speaker: James Serra
## Title: What exactly is Business Intelligence?
## Abstract:
### BI is the “Gathering of data from multiple sources to present it in a way that allows executives to make better business decisions”. I will describe in more detail exactly what BI is, what encompasses the Microsoft BI stack, why it is so popular, and why a BI career pays so much. I will review specific examples from previous projects of mine that show the benefits of BI and its huge return-on-investment. I'll go into detail on the components of a BI solution, and I will discuss key concepts for successfully implementing BI in your organization.
