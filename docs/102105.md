## Title: 2017 SSIS Scale Out for High Availability
## Abstract:
### 2016 SSIS packages can access data anywhere throughout the network, but normally run on the server they are deployed on. And if something terrible happens to that server, the manual setup of the SSISDB can be time consuming. With 2017, SSIS packages can be deployed once and run on several servers, even simultaneously. At this meetup, Paul LaGrone will teach you how to set up 2017 SSIS Scale Out packages so that your SSIS packages can now be in a Highly Available and Disaster Recovery environment.
