## Title: Database Hardening - Standardization, Optimization
## Abstract:
### Database Hardening - Standardization, Optimization, and Automation.  I will cover how I handle these issues in a very large environment that has over 500 database servers and 3600 databases.  My talk will touch on my use of PowerShell, Policy Based Management, the Enterprise Policy Management Framework, and an internally development DBA utility database to manage this inventory.
