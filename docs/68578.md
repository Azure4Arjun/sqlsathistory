## Title: Table Partitioning 101
## Abstract:
### Do you have large tables you can’t delete old data from or perform maintenance on?  Then this may be for you! Table Partitioning 101 will make an introduction to table partitioning through the GUI and a code based approach.  The session will be a discussion about how to make it work and will include: creating partitioned tables, partition schemes, left vs. right facing partition functions and how to do a basic switch operation.  A small deep dive about how to find out which partition your data is in and what exactly does it mean for an index to be “aligned” will also be discussed.
