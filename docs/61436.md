## Title: Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo-heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn why top down design is not always the best pattern as well as why implicit conversions can slow down your queries. You’ll learn how to rewrite most cursors as well as finding out how user defined functions affect performance. You’ll learn some simple ways to troubleshoot these types of issues using execution plans and extended events. Finally, we’ll take a look at how standards can help quicken turnaround time when refactoring T-SQL. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.
