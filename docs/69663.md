## Title: Security via policies
## Abstract:
### Based on my experience in Swiss banks, I propose a simple way to control security through policies.
Which types of control should be set up at instance and database levels?
How to manage multiple servers?
And finally, generate beautiful reports and send feedback emails.
We will try to answer all these questions we have during security audits...
