## Title: Database Security in SQL Server 2016 and beyond
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review the new enhancements to SQL Server security available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB, including Always Encrypted, Row-Level Security, and Dynamic Data Masking, as well as whatever else Microsoft has released since this abstract was written. We'll look at how to set these features up, how to use them, and most importantly, when to use them.
