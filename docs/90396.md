## Title: DevOps  Database Obfuscation
## Abstract:
### Database masking, obfuscation, CI, CD... What is this stuff?  This is a story about how we did a complete overhaul on our development life cycle to create more outcomes for our users, resolve communication issues with the team, and provide pre-production databases for our developers through database obfuscation.  We will discuss our why, our team structure, the preparation work completed, the database obfuscation process  tools available.
