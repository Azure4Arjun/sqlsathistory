## Title: Better Decision Making with Power BI
## Abstract:
### For most organizations, business intelligence means requesting reports from IT. The IT people then go into the company’s databases to find the requested information and deliver it. If the decision-makers want the data displayed in a certain way, they have to specify it in their requests—or, as often as not, they have to return to the IT office to make another request when they realize they need the data presented differently. But Power BI is what’s called self-service business intelligence. That means for most purposes non-technical users will be able to crunch the numbers without any help from IT. And switching to different graphics and displays is so easy the main difficulty is deciding which one to use.
