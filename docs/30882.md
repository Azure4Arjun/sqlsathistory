## Title: Auditing User Activity 101 
## Abstract:
### Auditing user activity in SQL Server has become a hot topic lately. From SOX and PCI to HIPPA, the security of personal data, and the ability to track who accessed the data and how has become extremely important. In this session, SQL Server MVP Jonathan Kehayias covers the various methods available in SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008 to accomplish this task including SQL Trace in SQL Server 2000 and 2005, and the new Server Audits in SQL Server 2008.
