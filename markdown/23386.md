## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: DBA Repository Update Using SSIS and SSRS
## Abstract:
### At its heart, the DBA Repository solution employs SSIS and SSRS to centralize important SQL Server information for the DBA to analyze with ad hoc queries or reports. It was recently updated for performance and resiliency. This session will cover the original solution, published in SQL Server Magazine and his book SQL Server Tacklebox, plus the latest enhancements which will delve into some interesting uses of package variables and MERGE in SSIS. Rodney will also show you how to use the fundamental package contructs so that you can easily expand the freely available project in your own environment. Two additional packages will be demonstrated, Error Log gathering and SSRS audit logs.
