## Title: MongoDB for the Relational DBA
## Abstract:
### NoSQL is the buzzword of the moment, and MongoDB is the leader of the pack. Its probably running in your enterprise in production, and eventually its going to break. As a DBA its your job to fix it when it breaks, and back it up before it does.After all, there's not RELATIONAL in DBA.

On the technical side, this talk will focus on what a DBA needs to know about running MongoDB on windows. This includes setting it up as a service, importing and querying data, and of course backing up and restoring the database.

On the non-technical side, this talk will focus on when you would want to use MongoDB, and when you would not want to.
