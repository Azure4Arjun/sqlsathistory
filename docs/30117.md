## Title: SSIS 2008 - Profiling Your Data
## Abstract:
### Many data integration and ETL projects run over budget and past deadlines because the quality of the data was not known prior to the proposal. This session will attempt to show the users how to get to know their data better through an in depth look at the new data profiling task as well as the data profile viewer in SSIS 2008.
