## Title: Get your database under version control
## Abstract:
### It's a given that the source code to your project's ETL, Cubes, User Interfaces, WCF services, etc are kept under tight version control. But many developers turn a blind eye to source code in their database - the critical views, stored procedures, and user defined functions.

With a few concepts and tools build into every version of SQL Server I'll show how to build simple and free version control for your project.
