## Title: SQL Server 2014 for Hybrid Cloud 
## Abstract:
### The cloud is here and Hybrid cloud can help you get started and move forward! Cloud computing brings a new paradigm shift in computing and organizations continue to realize the potential cost benefits of running their database applications in the cloud with greater scale and flexibility.  Take almost any application scenario, from the largest public websites to small departmental applications, and you will find the vast majority of organizations look to take advantage of cloud computing, the availability of cloud-enabled database systems will be critical to their success. This session looks at the Microsoft vision of relational database management systems in the context of cloud computing. It is a hybrid IT vision that gains leverage from the industry-standard Microsoft SQL Server technology set and makes it available across the spectrum of deployment approaches organizations can take today.
