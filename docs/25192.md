## Title: The Future of the DBA
## Abstract:
### What will the DBA role look like in 10 years? 20 years?  Will a DBA still be necessary?  We'll explore a number of scenarios in an forum as we try6 to determine how, as DBAs, we can position ourselves for a bright and productive future.  I'll talk about trends I'm seeing in companies of all shapes and sizes.  This presentation isn't about concensus, but about tackling tough issues facing the future of our profession.
