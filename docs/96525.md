## Title: Azure Databricks: A Beginner's Journey
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about Azure Databricks but are not sure about how to or even if you should incorporate it into your existing ETL/ELT processs?  This session will serve as a brief walkthrough of Azure Databricks from a beginner's perspective, with a focus on how you can use it today with existing skillsets such as SQL.  Once we have an idea of the basics, we will use Azure Data Factory operationalize a Databricks Notebook.

By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of Azure Databricks and how you might take advantage of this new PaaS Big Data offering.
