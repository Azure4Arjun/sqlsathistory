## Title: Using object dependencies to develop smart solutions
## Abstract:
### Imagine you could track down all dependencies between database and related objects. For example: From a KPI in a SSAS Tabular model to a Measure to a Calculated Column, ..., to Data Source View, To Database objects in a Data Warehouse and via a stored procedure or SSIS package to a Staging database or even to the queries into or exports from your source production systems.

Then you could:
- Automatically document your BI or database solution;
- You could prove your data lineage;
- You could generate a deployment script given the SSRS Report, SQL View or Tabular database your users are waiting for to get into production.

But why use your imagination? Just come to see how I did it. I will demo it!
This session is a mix of SQL and SSAS DMV's, T-SQL data models, build tools and some Powershell glue. My goal is to inspire you!
