## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Effortless Backups with Minion Backup
## Abstract:
### Let's take the new, free backup tool out for a spin. We can hop through a quick installation, glance at the multi-install PowerShell script, and dance around the table-based schedules, for a start. Afterward we'll have a long, leisurely walk through some of the best things you can do with MB: backup ordering, pre- and postcode, live insight, striping and mirroring, and of course so much more. Feel free to download MB and follow along on your own laptop!
