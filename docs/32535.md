## Title: From Zero to BI in 10 Minutes
## Abstract:
### Finally a technology that the Information Worker can use to take raw data and turn it into valuable information in a matter of minutes from the comfort of their own desktop! In this very exciting and interactive session full of exciting demos, we will walk you through taking raw information from a variety of sources and building a powerful analytical model that can then be used for deep analysis and reporting. We will further see how this set of technologies revolving around the Office 2010 platform and SQL Server 2008 R2 will transform the way information workers will become self-sufficient with their ad-hoc BI and reporting needs.
