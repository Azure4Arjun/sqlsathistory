## Speaker: Cindy Chapman
## Title: Harassment| Bystander's Guide to Action
## Abstract:
### Have you ever encountered harassment at work? Me, too.
In your workplace, what would you do if someone was choking?  If their clothes were on fire?  Statistically, you are far more likely to witness harassment. Do you know what to do?
Bystanders have unique power to resolve harassment and restore respect in the workplace. Uncertainty is the biggest reason Bystanders don't take action. Vagueness about what action to take, and when. Indecision about when and what action is warranted. Even doubt about the role Bystanders should play.
In this session you will:
* Bystander will cultivate an awareness about workplace harassment.
* Bystander will learn to employ to observations and interpretation of cues and clues  to workplace harassment.
* Bystander will apply measured steps to develop a plan of action/response  in the face of workplace harassment.
* Bystander will confidently take action using moral courage and candid  conversation to restore respect and resolve workplace harassment.
