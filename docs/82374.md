## Title: Mastering Temporary Objects
## Abstract:
### More and more Transact-SQL code is using temporary tables and table variables constructs. These constructs leverage the tempdb system database, which in turn becomes a severe performance bottleneck. This will be particularly "felt" when moving on-premise database solutions into the cloud. In this session we will cover the best practices in how you should be implementing these temporary constructs in your database solutions. We will discuss the differences between temporary tables and table variables, their impact on query performance and tempdb before looking a different implementations and best practices. We will examine a variety of techniques to improve temporary object performance, from hardware to the database engine configuration. Finally we will cover a number of key, proven techniques that can improve substantially performance. With lots of examples and case studies we will show how you can improve query performance by 20x or more.
