## Speaker: Chuck Lathrope
## Title: Replication Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### This session is for users who want to improve their throughput using Replication Profiles and Server/Networking tweaks. I will also cover custom monitoring stored procedures that don't require you to keep replication monitor on all the time. Last item covered are some queries you can use to see replication errors and common solutions to them. It is expected that you know how to setup replication. Session will be focused towards SQL 2005/08 and transactional replication. But can apply towards SQL 2000 and merge replication.
