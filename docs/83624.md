## Speaker: Thomas Grohser
## Title: Shaving off Microseconds
## Abstract:
### This session is a compilation of extreme techniques I had to use over time to make very fast operations go a bit faster. It will cover multiple areas (indexing, table design, data access layer, schemas, object naming, datatypes, collations physical data placement and more. All examples given in this session are from real world cases of some of the most demaning workloads in the world.
