## Title: Query Plans and Indexes in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Data access can be easy to set up in your applications with wizards and ORMs, but sometimes your queries are just not as fast as you think they should be â€“ especially on those tables that are getting bigger and bigger. In this session, we will take a peek under the hood and see how SQL server answers the questions you ask of it. This is an introductory session, but it will be jam-packed with demos and useful tips that you will be able to use to make your applications more responsive.
