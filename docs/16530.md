## Title: Power View from the Data Visualisation Perspective
## Abstract:
### Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool. Where does it get it right, and where does it get it wrong? Using demos, we learn about Power View whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will:

- investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles
- look at the features of Power View
- look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack

Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.
