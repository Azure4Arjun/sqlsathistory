## Title: Analyzing the impact of weather on English Premier League matches in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered if there are more goals scored on a rainy day? This session shows how you can use open data sources and web pages to gather data. How you can then manipulate and extend it and finally report on it. We will look into how you can use data from open sources and combine it with data from web pages to create the dataset you need.  
When we have our dataset we will manipulate and extend it using M and DAX so that we can get meaningful insights from it. We will then dive into the data to see if there is anything to report.  

In this end to end Power BI Desktop demo we will use fun data that many can relate to as the English Premier League is one of the most popular football leagues in the world. The audience will take away many nuggets of information as they see how a real world example could look like. I will share all the obstacles and learning I got when creating this report reveiling both the limitation of Power BI Desktop and open data as well as its strength.
