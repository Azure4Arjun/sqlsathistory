## Title: Using Failover Clusters for High Availability
## Abstract:
### As DBAs, we know that AlwaysOn AGs and Failover Cluster Instances are built on the foundation of Windows Server Failover Clustering and that HA is their goal, but have you ever seen it work? Are they a good solution for your org? Do you know if your SysAdmins can do their part? Weâ€™ll discuss these points and more, diving in under the hood of WSFC in demos and showing a few scripts to make support and troubleshooting a little easier.
