## Speaker: Robert Verell
## Title: Know Your Role(s)!
## Abstract:
### Developers and DBAs naturally conflict with each other over permissions since developers want to be able to fix their code and research issues, but DBAs are the gatekeepers.  In this session we will discuss Microsoft recommended best practices for setting up users and service account permissions.  We will go over common server and database roles and what they actually allow, including roles that should be avoided as potential security loopholes.  He will also look into alternatives for elevated database roles, and easier ways of setting up users across an enterprise environment, all as part of how to consolidate your development servers into fewer instances.  Serves as an introduction to default roles, explicit permissions, schemas, and security challenges for consolidated environments or database as a service.
