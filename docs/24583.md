## Title: Tools to Make Multi-Object Administration Easier
## Abstract:
### Are you a DBA?  Do you have more than one instance?  An instance with more than one database?  A database with more than one object?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, join me to learn to administer multiple instances, databases and objects from a single query or script.  Topics covered will include Central Management Server, loops with dynamic SQL and sqlcmd.
