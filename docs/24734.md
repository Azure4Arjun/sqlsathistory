## Title: Understanding BI Security Best Practices 
## Abstract:
### How secure is your BI environment? The Microsoft Business Intelligence stack contains multiple tools which each have different security configuration options and interdependencies. This session starts with a review of the security architecture of each component in the BI stack and highlights vulnerabilities in the architecture that must be addressed to properly secure your BI environment. 

In this session, you'll also learn about the relationship across the security settings in the BI tools, backend databases, and the Windows operating system. Building on this foundation, you'll learn what steps are necessary to apply security best practices in each component of the Microsoft BI stack.
