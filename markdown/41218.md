## Title: Window Functions in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Recent versions of SQL Server brings with it nearly full ANSI compliance with the window functions. Come to this code filled session to learn about all of the window functions in SQL Server 2012: Ranking functions, changes for windowing in the Aggregate functions and the new Analytic functions. We’ll examine how this latest implementation of the window functions allows us to perform running and sliding aggregations; retrieve data from adjacent rows in the partition, and much more – all without expensive self-joins or Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) back to the source table.
