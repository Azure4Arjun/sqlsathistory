## Title: Don't Get Lost in Translation: Multilingual Reporting in SSRS
## Abstract:
### Today's modern global business environment necessitates information being available in the end user's native language. In the past this challenge has been met in a variety of ways with mixed results. Often companies maintain multiple sets of reports and data per language or implement solutions which perform poorly and are difficult to manage. The solution presented here is scalable,  easily managed and performs better than commonly used solutions.
This session will highlight how to create a pivoted dataset for the translated text, use native SSRS functions and change translations based on the user's browser locale information. At the end of this session you will have a dynamic and robust method to handle multiple languages for reporting.
