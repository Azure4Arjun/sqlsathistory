# Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-395)
Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Ben Galluzzo
## Title: Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTE) are a temporary result set used within an SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, that can be used in place of a subquery and can help simplify more complex queries such as when joining to the same result set multiple times.

We'll begin with an overview of how a Common Table Expression is constructed.  Then we'll build some queries using derived tables, and as the queries we build get more unwieldy, demonstrate how the query can be simplified by the use of a CTE.

# Automating Your SSIS Design Pattern for Faster Development
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-395)
Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI 3
## Speaker: Samuel Vanga
## Title: Automating Your SSIS Design Pattern for Faster Development
## Abstract:
### Once you finish designing the SSIS packages needed for your project, the process of creating those packages is mostly redundant and time-consuming. As the source or target systems go through changes (even as small as a column rename), you’re forced to modify the packages.

BI Markup Language (BIML), which is a free plugin, removes the pain-points involved in manual development by programmatically generating packages. In this session, you’ll learn the basics of BIML and see how you can use it along with metadata to create packages automatically. You’ll also see how easy it is to regenerate the packages when the system changes. You’ll leave the session with knowledge of BIML’s building blocks and a principle I call “D[ee]MOB” that helps you automate SSIS development in your environment.

# Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-395)
Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jamie Wick
## Title: Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Using the SQL setup wizard and management studio (SSMS) to install and configure a new SQL server is a time-intensive process.  PowerShell scripts can greatly reduce the time required to complete the process.  They can also ensure build standardization throughout your SQL environment.  In this session we will look at PowerShell scripting, including the basic syntax and commandlets needed to automate the installation and post-install configuration of a SQL Server.

# Introduction to Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-395)
Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI 3
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Introduction to Biml
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

# Normalize because you need it
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-395)
Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: DEV
## Speaker: Raj More
## Title: Normalize because you need it
## Abstract:
### When you design a Transactional System, learn to make decisions on what to normalize based on business rules, not just on the basis of the 1NF through 6NF (nothing wrong with the rules, but I do encourage that you understand your data as well as the rules).

For example, do you need to which of the two addresses and order was shipped to? Which credit card out of the three that you have on file was used on the 106th order for this customer?

My talk is based on breaking out a different table because you need to keep track of the data - when, as a part of your design or maintenance, it dawns on you that this particular piece of data is relevant to the present, and to past events, and needs to be kept track of.

I back my suggestions with experience from designing Transactional Database Systems with 600+ tables used to keep track of multiple threads of information, passing relevant information on to efficient reporting structures.

Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 15:20:00 - Track: BI 3
## Speaker: Philip Noakes
## Title: ETL Design - Staging
## Abstract:
### The staging area of the data warehouse is an often under-utilized tool in the ETL developers tool belt.  It can be used to optimize ETL performance while limiting impact on source systems.  It can be used to identify data quality concerns before they hit the target load process.  It can be used as a supplemental repository for unintegrated data.  This discussion will cover several common and some not-so-common patterns in the design and use of the stage environment within the ETL process.  The audience will come away with new ideas and core concepts to put to immediate use.
