## Title: Get your data flowing with Data Flows! and...umm...dataflows
## Abstract:
### Microsoft recently launched Data Flows in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to move the service beyond the pure orchestration space into the world of extract, transform and load (ETL). At roughly the same time, Microsoft also introduced dataflows into the Power BI service world, allowing users to leverage common query models across an enterprise. So, what do we do with these new offerings? What are they, really? Is Microsoft just trying to confuse us? This session untangles and explores ADF Data Flows and Power BI dataflows to help you to get a better understanding of how you may be able to apply them in your world.
