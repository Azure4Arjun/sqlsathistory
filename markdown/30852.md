## Title: LINQ Kinq for the DBA Guy
## Abstract:
### With the release of .NET 3.5 and the subsequent SP1, attention has focused upon the legitimacy of Object Relational Mapping systems. Regardless of whether you embrace LINQ to SQL, the Entity Framework, NHibernate, or any of the hundreds of other O/R Mappers, the question remains for the DBA: Is it time to consider alternatives to stored procedures? In this session, we'll introduce LINQ and discuss how programmers and DBA's can work together with these emerging technologies to build robust, performant and dynamic systems.
