## Speaker: Christopher Adkin
## Title: SQL Server Batch Mode and CPU Architectures
## Abstract:
### This session starts out with a demo which defies conventional wisdom, the purpose of this being to provide a 'Hook' into how CPUs are designed, how they work and how batch mode leverages modern CPU architectures. The concept of batch mode back pressure will be explored along with the pressure points batch mode places on modern CPUs and where the next quantum leap in performance might come from.
