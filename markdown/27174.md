## Title: SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse Appliance
## Abstract:
### PDW is a massively parallel processing data warehousing appliance built for any volume of relational data (with up to 100x performance gains) and provides the simplest integration to Hadoop.

SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse introduces PolyBase, a fundamental breakthrough in data processing used to enable seamless integration between traditional data warehouses and “Big Data” deployments.

-       Use standard SQL queries (instead of MapReduce) to access and join Hadoop data with relational data.

-       Query Hadoop data without IT having to pre-load data first into the warehouse.

-       Native Microsoft BI Integration allowing analysis of relational and non-relational data with familiar tools like Excel.

Scale and perform beyond your traditional SQL Server deployment with PDW’s massively parallel processing (MPP) appliance that can handle the extremes of your largest mission critical requirements of performance and scale.
