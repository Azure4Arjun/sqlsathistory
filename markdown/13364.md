## Title: Using Mahout  R to Turn Text into Measurable Value
## Abstract:
### Regardless of what business we are in, we are generating large volumes of data.  Most of this data is unstructured.  Valuable information exists in unstructured data. The challenge is how do we find this information, and perhaps even more importantly; draw meaningful correlations with structured data. Mahout and R allow us to find patterns in unstructured data and correlate text and numbers.
