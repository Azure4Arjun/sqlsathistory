## Title: Advanced Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### We will cover several advanced topics in Transactional Replication including how to make a ddl change to one table in the publication without reinitializing the publication; how to make a ddl change to a table without having to snapshot; creating replicated tables on file systems other than Primary – including partitioned file systems.  And hint – we will be leaving the wizard in Redmond!!  Bring a copy of SQL 2012 Developers Edition with AdventureWorks2012 if you want to play along.
