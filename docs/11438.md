## Title: Implementing Contained Databases
## Abstract:
### Contained Databases is a new feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. We will take a look at the security implications of contained databases and why it considered only “partially” contained. This technical dive into the feature will demonstrate how to implement contained databases, how to migrate a contained database, and
what “gotchas” to be aware of.
