## Title: SQL Server Deployment Options
## Abstract:
### Today companies are looking for options related to the deployment of their database workloads. Some database servers may need to be installed on-premise because of regulatory or performance reasons. For other scenarios, it may make more sense to deploy these databases in virtual-machines hosted in the cloud. Finally, newer applications may be better suited for Platform as a Service (PaaS) architectures.

Indistinctively of which deployment model makes sense for you, it is extremely important to have a consistent user experience when managing, monitoring and developing for these databases. Learn about how you start today to take advantage of SQL Server deployment options.
