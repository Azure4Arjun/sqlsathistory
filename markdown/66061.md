## Title: Agile Data Modeling with Data Vault
## Abstract:
### Agility and Business Intelligence are two good things that often struggle to be good together. A primary cause of this struggle is the inability of traditional Data Warehouse models to respond to change in a (business) timely manner. Data Vault is an evolution of Enterprise Data Warehouse modeling that removes the barriers to Data Warehouse agility. A Data Vault warehouse eliminates re-engineering both of the data schema and ETL as the model evolves in response to changing business needs and definitions.
In this session weâ€™ll compare modeling techniques in real world scenarios to understand how Data Vault can make your EDW more capable and agile.
