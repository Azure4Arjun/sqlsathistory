## Title: Best Practices for Database Deployment
## Abstract:
### The easiest part of any deployment is running the deployment script on production. But what have you done to prepare that script for production? Was the script tested? Is the script tightly coupled with the application code? The difference between a successful deployment and a failed or problematic deployment is all the preparation work you've done to ensure that you're deploying the right script, the right way to your production environment. This session will explore best practices that you can implement to ensure that your deployments are as successful as they can be.
