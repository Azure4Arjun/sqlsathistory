## Title: Storage Testing for Database Professionals
## Abstract:
### More and more Database Professionals are tasked with performing testing and validation of storage devices and surrounding infrastructure to be used for database workloads they support. In this session we will give you all the tools you need to be effective at performing such testing and validation. We will argue pros and cons of synthetic testing. Tools like DiskSpd and VDBench will be discussed, along with SQL Server-specific tools to test real workloads like Distributed Replay and RML utilities. Links to tools and pre-packaged scripts will be provided.
