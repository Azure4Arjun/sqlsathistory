## Title: Stress Inoculation: Maintaining Performance Under Pressure
## Abstract:
### Stress is a natural reaction to demanding events for which our natural resources to cope or react are low. Initial effects might be increased energy and focus but can quickly give way to inaction and costly mistakes. 

This course presents a variety of simple yet highly actionable techniques borrowed from some of the most stressful fields on earth. In this course, you learn to apply the same methods that doctors, military, law enforcement, and paramedics learn to cope and perform under high-stress situations. Discover how easily these techniques translate to almost any career or endeavor.  

Whether you regularly support a multi-million dollar data center on a 24-hour on-call rotation or are asked to restore production while three levels of management look over your shoulder, counting the dollars lost per minute, everyone is susceptible to stress. Some people just have a higher immunity. Attend this inoculation session and get caught up on your boosters.
