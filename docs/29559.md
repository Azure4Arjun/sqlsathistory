## Title: Virtualizing your SQL Server Environments
## Abstract:
### If you are a DBA, and you are hearing from your management team "Everything else is being virtualized, when can we virtualize your SQL Servers?", then you need to come to this session. In it we will discuss the concepts required to properly virtualize SQL Server. You can take control and lead the virtualization conversation by building a fact based plan for when to virtualize, and when to go with a physical infrastructure. You need ammunition and hard evidence to push the server and virtualization teams to consider your SQL Server environments in a different light. What metrics are important for you to capture before go live, and what metrics you must monitor proactively for success.
