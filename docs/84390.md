## Title: How to Realize  Quantify Value from Data
## Abstract:
### As we transition from the information age to the age of insights, data practitioners face the challenge of justifying investment of time, resources, and capital in data initiatives.  Data and analytics professionals are increasingly being asked to practice what we preach as data storytellers and answer, what value does my data have?

We will discuss how to create business cases, value statements and return on investment for data projects and programs.  We will address the approach to calculating and communicating value throughout the entire project life cycle from conception to execution to evolution with special consideration to each part of the data ecosystem including data governance, data management, data visualization, and analytics.
