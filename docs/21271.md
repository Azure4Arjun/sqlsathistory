## Title: Data Quality Services in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### Based on the teaching of the Kimball Group and Jack Olsen, learn about what data quality is and how to manage it in a data warehouse project.  See how Data Quality Services (DQS) fits into the cleansing and conforming steps of an ETL and how these new tools create a huge leap forward in how the organization can take active responsibility over their data.  This session will give hands on examples of common data quality problems and how to address them.
