# SQLSaturday #340 - San Diego 2014
Event Date: 20-09-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track #1
## Speaker: Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Identity, Sequence and ROW_NUMBER
## Abstract:
### This session is about tools in T-SQL that allow you to generate a sequence of values, often used as surrogate keys, but sometimes for other purposes. The session covers the identity column property and the limitations it imposes. It covers the sequence object which was added in SQL Server 2012. It compares and contrasts the sequence object with the identity property, including a performance comparison. If time permits, the session will also discuss generating sequences of integers with the ROW_NUMBER function, and describe some creative ways to use it.
