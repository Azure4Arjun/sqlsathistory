## Title: Building a Modern Data Warehouse in Azure for Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a rapidly growing data presentation and analytics tool, capable of connecting directly to a variety of data sources. That doesn’t mean you don’t need a data warehouse. The good news is that the tools needed to build a modern data warehouse are readily available in the cloud.  
In this presentation, we’ll Use Azure services to extract, load, and transform transactional data using Azure Data Factory, Azure Functions, Azure SQL, and Azure Analysis Services to create an agile and scalable data warehouse consumable by Power BI.
