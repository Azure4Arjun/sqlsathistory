## Speaker: David Gonzalez
## Title: Big Data in Sports
## Abstract:
### Big Data has arrived within elite sports organizations.  Similar to what has been observed outside of the sports industry, the typical organization struggles to make sense of how it can take advantage of Big Data and more generally, Analytics.  In addition, similar to what researchers have found, top-performing organizations are gaining a disproportionate competitive advantage from their analytics projects relative to low-performing organizations.  Using examples from his Sports Analytics consulting experiences, Mike provide insights into the use of Big Data and Analytics in the sports industry.  In addition, he will present a framework that his clients use to increase the likelihood of success with their analytics programs.
