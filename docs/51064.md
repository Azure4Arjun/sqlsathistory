## Title: SQL Azure â€“ DTUs and Delta (with on-prem)
## Abstract:
### SQL Azure has been around for over five years, and is now ready for enterprise production workloads.  This session will address the two issues that Architects, DBAs and Developers want to know more about as they move production workloads to the Cloud.  

One topic is the mystery around DTUs (Database Transaction Units), the units that are used to indicate the relative performance levels of different tiers of SQL Azure.  The first part of this session will explain the concept of DTUs and how to choose which one as the starting point.

The other topic is the difference in features between SQL Azure and SQL Server.  Because of the fundamental multi-tenant nature of SQL Azure, there will always be differences between the two.  Over the years, these differences are being continuously reduced, and this session will explain the current delta.
