## Title: Intermediate R - Shiny, Working with SQL Server, and Docker
## Abstract:
### This session will go over more intermediate to advanced R concepts.  In this session, we'll look at connecting and working with SQL Server.  This includes offloading data processing to Microsoft R Services.  Along with that, we'll look at Shiny, and creating dashboard-like content in Shiny and how to deploy to a Shiny server.  We'll use Docker for everything in this presentation, from the creation of the R/Shiny projects, to using SQL Server.
