## Title: Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### The Adaptive Query Processing feature family was introduced in SQL Server 2017. With little to no changes, execution plans can take advantage of batch mode adaptive joins, batch mode memory grant feedback, and interleaved execution for multi-statement table valued functions. We will walk through demos of how the 3 features are implemented during query optimization. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how these features can help their own workloads and how to enable or disable them as needed.
