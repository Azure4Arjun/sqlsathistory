## Title: Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI [VIDEO]
## Abstract:
### Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? 

This session will introduce how to start the shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and how you can begin to leverage the power of machine learning in your business intelligence solutions. No previous knowledge of R or predictive modeling is required!

We will cover the basics and best practices of predictive modeling and then these concepts will be applied to create three different predictive models in R. Then we will cover three ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.
