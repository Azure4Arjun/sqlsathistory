## Title: Nested Set model for Hierachies in SQL 
## Abstract:
### A look at the basic Nested Sets versus Adjacency List models.  Why Nested sets model hierarchies and Adjacency List model trees.   This will stress the need for constraints to prevent cycles in either model.  The problems of hierarchical aggregation -- Nested Sets requires one set-oriented query and Adjacency List requires iterations or recursion.
