## Speaker: Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Data Security for the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Have you moved your application to the cloud? Are you thinking about it? Great! Now… how are you securing it?

Security becomes paramount when you move your data to the cloud - after all, it is a much more public resource than the corporate network you’re accustomed to using. Depending on the platform you choose, the vendor may take care of part of the security needs, but they don’t handle all of them. So what, exactly, is your responsibility? And where do you start?

Microsoft MVP Ed Leighton-Dick will answer these questions and more in this full-day workshop on how to best secure your data in the cloud. Topics will include the most common vulnerabilities your data will face on a cloud platform; differences between the current offerings on the major cloud platforms; and the implementation of technical necessities like authentication, encryption, connection security, and monitoring.
