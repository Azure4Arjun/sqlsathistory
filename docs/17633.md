## Title: StreamInsight in action: Monitoring website performance in real time
## Abstract:
### You may have heard of StreamInsight but what can it be used for? While there are a wide variety of use cases, we will look at one in particular ... how to monitor your website in real time with StreamInsight. In this session, we'll hook into the ASP.NET pipeline to send information to StreamInsight and integrate diagnostic information from Windows into a single dashboard of your website's performance as it is running. We'll see how StreamInsight can provide valuable analytics that allow you to gain valuable information ... not from web or event logs after the fact ... but while your site is running and you can respond to potential issues before they become visible to your users.
