## Title: Indexing for Optimal Performance
## Abstract:
### An Index can be the difference between your query returning in microseconds, seconds, minutes or hours!  That makes them an incredibly powerful and often misunderstood part of the data driven application performance.  In this session we'll review if you have the right indexes, or the wrong ones.  We'll look at the internals of how indexes become fragmented and explain why this can have such a severe impact on the performance of your application and what you can do to combat that.  
  You'll leave this session with a much better understanding of how your indexes work, and the knowledge and confidence to streamline your current Index optimization procedures to take your applications to new heights of performance.
