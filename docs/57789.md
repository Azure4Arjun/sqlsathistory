## Title: Power BI Governance and Enterprise-wide Deployment Options
## Abstract:
### Since release of Power BI many companies have started using it to leverage their data assets to profit from market opportunities. The ease of use and quick time-to-value were main elements to make Power BI a respected tool for every business from small to large enterprise. Many Business Users started using Power BI with minimum / no IT collaboration that started causing concerns especially within larger organisations. Now organisations have become increasingly aware of the need to put a governance and control process in place. 

In this presentation Iman will use his experience in implementing and rolling out Power BI for numerous organisations to share some tips and options for governance and deployment approaches at enterprise level.
