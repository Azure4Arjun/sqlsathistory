## Title: STOP! Consolidate and Listen!
## Abstract:
### In today's economic times, we are being asked to do more with less. Less budget, less hardware and yet our data needs keep growing! So how do we keep our database infrastructure humming along given these restrictions? In this session we will talk about different options of consolidation including: database-level consolidation, instance-level consolidation, and virtualization. Additionally we will also talk about some of the tools and methods you can use today to help you consolidate your SQL Server environment and do more with less!
