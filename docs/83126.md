## Title: Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners [EN]
## Abstract:
### Microsoft released SQL Azure more than eight years ago - that's enough time for testing. So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (aka production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for back up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually (sic!) restoring data. 

In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionalities, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure DB and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012/2014/2016/2017. We will look for topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.
