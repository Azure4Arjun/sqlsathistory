## Speaker: Davide Mauri
## Title: Back to the Roots: When indexes are not enough
## Abstract:
### If you want optimum performance in SQL Server, you have to use indexes. But what if you already implemented indexes and your solution is still slow or it doesn’t scale like you want? Or, if you're on Azure, it is just requiring too much resources, which in turns means just more money to be spent on it? You may have to rethink the way you write your queries. How you write your queries is directly related to how you approach and solve your business problems, and more often than not thinking outside the box is the way to unlock incredible performances. But what this exactly means in a database? And how a developer can do that? In this session, you’ll see how using some lateral thinking and a set-based approach will open up a whole world of possibilities. Thanks to this demo intensive session, you'll never be the same after switching on this new mindset!
