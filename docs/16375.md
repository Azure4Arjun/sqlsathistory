## Title: SQL Injections and How To Stop Them
## Abstract:
### SQL injections are a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement, through web page input. If left unprotected, SQL injections can cause havoc with web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, hoarding system resources, retrieving sensitive data, removing databases and database objects, or taking databases offline! This session will show how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and cover various prevention techniques and their effectiveness.
