## Title: Mission Possible: Pervasive BI
## Abstract:
### Making Business Intelligence pervasive throughout an organization has proven to be the “Holy Grail” for many companies – recognized as of immense value but also difficult to attain. In this session we will take a look at the definition, benefits, obstacles, and requirements of Pervasive BI, as well as techniques and technologies which have made SQL Server-based Pervasive BI a “Mission Possible” for many organizations. We will then take a look at a case study of a large internal corporate deployment of Pervasive BI built on SQL Server Analysis Services.
