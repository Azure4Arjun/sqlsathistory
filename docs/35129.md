## Title: Practical Table Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Table partitioning can be a very way to manage very large tables and their indexes. In this presentation, you will learn about the practical issues of table partitoning, including choosing range direction, schema file placement, sliding and revolving windows, and partitioned indexed views. Partitioning features of both SQL Server 2008 and 2005 will be covered, and typical usage of the partiton-related DMVs and DMFs illustrated.
