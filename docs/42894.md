## Title: Build an Activity-Based Costing System with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Get a sneak preview of my USA 2016 PASS Analytics Conference session - creating an Activity-Based Costing System with Power BI. Having the final report model in Power BI gives you the ultimate control over reporting, including adding other information possibly not even held with Information Technology.

We will use a real-world health care model to show how we replaced an expensive, difficult to understand and maintain SAS system, with a simple, elegant, and auditable solution based on the Microsoft stack. The rules are table-driven with allocated costs handling built in.
