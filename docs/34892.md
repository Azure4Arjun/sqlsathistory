## Title: Classification and Regression in Clojure
## Abstract:
### Starting with a set of data how can we go about importing, cleaning, understanding, and modeling a predictive system using the Clojure language and JVM platform libraries? We'll cover some of the topics relating to data transformation, feature extraction, cross-validation, and model reuse applied to a real world problem.  Though we'll be presenting examples in Clojure, many of the concepts and ideas can be applied to any platform or language.
