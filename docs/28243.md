## Title: Mobile Data Made Easy
## Abstract:
### Managing data on thousands of mobile devices isn't difficult with the right tools. As it turns out, SQL Server gives us everything we need to keep iOS, Windows and Android devices synchronized with a central data repository. In this highly-interactive session, we'll explore SQL Server's Change Tracking features in depth and write some application code that can be used on a variety of mobile platforms to perform simple, high-performance and robust data synchronization.
