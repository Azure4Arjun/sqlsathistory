## Title: 5 TSQL Commands I've Been Missing
## Abstract:
### Being a full-stack .NET developer, I have written my fair share of T-SQL, but not until I became an accidental DBA did I find a new world of T-SQL options available to me.   In this session, I will go over a five T-SQL commands available since SQL Server 2005 and up that I have been completely missing.  We will evaluate the usefulness of  CTE, OUTPUT, MERGE, APPLY, and RANKING FUNCTIONS and how each of these can replace common cases you see everyday.
