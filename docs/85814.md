## Title: Exporting and Synchronizing Data From SharePoint, Twitter and SalesForce into Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review how to leverage Enzo Data Pipelines to export and synchronize data from hosted data sources (SharePoint Online, Twitter and SalesForce) into a relational database in the cloud for software integration and reporting. As part of this presentation you will see how you can implement a Change Data Capture (CDC) architecture on top of SharePoint Online, Twitter and SalesForce, allowing you to trigger actions when source data changes in those systems.
