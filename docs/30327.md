## Speaker: Rob Farley
## Title: Deeper JOINs
## Abstract:
### There's so much more to know about joins than INNER, OUTER, CROSS. Understanding other kinds of joins, and the impact of decisions about how you write them can seriously impact your T-SQL effectiveness. A bunch of myths to dispel here too! No slides here - just demos. We'll create slides as we go.
