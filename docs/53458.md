## Title: SQL Server Debugging Made Easy using Extended Events
## Abstract:
### This is a demo filled session that will show you how to debug several common issues in SQL server database engine and identify hotspots as well failures using only extended events. We will showcase how extended events make scenario based troubleshooting easier without having to collect disparate sets of diagnostic data, gather memory dumps and comprise on performance. There have been a plethora of Extended Events which have been added to SQL Server recently based on customer feedback which deprecates the need to run profiler in many commonly encountered situations in production environments. This session covers the new enhancements and capabilities available for Extended Events.
