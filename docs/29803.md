## Title: A Single Sign-On BI Story: SAML Claims in SharePoi
## Abstract:
### SharePoint 2010 offers the elusive single sign-on solution to the Microsoft BI stack.  On the edge of new authorization schemes in the Enterprise, SharePoint 2010 offers a single sign-on solution via SAML Claim authentication.  In this session we will run through configuring SharePoint 2010 for SAML Claims authentication using ADFS 2.0 as an Identity Provider.  We will also demonstrate one solution for using Reporting Services 2008 R2 in this solution.
