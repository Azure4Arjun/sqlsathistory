## Title: Securing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn#39;t cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.
