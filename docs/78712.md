## Title: Create Custom Visual using JSON and R
## Abstract:
### Power BI visualization is a holistic visualization tool. You can draw most of the popular charts with it. However, there is always some needs for specific charts that may not be available in Power BI standard visualizations of the marketplace. There is a possibility to extend the visualization capabilities using R language. There are two ways to use R to extend the visualization possibilities. The approach was introduced in 2015 as “R” custom visual that you can draw chart by writing R scripts. The editor for writing R was not that was good and also the end-user able to see the R code behind the chart. The second approach for using R to have more chart in Power BI has been introduced in  2017 that is about creating Custom visual file (pbiviz file) using R and JASON language. In this seminar, I am going to show how you can create any custom visual by writing R codes. You able to create a custom visual that has a specific icon, name, and parameters.
