## Title: In-database Predictive Analytics with SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at SQL Server Machine Learning Services and, in particular, the new MicrosoftML package available in SQL Server 2017 and how it can be used to build an in-database Predictive Analytics Model, that can scale. 

The session will initially provide a primer to supervised Machine Learning before applying that to a real world scenario, taking you through each of the steps required to build an in-database predictive analytics model using R and SQL Server 2017.
