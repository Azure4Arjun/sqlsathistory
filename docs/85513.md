## Title: Finding The Droids Fast - Indexing For Padawan
## Abstract:
### You don't need to look in an entire planet to find two droids! You just need to find the right kubaz informant.
Indexes are the kubaz informants of database engines.
If you never heard of indexes or are afraid to use them, this session is for you!
We'll cover indexing basics, introduce all SQL Server 2016 indexing options and look at some typical optimisation scenarios.
Session suited for Developers, DBAs and Students (padawan level).
Disclaimer: This session might be a trap.
