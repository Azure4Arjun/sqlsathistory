## Title: Partitioning Design for Performance and Maintainab
## Abstract:
### Partitioning your data allows a whole host of benefits to the performance and maintainability of your databases but still seems to be a dark art known only to a few people.  With every release of SQL Server more features become available to help solve various problems and a lot of them require that your database has been partitioned for that feature to be used effectively.  The most recent feature requiring partitioning is Column Store indexes, without partitioning you would be required to drop them before modifying any data in the base table and then recreating them from scratch.
