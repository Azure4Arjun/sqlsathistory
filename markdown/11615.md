## Title: T-SQL Fundamentals: Logical Processing Order
## Abstract:
### “Column dbo.xyz' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.” Seen it; fixed it, but can we explain why we’re getting a syntax in the first place? The optimizer must follow a very specific hierarchy in order to generate a plan. When you understand the hierarchy, then you better understand the behavior of the optimizer.
 
This all-demo session will explain the logical processing hierarchy, giving you the foundation knowledge you need to build well-structured queries that keep the optimizer happy. Learn how the FROM clause is processed, why a calculated column’s alias can’t be addressed in the JOIN, why WHERE isn’t the only filter, and why NULL confuses everything. When you leave, you will think very differently about how you build your queries, and the query optimizer will love you for learning to speak its language.
