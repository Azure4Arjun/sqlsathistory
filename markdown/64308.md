### Enjoy lunch while learning about the next evolution of storage technologies!
 
In the past, islands of servers with local unevenly utilized and difficult to protect resources led to virtualization technologies like storage arrays (i.e. SAN's) to enable larger pooling of resources and advanced strategies in data protection and high availability.  While media technologies like SSD's have evolved from the rotational disk of the past, so has the array evolved into software defined storage strategies leveraging commodity hardware and providing almost limitless scale, face melting performance and new targets in availability.  Come learn how the storage market leader DellEMC views software defined storage and how it's product ScaleIO can help you evolve.
