## Title: Programming SMO for Fun and Profit!
## Abstract:
### Managing numerous SQL Servers can be very difficult.  Fortunately, Microsoft has provided a rich programmatic interface to allow DBAs to easily manage SQL Servers, databases, and objects.  Using SMO objects, a code-savvy DBA can automate otherwise tedious manual tasks: you can create and monitor backups and agent jobs, stop and start services, administer users and logins, and much more, on all of your SQL installations with ease.
