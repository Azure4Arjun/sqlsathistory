## Title: AzureML - A full journey
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll see Azure ML from the inside out. After a gentle approach on Machine Learning, we'll see the Microsoft offering in this field and all the feature it offers, creating a simple yet 100% complete Machine Learning solution. We'll start from something simple and then we'll also move to some more complex topics like the integration with R and Python, IPython Notebook until the Web Service publishing and usage, so that we can integrate the created ML solution with batch process or even use it in real time with LOB application. I predict that all of this sound cool to you, yeah? Well it is, since with ML you can really give that "something more" to your customers or employees that will help you to make the difference. Guaranteed at 98.75%!
