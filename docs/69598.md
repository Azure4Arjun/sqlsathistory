## Speaker: Andy Mallon
## Title: Interview with Rie Irish: Inside the Management Studio
## Abstract:
### Based on the award-winning interview television show Inside the Actors Studio, this session is an interview with a “SQLebrity” from the community. Interview subjects will share their path to success, discussing both their successes and their failures along the way. 
Host Andy Mallon persuades his interviewee (Rie Irish) to discuss personal experiences during his chats while discussing the highlights and lowlights of her career.

We will talk about Rie's childhood, how she got started in the business, her early career, and behind-the-scenes trivia. The interview concludes with the Proust Questionnaire, made famous by Bernard Pivot (Apostrophes) and James Lipton (Inside the Actors Studio). Attendees will also have an opportunity to ask their own questions.
