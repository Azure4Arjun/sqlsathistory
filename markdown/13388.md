## Title: SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour: Dead Reports Don't Talk
## Abstract:
### SABOTAGE? MURDER?

Before a pivotal meeting to secure venture capital, a key report vanishes from the server without a trace, leaving Cromulent Technologies' future in jeopardy. Our group must solve the crime. Time is critical as the CEO has promised to explain the matter to investors just sixty minutes from now. Only with your investigative skills, SQL Server knowledge, and teamwork can we find the missing report, bring the perpetrator to justice, and save Cromulent Technologies!

SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour is part technical presentation, part networking event. We'll focus on Reporting Services administration in areas that are vital to business continuity: security roles, encryption keys, and backups. All attendees have a part to play.
