## Speaker: Michelle Ufford
## Title: Index Internals for Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### Most DBA's have heard of indexes, but not everyone understands how they work.  In this in-depth session, Michelle will cover the internals of indexes, including index filtering and partitioning.  She'll compare the B-trees of different index types, explain fragmentation, and use undocumented commands to show you what an actual index page looks like.  Attendees will walk away with a much better understanding of indexes, which is helpful when designing and tuning databases.  If you've ever wondered just *what* goes on in an index, this is the session for you!
