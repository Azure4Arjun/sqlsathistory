## Title: Crack open the AMO for SSAS Tabular
## Abstract:
### Analysis Services Management Objects API is under utilised by many organisations (and not even heard of by some). In this session, I will walk through the features in AMO that help organisations build, customise, manage and administer SSAS tabular models using an automated and programmatic approach. The session will include demos to illustrate the capability of various AMO classes and methods. If you want to show off the length and breadth of programmatic features available in SSAS to your stakeholders, this session is your sure shot guide to being a glorified SSAS professional.
