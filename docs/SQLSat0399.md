# Performing a SQL Server Health Check
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#399-Sacramento-2015)
Event Date: 25-07-2015 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Database Administrator
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Performing a SQL Server Health Check
## Abstract:
### How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  If you say never, I'm not surprised - many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have many gaping holes.  It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that have too much!)

Come learn how to use freely available tools to check your servers for basic issues like backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy and indexing.  If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Are You Maintaining Your SQL Servers?
## Abstract:
### Are you performing all of the regular maintenance you should on your servers? Do you not run CHECKDB because "it takes too long"? How about Index Maintenance - does that take too long? Do you really have the appropriate backups in place?Do you have benchmark numbers in place to compare when your server is "slow"? Come discuss the answers to these and other questions - we will discuss the free Maintenance Solution scripted tools from Ola Hallengren and how they can help you fix these and other problems with a little easy coding you can do yourself. We will also discuss other tips and tricks to help you maintain and troubleshoot your SQL Server instances.

# Getting Started with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#399-Sacramento-2015)
Event Date: 25-07-2015 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Database Administrator
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) than Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

# Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#399-Sacramento-2015)
Event Date: 25-07-2015 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

# Best Practices for Excel Pivot Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#399-Sacramento-2015)
Event Date: 25-07-2015 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Tom Keller
## Title: Best Practices for Excel Pivot Tables
## Abstract:
### The benefit of a direct-connected pivot table for the SQL Admin/Developer is: you no longer have to write and constantly tweak reports! Just give your users permission to run a stored procedure, and they can satisfy all their reporting needs through self-service.

Benefits for your business user: they can always drill down to the detail, be confident that it was not changed after retrieval from the database, and change parameters and refresh whenever they want, even after rearranging the report.

It requires no client software besides Excel, and has worked similarly since Excel 97. Nothing is required on the server except any version of SQL. (You can also connect to any data source with an ODBC driver!)

Although the concept is straightforward, there are some stumbling blocks to avoid. I will cover all the important points for setting up this solution, including:
1) Making the Connection
2) Configuring and Arranging the Table
3) Allowing Users to Change Parameters

## Speaker: Jonathan Shaulis
## Title: Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis
## Abstract:
### Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response time performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.#160;

How SharePlex Replicates from Oracle to SQL Server and Eight Other Targets

Replicate from Oracle to a more economical and potentially easier-to-manage platform like SQL Server and experience less frustration when support is required. Offloading database activities to a SQL Server replica will leave more processing power and faster response times for your Oracle users. Users on the SQL Server target will enjoy near-real-time data on an instance that is tuned specifically for the purpose of reporting, analytics and other database activities while the Oracle production system remains tuned for online transaction processing (OLTP). In addition, SharePlex can be used to completely migrate an Oracle database to SQL Server without taking users offline during the migration process. A SQL Server target replica could be used to accomplish archiving or serve as a data warehouse

## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: Are You Optimistic About Concurrency?
## Abstract:
### What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012's SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic?  How can SQL Server 2014's In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency? 

In this session, we'll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having totally in-memory storage with no waiting!

# SQL Server Mythconceptions and Mythteries

Event Date: 25-07-2015 - Session time: 17:30:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: SQL Server Mythconceptions and Mythteries
## Abstract:
### There are a lot of misconceptions and mysteries in SQL Server due in large part to there be no single right answer for just about any question you have. How many times have you heard, ‘It Depends’ as the answer to a complex SQL Server question?  So often that it has almost become a joke.  When it’s your SQL Server, it’s no joke.

Why won't that query go parallel? Why won't the optimizer use that index? Why did rebuilding that index improve performance 10 times over?

Sometimes misconceptions become accepted as fact, and they spread. Occasionally, these mistold tales come from very reliable sources. It can be extremely difficult to tell what is fact and what is fable.

In this session, we will explore some of these misconceptions and mysteries turned myths and bust out the truth. We will prove the right answer and free you from these myths that have taken on a life of their own.

## Title: Techniques for Dynamic SSRS Reports
## Abstract:
### Do you need a navigation system within your reports? Do you suffer from report sprawl, having hundreds of reports written once and disappearing into the reporting services catalog never to be executed again? Would you like to see one report take the place of fifty?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then join me in this demo heavy session. Not only will we address the questions above, but we’ll talk about providing different layouts to the data in the same report, minimizing data based on the user’s credentials, and even techniques for colorizing various parts of a report using VBA code. These techniques will help make your reports user friendly and help you look like a reporting superhero.

## Title: Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions. We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes.
