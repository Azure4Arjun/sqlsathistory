## Title: Intro To Reporting Services Report Models
## Abstract:
### Report Models can be a great way to empower your end users to create their own reports through a drag and drop tool. This presentation will discuss how to create, maintain and secure SSRS Report Models. Although the focus is on implementation, we will use Report Builder 3.0 to demonstrate report model consumption. We will also cover some tips and tricks learned through real-world experience implementing and supporting report models for clients.
