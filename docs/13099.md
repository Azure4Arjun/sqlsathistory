## Title: Deadlock detected! All is lost or it's too early to sound the alarm? 
## Abstract:
### "Deadlock" is a terrible word, isn't it? Is it as scary as it sounds? Why do they occur and how can they affect an application? Significantly important question is how to solve "Deadlock" issues? The answers to these questions can be found in my session, which is completely dedicated to the fundamental principles of locking and isolation levels.
