## Title: AWSDynamo Lessons Learned:
## Abstract:
### Learn about how we are saving two orders-of-magnitude in cost implementing a global time-series datastore for devices in ad-hoc networks. Minimum requirements: receive 50 sensor values per device every minute and store them for 10 years. |- Objectives and rationale for selecting AWS |- Developing a data lifecycle and API (hot and cold) |- Projecting costs and ROI |- Datamodel (keystore anti-patterns): (a.) AWS' affinity for Availability over C  P. (b.) Avoid scans! write-time materialized views. (c.) Read/write-through caching: update-if-same consistency. (d.) Secondary indexes and CAP tradeoffs: AWSDynamo LSI vs. Cassandra and Riak, no silver bullet: cross-shard queries ("locals only"). (e.) Details about designing a smart hash strategy.
