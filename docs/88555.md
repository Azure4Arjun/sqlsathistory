Event Date: 31-08-2019 - Session time: 15:15:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration (Cloud/Hybrid/On-prem)
## Speaker: Ben Watt
## Title: An IoT/BI/AI session - from Raspberry Pi to Power BI and lots in between
## Abstract:
### In this session Ben will walk you through a home-made IoT project with the data ultimately landing in Power BI for visualisation. A Raspberry Pi is the IoT device, with sensors and camera attached to give an end-to-end streaming solution. 

You will see Python used to run the program and process the images. Microsoft Azure plays its part where Microsoft Cognitive Services enriches the images with facial attributes and recognition, Azure SQL stores the metadata, Azure Blob storage holds the images, Power BI visualises the activity and Microsoft Flow sends mobile notifications. You'll see enough to walk out and get your own project started straight away!

This is a demo heavy session and audience interaction is key!
