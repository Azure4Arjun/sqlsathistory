## Speaker: Kevin Goff
## Title: Absolute Introductory Session on SQL Server 2014 In-Memory Optimized Databases (Hekaton)
## Abstract:
### Hekaton is Microsoft’s code word for their new OLTP in-memory, optimized data processing option for frequently-used tables in SQL Server 2014. In certain instances, Hekaton can yield performance gains of over 10x. This session will cover the benefits of Hekaton, why developers and DBAs would want to use Hekaton, and the different options for creating Hekaton tables. We’ll also look at the native-code stored procedure optimizations when using Hekaton. Additionally, this session will show the range and limitations of Hekaton and how it differs from traditional SQL Server tables (such as transaction handling). Along the way, the session will have several code demonstrations where we’ll look at performance benchmarks. If you’ve heard about Hekaton and in-memory optimizations and terms such as ‘latch and lock free structures’ and wondered what it all means, this session is for you!
