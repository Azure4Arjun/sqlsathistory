## Title: Running SQL Server 2012 on Server Core: Why  How
## Abstract:
### Do you cringe every time "Patch Tuesday" rolls around?  Does the idea of applying 70-80% fewer Windows patches on your SQL Servers appeal to you?  Join us and learn about this and other benefits that can be achieved by running SQL Server 2012 (Denali) on the Core edition of Windows Server.  While Core edition has been used primarily for infrastructure servers like Domain Controllers and DNS servers, SQL Server 2012 now brings support for running the database engine.  This session will talk about when you may want to consider running SQL on Server Core and will guide you through the task of installing and configuring your server when you no longer have most of the Windows configuration tools that you may be used to.
