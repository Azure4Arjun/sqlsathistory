## Title: 15 Powerful SQL Server Dynamic Management Objects
## Abstract:
### The Dynamic Management Objects--a set of views and functions that first shipped with SQL Server 2005--are a window into the inner workings of your SQL Server instance. Locked within is the data you need to help solve virtually any performance problem, quickly debug issues, and gain insight into what's actually happening on your server, right now. This session is a fast-paced tour of the ins, outs, whys, hows, and even pitfalls of 15 of the most important views and functions--information gleaned from heavy use of the objects in a number of environments. You will learn how to understand transaction behavior, locking, wait statistics, sessions, requests, and much more. Attend this session and you will be the master of your SQL Server instance.
