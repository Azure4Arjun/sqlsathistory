## Title: Virtualize This!
## Abstract:
### With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital. With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen in minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments. In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments. Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.
