## Title: Modern Data Warehousing with Azure SQL DW
## Abstract:
### The principles of data warehousing, especially the work of Dr. Ralph Kimball, have been enormously successful for many years.
But are they still relevant to the world of data lakes and big data? And what is the role of a relational database, even massively parallel databases like Azure SQL DW or AWS Redshift? 

This presentation will explore these questions about when the concepts of DW are still relevant, and then cover some implementation details of a Modern DW on Azure SQL DW, including how to maximize performance by minimizing Data Movement (Shuffle Move and PartitionMove operations).
