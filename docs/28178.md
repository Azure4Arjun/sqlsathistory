## Title: Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts
## Abstract:
### "It's slow" are probably the 2 most dreaded words for any data professional...(right behind "You're fired!")...What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join me in this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session where we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your Analysis Services environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Attendees will walk away from this session with a plan that can be implemented next week to help avoid the pain of being caught off guard with Analysis Services performance issues and make troubleshooting a breeze.
