## Title: The Two Faces of SQL Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### MS SQL parameter sniffing (or "Bind Variable Peeking" in Oracle) is designed for good. 
Following some common best practices developers create procedures, analyze actual execution plan, test performance with various sets of data and it is then that they deploy. How about when the same good  procedure that used to run less than 100ms starts to timeout...in production? Then you may have become a victim of bad query plan due to parameter sniffing.
This may sound as a sci-fi scenario but is rather a real life use case which anyone may encounter. Join this session to get practical ideas of how to identify the cause, avoid typical mistakes and perform a fix.
