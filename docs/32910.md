## Title: SQL Server 2008 Resource Governor 
## Abstract:
### Working with limited resources in the hardware and software fields can be troubling for a DBA. Making things work smoothly when sharing servers among many applications can be a difficult and time consuming task. With SQL Server 2008 a new feature has been given to the DBA world that can make the process much easier. We will take a look at the resource governor from the ground up in this session and build a solution to alleviate some of the issues that come with sharing hardware.
