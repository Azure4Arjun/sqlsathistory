## Title: Responding to extended events in near real time
## Abstract:
### Extended events are really useful for gathering information not available otherwise. However, compared to other technologies such as trace and event notifications, it seems to be lacking a way to react to the events as soon as they happen. In this session we will see how this is possible using the APIs and which new possibilities this approach enables.
