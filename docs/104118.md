## Title: Hardware Hints For The SQL DBA - Don't Let Your IT Department Hand You A Big Bag Of Hurt
## Abstract:
### Most IT departments are stretched thin and do not usually have the opportunity to fully investigate the true needs of the database infrastructure.  In this session, we will cover a number of aspects that will help the SQL DBA have informed conversations with IT in order to ensure that better decisions are made when it comes to compute and storage hardware in order to deliver improved performance and reduced licensing cost.
This session will also cover some options that the DBA can investigate if they have been handed hardware that is not quite up to par.
