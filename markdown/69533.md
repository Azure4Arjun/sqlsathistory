## Title: Diagnosing SQL Amnesia: Where is Your Memory Going?
## Abstract:
### Memory problems in humans can be caused by injuries, traumatic events, or
physical deficiencies, and interestingly enough the same holds true for SQL
Server!  In this preconference seminar you'll learn about common patterns
and problems that affect SQL Server memory usage and how to solve them,
based on real world scenarios. From incorrectly-sized hardware for a
specific workload to code and schema design challenges that tax SQL Servers
memory usage, this seminar will give you the practical tools necessary to
tackle even the most challenging memory problems.
