## Title: Machine Learning - Best Practices and Vulnerabilities
## Abstract:
### It seems like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are a must nowdays.
For projects carrying a simple or well kown problem we can find a lot of ready-made solutions, but this extremne easy to use could be one of our best enemy when facing with specific custom problems.
With this session we will cover how to apply best practices in configurin ML but much more, do we reaaly need it always?
The second part will cover vulnerabilities of ML discovering how easy could be to fool a neural network by some techinques (Like pixel attack) and their implication in projects that requires no security issues.
