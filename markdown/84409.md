## Title: Keeping Data Science Simple in Azure Machine Learning Studio
## Abstract:
### As data science becomes a key buzzword that attracts many ears, people often try to overcomplicate the field of Data Science with fancy visualizations, algorithms and terminology. In its most basic form, data science can be broken down into three equal parts that consist of:
1.	Addressing a business problem
2.	 Understanding the data
3.	 Conducting and executing a “science” experiment.  

In this session we will walk through how to approach a data science problem in various phases using predictive analytics in Azure Machine Learning Studio.
