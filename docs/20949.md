## Title: Cloud Stakeholders - Top 10 Cloud Jobs 
## Abstract:
### Cloud computing is already a fact, which nobody doubts. Moreover, with cloud technologies, organizations can focus on their main activities. In the cloud each user has access to the highest quality services. Along with the various positive effects, vendors face a number of problems and undeveloped areas. Preparation of the stakeholders is crucial for each project. More or less the technologies are the same, but the way we use them is not the same in the cloud. Former flaws are today’s advantages, former fundamentals for developers are no longer available in the cloud. Are we ready to forget all that we know and start over again to learn and how sustainable is the new knowledge – these are the open questions that stakeholders raise today.
