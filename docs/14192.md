## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: What's In YOUR DB Wallet?
## Abstract:
### When you have one SQL Server instance to maintain, you can give that instance plenty of TLC.  When you have a hundred instances, many things which worked before simply will not scale, potentially leaving your databases in peril.  The next step (after justifiable panic) is to give yourself a force multiplier to help you keep your sanity on the job--specifically, an administrative database.  This session will give you an idea of what kinds of tools should go into an administrative database, as well as how to use this to collect important metrics for reporting and auditing.  Audience participation from more advanced database administrators is encouraged:  we want to find out what's in YOUR DB wallet.
