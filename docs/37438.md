## Title: Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server instance running at its peak performance level?  Probably not but the real question is do you know why not? Is your disk subsystem too slow or are you lacking enough CPU’s or is it something else? It is very easy to capture and analyze the file  wait statistical information that is automatically provided by the SQL Server instance with several key DMV’s so why not utilize them. We will see how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which area of SQL Server performance bottlenecks are doing you the most harm. This should be part of every DBA’s arsenal so come make it part of yours as well.
