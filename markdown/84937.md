## Title: Building Better Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### Do you need to start building Tabular models but don't know SSDT from SSMS? Have you looked at Azure Analysis Services but don't know where to start? Did your company just upgrade from SQL 2012 to SQL 2017, and you want to best leverage the new features?
In this demo heavy session we'll cover how to create a new Tabular model with a solid foundation to support happy users. In addition to step by step instructions and best practices on loading data, formatting your columns and measures, clean model design, and making the DBA's life easier when it's time to deploy, we will cover the two most important properties you can set to save yourself a headache.
