## Title: Cloud Data Warehousing: Azure SQL Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### The heart of almost all Business Intelligence solutions; Relational Data Warehouse, has been servicing us for decades making the implementation is complete and success. It was always an On-Premises database, but now it is available as a Database-as-a-Service with Microsoft Azure, called Azure SQL Data Warehouse. It is a MPP cloud-based, scale-out relational database that supports workloads from few hundred gigabytes to petabytes of data and it addresses all modern requirements in data warehousing. Let’s talk about traditional On-Premises data warehouse little bit and then discuss about Azure SQL Data Warehouse and implementation of it.

Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading  SQL Server (2000 to  2012),  SQL Server 2014 (with a good overview on 2016 too) by using best practices and available resources. 

What to-do and what not-to-do?

A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQL Saturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.

# Zombie Attack Against Clustered Indexes - Who really need them!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-646)
Event Date: 26-08-2017 - Session time: 11:15:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Uwe Ricken
## Title: Zombie Attack Against Clustered Indexes - Who really need them!
## Abstract:
### Clustered Index zombies come out of their graves to make the peace loving Heaps to one of them in your databases. Try to attack them or find a fair way to make them living together in peaceful harmony.

If you ask experts about using a clustered index you will in most cases hear the following statements: Yes, you need a narrow and contiguous clustered index for your table for good performance. Last but not least Microsoft Azure Databases requires clustered indexes but there might be situations when workloads and queries will suffer from wrong implemented clustered indexes.

Watch the demos which show in an impressive way that clustered indexes are not always the best choice. Build your clustered indexes wise or - as the demos will show - forgo for it for a better scaling. Become aware of the pros and cons of Clustered Indexes and make a wise decision when to use clustered indexes and the correct key attributes for it.

## Speaker: Tejas Shah
## Title: Improve data load speed and query performance with Columnstore indexes
## Abstract:
### Is data load performance into columnstore slowing you down? Should you drop nonclustered indexes before loading data? What batchsize should you choose? How should you handle large number of Updates/Deletes? Columnstore index can speed up the performance of analytics queries significantly but are you getting the best performance possible? Come to this session to learn the best practices and the techniques customers have used to load data in parallel with minimal or reduced logging into columnstore index. Specifically, we will cover data load using BCP, Bulk Insert, SSIS or MERGE command, concurrent trickle insert in IOT scenario as well as moving data from staging table. We will also talk about how to diagnose performance issues in queries accessing columnstore index and the steps you can take to troubleshoot.

# In memory OLTP  - what can it do for me?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-646)
Event Date: 26-08-2017 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Martin Catherall
## Title: In memory OLTP  - what can it do for me?
## Abstract:
### In Memory OLTP came along in SQL Server 2014 along with several limitations.
It was still really useful – as long as your use case suited the limitations.
SQL Server 2016 removes several of these limitations and widens the use cases of in-memory OLTP.
For example, even if you are not taking advantage of in-memory tables, you can probably leverage performance improvements by replacing traditional table variables and both local and global temporary tables with in memory implementations. Now you’ll be able to say that table variable is truly in memory!
Come along to this session and learn about some of features of in memory OLTP  - or Hekaton as a lot of people refer to this -  and how you may be able to leverage these high performance features in both new and existing applications.

## Speaker: Robert Blaas
## Title: Data Quality and the BI Life Cycle
## Abstract:
### In today’s high pressured business environments the need for agile BI has forced users to produce information at an ever increasing rate. The aspect of data quality is often overlooked as the need to bring out information at a more rapid pace forces people to cut corners. More often than not, data quality plays a back seat role until serious questions are raised regarding some of the information that is being published and as a result questions are asked about the reliability of the decision making process.This session will show business users how DQS can assist their business in identifying, resolving and managing data quality issues through a couple of clear and concise examples._The session will also show how the DQS engine can integrate with SSIS backend data warehousing package to assist in automating data quality issue resolution, again through clear and concise code examples.

## Speaker: Hamish Watson
## Title: DevOPs and the DBA
## Abstract:
### You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running production database the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipelin

## Speaker: Sarbjit Singh
## Title: Using Data for Digital Transformation
## Abstract:
### One of the main drivers for digital transformation reported in the survey was optimizing customer experiences and engagement. More than 60 percent of executives identified delivering a superior experience for customers and creating new sources of customer value as important factors in determining an organization’s success as a digital business. These goals aren’t just pipedreams either – organizations are backing this assertion with serious budgetary investment, with half of respondents planning to invest in building applications in the next year that support the customer engagement model.  So what role does data play in achieving these goals through a successful digital transformation? I will present details of the answer to this questions. I will cover how the data a company collects can be analyzed for insights that help the company personalize its interactions with customers. Data can be used to find trends around a customer’s habits, which is typically indicative of their future
