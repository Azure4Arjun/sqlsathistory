## Title: SQL Server 2008 - Practical Uses for New Features
## Abstract:
### When learning a new technology, I like to try to solve a real-world problem that will help me not only learn but also help me in my daily life.  Learning SQL Server 2008 was no exception for me.  Through the building of an electronic recipe box, I have taken advantage of many of the new features of SQL Server 2008 – including sparse columns, filestream, table-valued parameters, the MERGE statement and even spatial data.  Come learn from my experiences as we walk through the design and development of this application – and you can even have the code when we’re done!
