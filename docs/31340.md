## Title: Three cool packages in SSIS 2008
## Abstract:
### If you know the basics of SSIS, and/or you simply want to see some intermediate-advanced examples, this session is for you.  I'll spend about 20 minutes walking through 3 different SSIS packages that show tricks for using the data flow pipeline, scripting, multicast, aggregations, merge joins, package configurations, FTP, dynamic expressions, and even the dreaded Excel destination component.    These packages are based on a 2-part article of mine that was published in CoDe magazine this year.
