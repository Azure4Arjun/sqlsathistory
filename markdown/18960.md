## Title: Yesterday I Couldn’t Even Spell ‘DBA’.
## Abstract:
### Referred to as “DBA by Default” or “Reluctant DBA”, many people are faced with the situation of suddenly becoming a SQL Server database administrator.  Once the initial shock passes they realize that they need help. The abundance of SQL Server books and websites that exist, some good and some not so good, might only increase confusion leading to panic and rash decisions. DON’T PANIC! In this session we will cover ways to address basic problems and offer some suggestions for finding good places to find help.
