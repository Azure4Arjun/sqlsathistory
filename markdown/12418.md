## Title: Replication- A fresh look  peek behind the scenes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Replication is an often overlooked solution to a common problem - shared data. It is passed by as a solution of choice due to inaccurate misconceptions about complexity, performance, scalability and finally "fear" of the unknown. In this session we will take a fresh look at replication and how it can be used to benefit your organization. We will also take a look at what replication is doing behind the scenes, deal with some of the common misconceptions, and discuss solutions to some of the common problems that will allow DBA's to reconsider this SQL Server technology as a "center stage" solution.
