## Title: Parent/Child Structures in SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services provides the ability to nest packages within one another in a parent/child structure.  By creating a multilayer package infrastructure using native elements of SSIS, you can easily encapsulate reusable components of your ETL layer, simplify logging, and make the development process more efficient.

-- Sharing values between parent and child packages
-- Parent/child logging
