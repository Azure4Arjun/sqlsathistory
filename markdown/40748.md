## Title: Flash and SQL Serverâ€”Re-Visiting Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash.  Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability.
