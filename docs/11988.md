## Title: Introducing Microsoft Power Query
## Abstract:
### In this session, I will introduce the audience to Microsoft Power Query for Excel. Power Query is an Excel add-in that enhances the self-service Business Intelligence experience in Excel by simplifying data discovery and access. It has often been referred to as the end-user ETL tool, but I believe that it will also be a valuable tool for all technical staff. This demo rich presentation will expose many great features of one of the tools in Microsoftâ€™s Power BI tool belt.
