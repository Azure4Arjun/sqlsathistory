## Title: What's New in SQL Server "Denali"?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server "Denali" delivers many highly anticipated features that some feel are long overdue. In this session you will get a first-hand look at many of these new features relating to the engine (contained databases, AlwaysOn, and T-SQL enhancements), client tools (Management Studio, Books Online, and "Juneau"), and changes to setup and system requirements. You'll also learn about some of the features that will not be making it into Denali, and deprecated functionality that will stop working in this or the next release.
