## Speaker: Cherie Sheriff
## Title: Auditing and SQL Forensics in SQL Server 2008 (r2)
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered who made a change to your structures or data?  Do you need to find out who has permissions to do what in your system?  This session will take you on a tour of auditing for internal, SOX or HIPPA Compliance.  


How much of a summary do you need?  Or will this work?  I will go into some data forensics as well, but to keep it within the time limit, I will structure it to structural changes, not so much the data itself, though the same techniques apply.
