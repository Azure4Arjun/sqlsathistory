## Speaker: Meagan Longoria
## Title: Up Close and Personal with the Tabular SSAS DMVs
## Abstract:
### Did you know that we got new Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) for the SQL 2016 SSAS Tabular models that also work with Power BI? They can be used to monitor the health of your database as well as to retrieve useful metadata. In this session, you'll learn how to access and query SSAS DMVs as well as important data points found in the DMVs. Then I'll demonstrate my Tabular Model Documenter based upon the DMVs and explain how I built it. You'll walk away with a tool that automatically documents your tabular model, saving you from tedious manual documentation.
