## Title: Advanced Execution Plan Analysis
## Abstract:
### If you have been working with SQL Server for a while now, you probably already know the basics of reading execution plans.  You know what most of the common operators do, at least in outline, and you know some of the things to look out for and correct. Even so, you still encounter plans from time to time that contain mysterious elements, or which just do not make complete sense to you.

There is always more to know about query plans and the execution engine, but this session will help take your query analysis skills on to the next level. We will look at some of the less well-known operators and plan properties, then explore advanced plan sub-tree shapes and the T-SQL constructions they are most often associated with. Becoming familiar with these details will enable you to write T-SQL that targets a more optimal execution plan.
