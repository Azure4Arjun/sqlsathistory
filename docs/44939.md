## Title: Polybase in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### If you want to mix traditional relational data with semi-structured data stored on Azure or Hadoop, then the out-of-the-box Polybase functionality in SQL Server 2016 is one of the easiest ways to get started with this.

In this session we first introduce the Polybase architecture, then show how to setup and query Polybase. This demo-rich session helps both developers and DBAs in understanding the potential and practical use of Polybase.
