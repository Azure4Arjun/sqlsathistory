## Title: Polybase in SQL Server – Big Data Queried with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### BigData solutions cross our sight in more or less intense way during past couple of years. Various implementations of this technology generate another set of technical skills required when you invest in this field and they may become real road blocks in your projects. When companies work on large analytical solutions Microsoft says: “Stick with T-SQL only when you query Big Data”. You’ll see how efficient can SQL Server be when you retrieve information from less structured files and Hadoop. Plus, how can you mix it with relational databases. SQL Server married with Big Data – live in action!
