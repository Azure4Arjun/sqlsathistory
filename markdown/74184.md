## Title: Emergency! Are You Ready for Disaster to Strike?
## Abstract:
### Most of the time pilots are learning to fly, they're actually learning how to recover from emergency conditions. While we as Database Administrators focus on taking backups, how much time do we actually spend practicing recovering with those backups? This session will focus on the kinds of situations that can dramatically affect a data center, and how to use checklists to practice recovery processes to assure business continuity.
