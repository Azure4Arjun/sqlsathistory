## Title: 5 Resolutions to Build Your Professional "Brand"
## Abstract:
### The start of a new year offers us the opportunity to “take stock” of what may or may not be helping us to achieve our personal and professional goals. One thing we may forget to assess is our “professional brand”.  Your professional brand can help you to distinguish and position your personal portfolio of experience, skills and knowledge as unique and of value to customers and in the marketplace.  This session looks at five actions to take that align your professional brand with your career goals, and can help your clients, peers, and managers see the tangible and intangible benefits of working with you.
