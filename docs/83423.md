## Title: Power BI Report Design for the Aesthetically Challenged
## Abstract:
### So you're a BI developer, and you've worked hard to get a good knowledge of DAX. Your power BI model is working well, but you're not sure how to present it in a stylish, attractive and appealing way?

Many of us are not blessed with amazing artistic ability, and we find design work be a real challenge. Don't despair, there are some logical patterns and tips we can follow to make big differences in our reports without needing to unleash the artist within.

In this session we'll learn about layout, colour theory, design principles and how to choose the best visualisation for the message you wish to convey.

We'll also take a glance at enhancing our reports by the using bookmarks, tooltips and drillthrough features in Power BI.
