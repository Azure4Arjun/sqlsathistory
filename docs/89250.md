## Title: What's New in Creating Data Models and Reporting with Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI has grown into a very useful and powerful tool to analyze your corporate data, but not everyone knows that it is a product that is literally changing monthly.  Each month Microsoft introduces new features to the downloaded and online versions of PowerBI.  Keeping up can be time consuming.  However, Microsoft provides documentation, videos, and other resources to not only help you up to date with these changes, but to also allow you to vote on potential new features and even to submit new feature ideas of your own.  If you have not been keeping up with the changes to Power BI since you first downloaded your desktop version a year or more ago, you need to attend this session to learn how to keep up with this ever changing, ever improving product.
