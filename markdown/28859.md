## Title: User-Defined Aggregate Functions - Why and How
## Abstract:
### This session is all about SQL Server user-defined aggregate functions. We'll start with why you may want to use one even when alternative methods exist to get the same results. Then we'll walk through a simple yet useful example of creating an aggregate function, from start to finish. We'll create the .dll file in Visual Studio, enable the CLR in SSMS, import the aggregate and then put it to use. Along the way we'll cover some of the error messages you may receive, what they mean, and how to correct them. Come see what has been missing in your life without user-defined aggregate functions.
