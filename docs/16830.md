## Title: Add SSIS to the developer tool belt without adding to the DBAâ€™s work load Part 1 (for the DBA)
## Abstract:
### SSIS is a powerful tool for this but up until SQL 2012 it has been cumbersome in deployment and for security issues for both the developers and DBAs alike. How is SSIS 2012 different than past versions? This session will discuss the various SSIS deployment modes focusing on the new project deployment model. We will walk through several examples. Using a Hosted SSIS server and the project deployment model empowers the developer to view SSIS as self-service SQL feature and not chore to have to coordinate with the DBA.
