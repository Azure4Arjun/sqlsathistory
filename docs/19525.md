## Title: Now that’s what I call the worst dataviz – ever! 
## Abstract:
###         Information: We will discuss the worst data visualisations in the world - ever. Join in the fun and bring along the worst data visualisation you’ve ever seen. Come and see why certain visualisations are bad, and wonder why people ever thought that it was a good idea to display data like that!
