## Title: SSIS, You, and ETL Architecture
## Abstract:
### BOS30-200: SSIS, You , and Better ETLDid you already learned SSIS, and now want to get serious about ETL? Did you become an SSIS developer by accident, but wonder what makes a good ETL solution? Is your current SSIS solution falling apart and you need to revamp it? The Complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poor crafted solution would inevitable lead to maintenance nightmares, or worse yet to the failure of the whole project. In this session we will try to bridge SSIS and a ETL architecture based on good practices while looking to some lessons learned from real world implementations.
