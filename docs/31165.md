## Title: Visual Studio 2010 SQL 2008 Database Projects  
## Abstract:
### How many change scripts does it take to upgrade your database?  How do you keep those scripts in-synch from version to version?

I will be covering the new approach Microsoft has provided through the Visual Studio Database Project and how this can simplify development and deployment for the multiple environments in an enterprise.  I'll show you how to set up a database project and create a TFS build that automates the deployment to any target environment.
