## Title: Data Classification and Masking: the What and How of Data Protection
## Abstract:
### As organisations make greater use of their data assets across multiple systems and environments, there is an increased risk of exposing unmasked sensitive data. This is particularly a concern when regulations such as GDPR are also in play. 
 
However, copies of data used in dev/test or in analytics need to be an accurate representation of the primary data so omitting, or doing a simple replacement of sensitive values, may skew any results. 
 
This session will introduce tools and processes that can be used to help protect your data. It will firstly show how the Data Classification utility in SSMS and SQL Server can identify and categorize your sensitive data. We will then see how Data Masking can be used to either hide sensitive data from selected users or to completely replace specific classifications of data with new values that both protect the source and also ensure that the distribution of data values remains consistent for your test environments.
