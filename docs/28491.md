## Title: Fundamentals of SAN, NAS and IP Storage
## Abstract:
### SAN’s and NAS’s have their own challenges but also open up a whole new set of tools for disaster recovery and high availability. We will touch on the basics that can be applied to most SAN’s and talk about strategies for setting up your storage. We will also cover what makes up a Storage Area Network and what seperates Network Attached Storage from SAN's and how iSCSI fits into this picture.
