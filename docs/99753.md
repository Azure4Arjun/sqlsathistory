## Title: Code Like a Snake Charmer â€“ Advanced Data Modeling in Python!
## Abstract:
### Python is the one of the most popular programming languages used today and one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt, especially for machine learning. Python is integrated into the Microsoft stack in tools like Azure ML, Databricks, Azure Functions and SQL Server. 
 
This session will dive in-depth into proper data modeling and deployment using the Python language including:  
 
1.	Data extraction 
2.	Data cleaning 
3.	Data transformation 
4.	Data exploration and visualization 
5.	Predictive modeling 
6.	Model validation/testing 
7.	Deployment of the solution.  
 
Attend this session to learn how to use Python to conduct data analysis and modeling. We will use Python and packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and others to explore real-world datasets and build data models using proper techniques like feature engineering, splitting datasets into validation and training datasets, testing data models, interpretability of a machine learning (ML) models a
