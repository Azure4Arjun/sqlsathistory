## Title: Intro to Graph Databases
## Abstract:
### Recent years have seen an uptick in the adoption of alternative data storage methods.  While the traditional RDBMS is still the de-facto Swiss Army knife for backing applications, technologies such as NoSQL and time series databases are increasingly used due to their performance and usability characteristics in certain use cases.

One of the latest entrants on the scene is the graph database.  In this session we’ll discuss what they are and how they are used.  The introduction of graph database support in MSSQL 2017 provides us with a convenient mechanism for presenting our existing data through a graph.
