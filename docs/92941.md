## Title: From Datawarehouse, across BI, to modern data analysis and artificial intelligence, Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about Azure Databricks? The new kid in the Azure Big Data family? I would do wrong to call Azure Databricks as a managed Apache Spark service, as it is so much more.
In addition to transforming data, Databricks can also be used to analyze and stream data, run your ETL tasks, train Machine Learning models and explore your data. All of that can be done with the powerful compute engine, combined with an integrated development environment.
As a first-class citizen in Azure, Databricks is a Platform as a Service offering that makes Big Data accessible for everybody.

However, as always, the first steps are the hardest to take. Because of that, in this session, we have a look at how to provision Azure Databricks. You learn how to configure clusters, schedule jobs, stay secure and much more.
