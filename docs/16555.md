## Title: Analysing Data with Power View
## Abstract:
### Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool, and is used to analyse data. Using demos, we learn about using Power View to analyse data, whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will:

- investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles
- examine how data can be analysed with Power View
- look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack

Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.
