## Speaker: Keith Dahlby
## Title: Developer AMA (Ask Me Anything)
## Abstract:
### An "Open Space" discussion facilitated by at least one developer, guided by these principles: whoever comes is the right people; whatever happens is the only thing that could have; and when it's over, it's over. Before it's over, discussion will likely range from "What's wrong with developers?" to "What's wrong with DBAs?" and various more productive topics in between.
