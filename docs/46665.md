## Title: Phone Book Phun - Learning database concepts with the White Pages
## Abstract:
### Come with me back to a simpler time - a time where children played outside by light from a streetlamp, people still listened to music on a cassette tape, and if you wanted to call someone, you looked up their phone number in the phone book (all the while learning some important database concepts).  

Wait...  what was that last part? In this session, you'll gain a deeper understanding of key indexing concepts such as clustering, included columns, sargability, and more through the lens of the good old White Pages.
