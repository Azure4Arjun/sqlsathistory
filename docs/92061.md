### Last year we had the version 1 of this session. Now Azure SQL DW has evolved one year more, and we are seeing it evolving at faster and faster pace. If last year it was great it is even better this year. Same hopefully goes for the session also! Full of demos, examples, some bad jokes and deep internal explanations why you should pick Azure SQL DW for your Cloud-born data warehouse solution.
