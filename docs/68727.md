## Title: Mapping Schema and Recursively Managing Data
## Abstract:
### Deleting, mapping, updating, or otherwise manipulating data in a highly relational environment can be a big challenge!  This is a dive into how we can effectively map out these relationships and use that information to make carefully planned changes to that data.

We will build from the ground up a script that will allow you to gain complete insight into the structure of a relational database.  Not only will this provide a complete map of relationships given a specific SELECT statement, but the TSQL can then be used to generate DELETE and UPDATE statements given that information.  Optimization techniques will be applied to this script to ensure that it executes efficiently, even on a large database.

Can gaining insight into relational structure and design be educational and fun?  YES!!!
