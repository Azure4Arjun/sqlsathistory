## Title: Why Cloud Databases like Amazon Aurora are more Scalable and Reliable
## Abstract:

It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases. This session provides an overview of Aurora, explores Aurora features, such as serverless, global databases, multi-master, replication and multi-AZ failover, and helps you get started.
