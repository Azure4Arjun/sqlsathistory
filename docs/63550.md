## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Free Scripts to Troubleshoot SQL Server: sp_Blitz, sp_BlitzCache, and More
## Abstract:
### You inherited a SQL Server and a bunch of databases from The Last Guy, and you're pretty sure he was drinking on the job. You need to find out just how big of a mess he left you, and what you need to focus on fixing first. You don't want a generic health check - you only wanna fix things that users are going to notice.

In this all-demo no-slides session, you'll learn how to use the open source First Responder Kit: sp_Blitz, sp_BlitzCache, sp_BlitzIndex, sp_BlitzFirst, sp_BlitzWho, and more. Brent Ozar, one of the script authors, will show you what each script does and how to read the results. It's all completely free, maintained by community volunteers, no strings attached. Come see what the community has been working on lately!
