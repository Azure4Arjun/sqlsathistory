## Title: Say what now? SQL Server 2019 + Spark + HDFS???
## Abstract:
### Come learn about one of the ground breaking features being introduced in SQL Server 2019; SQL Server Big Data Clusters. With SQL Server 2019 Big Data clusters we can now create a highly scalable platform that can scale to petabytes of data and enable you to create data virtualization layer that  connects to a variety of data sources such as your traditional Relation Databases, NoSQL and Big Data in one homogenized experience. 

This is a completely different architecture that brings together a unified experience for SQL Server, Spark and HDFS. 

Come join me for and overview and demonstration of the capabilities this platform can deliver.
