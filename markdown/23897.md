## Title: Automate SSIS Development for Loading a Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### SSIS is the tool of choice for loading a data warehouse. But let's face it, dragging round cornered boxes and connecting them with arrows ain't fun. It's time consuming and you'll soon realize you're doing the same thing over and over again. Sam Vanga demonstrates how to dynamically create SSIS packages to process dimension and fact tables using Business Intelligence Markup Language (BIML), a free add-in.
