## Title: Add Power BI to any application!
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wanted to add slick visualizations to your application? Did you fight with 3rd party chart controls or try and host SQL Server Reporting Services reports in that application? Have you ever seen a cool dashboard in Power BI and thought "this is great, but its ANOTHER place that my users need to go for insights they should be able to see in the application? 

The Power BI Embedded services allows you to host interactive visualizations inside of your website or application. This session will walk through the process of embedding a Power BI Report into an application!
