## Title: Introduction to Managed Instances [Video]
## Abstract:
### What are Azure SQL Database Managed Instances?
The range of options for storing data in Microsoft Azure keeps growing, the most notable recent addition is the Managed Instance. But what is it, and why is it there? Join John as he walks through what they are
and how you might start using them.

Managed Instances add a new option for running workloads in the cloud. Allowing near parity with a traditional on-premises SQL Server. Including SQL Agent, Cross Database Queries, Service Broker, CDC, and many more. Overcoming many of the challenges to using Azure SQL Databases.

But, what is the reality, how do we make use of it, and are there any gotchaâ€™s that we need to be aware of? This is what we will cover, going beyond the hype and looking at how we can make use of this new technology, working through a full migration including workload analysis, selecting the appropriate migration pathway and then putting it in place.
