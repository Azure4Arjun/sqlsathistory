## Title: Data Vault data warehousing - an introduction
## Abstract:
### In addition to the Data Vault approach being touted as the next generation data warehouse modelling technique, with the arrival of Data Vault 2.0 comes a complete data modelling, methodology and architectural offering. 
This talk will introduce you to the core Data Vault concepts including support for an agile data warehouse, how it can contribute to faster sprints, how it lends itself to automated data model creation, how the Hub, Link and Satellite design is a perfect fit for massively parallel data load and how to virtualize a Data Mart over a Data Vault. It will also cover how a single version of the facts edges out a single version of the truth. 
Demo: Using a SQL 2017 data source, we will orchestrate the extraction, transformation and load to a Data Vault data warehouse including an example virtualized Data Mart layer. The orchestration will take place using Azure Data Factory v2.
