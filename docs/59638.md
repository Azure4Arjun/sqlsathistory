## Title: Analyzing Execution Plans Like a Pro
## Abstract:
### The most powerful tool when tuning a query is the execution plan. In most cases, by analyzing the execution plan of a query, you can learn all you need to know about how the query processor has chosen to execute the query, what is causing the execution to take so long, and what you can do in order to make it run faster.
But there are common pitfalls that you should be aware of when analyzing an execution plan, such as the fact that the operator cost values are always estimated, or the true meaning of the cardinality numbers within some of the plan operators. These pitfalls can be very misleading, and they might lead you to spend your tuning effort in the wrong direction. By understanding these pitfalls and avoiding them, you can save a lot of time and effort. You’ll become a performance tuning hero by getting the slow queries to run faster – faster…
