## Title: Getting Started with SSIS Script Tasks and Components
## Abstract:
### SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session for an introduction to the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
Many data movement activities can be handled with SSIS using the built-in tasks and components. Eventually, though, you will run into a scenario that will be better handled by extending SSIS functionality with custom code. In this session, we will cover the basics of using scripts in SSIS control flows and data flows. Weâ€™ll talk about the pros and cons of scripts, review the development environment for scripts, cover some interesting and useful .NET classes, and walk through multiple examples of scripts that add useful functionality to SSIS.
