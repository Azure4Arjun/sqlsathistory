## Title: Confio Ignite VM - Monitoring with a Big Picture V
## Abstract:
### More and more companies are virtualizing with VMWare, and SQL Server databases are moving in that direction as well. This presentation will demonstrate how Confio Ignite for VM can assist DBAs with performance - not only at the database layer but at the  VM and host layers. Armed with this birds eye view, DBAs can finally have some say about the environment their databases live in.
