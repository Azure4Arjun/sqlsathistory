## Title: Power BI on  Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### The level of effort to integrate a tabular SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube with Power BI became significantly easier with the release of Azure Analysis Services. Setup, configuration and maintenance of an On Premise gateway for direct query and scheduled data refreshes is no longer required. Leveraging the default Azure Analysis Services integration with Power BI, developers can focus on modeling cubes and creating beautiful dashboards and reports. In this session, we will explore the setup of an Azure Analysis Services as compared to the use of as an On Premise Analysis Services data source for Power BI. 

We will discuss modeling  security patterns in Analysis Services in conjunction with Power BI. We will also demonstrate a direct query connection of On Premise and Azure Analysis Services cubes to Power BI. Additionally, we will highlight leveraging Power BI functionality including reports, dashboards, and QA of an Analysis Services data set.
