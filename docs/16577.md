## Title: Introducing the Reimagined Power BI Platform
## Abstract:
### You have seen glimpses of the new Power BI offering at WPC and PASS in 2014.  Microsoft has totally reimagined the Power BI platform, user experience, added developer APIs, custom apps, hybrid direct connectivity to on-premise data sources without data copying and other top secret enhancements that we can dive into by the time of this session.  Join me to explore all these great changes for both BI professionals and Power BI users.
