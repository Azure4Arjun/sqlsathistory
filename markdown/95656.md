## Title: Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
## Abstract:
### If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.
