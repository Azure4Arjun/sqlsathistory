## Title: Azure IoT, Windows 10 Core  Raspberry PI (DIY)
## Abstract:
### This session will begin, with a high level introduction to Azure Internet of Things, Windows 10 Core and Raspberry PI. Once we have established the basics about the technology, we will be connecting the dots with a live demo on some of the parts. The focus during the demo, will mainly be on Azure IoT Hub, Windows 10 Core and the Raspberry PI and how to DIY. As visualization we will be using Power BI to present the data.
This session is not for the Enterprise rather has a more DIY approach.
