## Title: Run Like Google: Server-less Data warehousing and Analytics on Google Cloud Platform
## Abstract:
### If you are looking for a Data Engineering Platform to run your data warehousing and analytics workloads, look no further.  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offerings have been enabling Enterprises deploy, manage and scale their analytics workloads efficiently. Analyze all your batch and streaming data by creating a logical data warehouse over managed storage, as well as data from object storage and spreadsheets. Create blazing-fast dashboards and reports with the in-memory BI Engine. Build and operationalize machine learning solutions or carry out geospatial analysis using simple SQL. Securely share insights within your organization and beyond as datasets, queries, spreadsheets, and reports.  Deliver a complete data platform without the burden of provisioning, scaling and upgrading infrastructure.
This session will provide a walk-through of Google's approach to Server-less Data warehousing, analytics and architectural patterns to address your needs.
