## Title: Automated Cancer Detection with Deep Learning
## Abstract:
### Deep Learning as a general approach to image processing tasks like detection, recognition and localization have enjoyed tremendous success in recent years. However, deep learning has not yet been applied to certain ripe areas of medical imaging - specifically detecting cancer in gigabit sized scanned slides (commonly referred to as whole slide images or WSIs). In this session Matt will describe the development of an end-to-end image processing system that NLP Logix developed to automate the process of detecting WSI that contain cancer cells. The session will walk through the process of designing the system, training a deep model using TensorFlow (expect a discussion on GPUs) and call out all challenges encountered along the way.

The system developed by NLP Logix received an IEEE award for image process as part of the 2016 Grand Challenges in Biomedical Image Analysis.
