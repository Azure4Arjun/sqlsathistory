## Title: SQL 2012 Error Handling. Pick your Destiny
## Abstract:
### Gone are all the spaghetti errors of past versions of SQL. For example did you know that BEGIN TRANâ€¦COMMIT TRAN is not enough to make everything work together? People are often shocked when they see the demo in this talk where the first statement fails and all others statements still commit. This can still happen to you in SQL 2012 if you are not aware of the options. In fact did you know that when SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action and control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome to the way you want it.
