## Title: Power BI Adoption Framework
## Abstract:
### Power BI has become the new Excel for many business users and its ease of use has made it viral within businesses of all shapes and sizes. 
Many Business Users started using Power BI with minimum / no IT collaboration that started causing concerns especially within larger organisations regarding security, governance, change management, etc.  With the risk of facing another spreadsheet hell in a different form, organisations have become increasingly aware of the need to put a governance and control process in place. 

In this presentation Iman will use his extensive experience in implementing and rolling out Power BI for many organisations to share some tips from his adoption framework for mid to large size organisations.
