## Title: The "Data Loading Performance Guide" Presentation
## Abstract:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. There are quite a few factors that can help, or hurt your goal for tuned performance. For this reason, bulk loading with large amounts of data requires a strategy.

For that strategy, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called “The Data Loading Performance Guide.” The problem is that this guide is long and full of small details that can be confusing and daunting at first glance.

In this session, we will turn this whitepaper into a presentation about creating a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

We will talk about solutions to achieve High Performance Data Loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading, Indexing Techniques including Columstore, properly leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning, Truncate Partition, PolyBase, Delayed Durability, and more.
