## Title: Source Control for Databases: Why You Need It and How To Get Started
## Abstract:
### Source control is popular - even required - for managing changes to application code. It allows multiple people to work on the same code base, track changes, manage conflicts, and have one source of truth for code. Could your databases benefit from having all changes to their schema and objects tracked as well?  Absolutely!

Database administrators *and* developers should attend this working demo session to see how to deploy a database to a development system, how to deploy changes from development back to the production database, and how multiple users can interact simultaneously. You'll leave with an understanding of the concepts of source control, sample code to work with, and a cheat sheet of commands to get you through your first day working with source control.
