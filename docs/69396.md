## Speaker: Mindy Curnutt
## Title: Reading Between the Lines - Using XEvents to Diagnose Application Issues
## Abstract:
### In this Session, 3 different approaches to using Extended Events will be covered - culminating in a non-traditional approach of using them to determine what is MISSING -- thus the application / network portion of a user experience.

We will cover using XEvents  to do the following:
1. The Long Running Query. 
2. The Thousand Paper Cuts - De-Parameterization  Aggregation 
3. Looking at Space Between SQL Calls (how to determine when application slowness does NOT involve the SQL Server). 
 
Each approach will detail the following:
 
Creating an Extended Events Session to capture the information you need for each scenario.
How to analyze and make sense of the captured data. 
Lots of demos and take-away scripts!
