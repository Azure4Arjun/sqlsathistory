## Title: Keeping your SQL Objects Safe In Development
## Abstract:
### It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.
