## Title: Utiizando Microsoft Assestment and Planning toolkit MAP para planear tu migraci√≥n a Microsoft Azure
## Abstract:
### Larger IT organizations are likely to have a proliferation of SQL Server installations that are not fully known to the internal IT department. Furthermore, some of these installations may be in various stages of repair because they are not managed systematically. If these unsupervised SQL databases carry business-critical or sensitive information without backup or control, this can be problematic for the organization.
The MAP Toolkit helps you create an inventory of all the SQL Server installations in the network, complete with component and version information. This information can help you consider the value of consolidating, possibly virtualizing, certain databases, and bringing them under IT supervision when appropriate.
