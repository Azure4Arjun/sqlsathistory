## Title: Using Models as the Blueprints for Enterprise Data Governance
## Abstract:
### Data governance is becoming increasingly important to corporations who must demonstrate compliance to industry and corporate regulations. This is occurring against a backdrop of continuously evolving technology, an explosion of diverse data sources, and exponential growth in volume. Data professionals are tasked with ensuring data quality, enforcing data security, tracking model changes, and complying with audits. We will discuss a practical, model-based approach to enterprise data governance, with a focus on Master Data Management (MDM).
