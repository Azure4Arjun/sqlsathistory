# Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-94)
Event Date: 10-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 302
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
## Abstract:
### 
The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Performance for Devs
## Abstract:
### 
If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

# Parallel Processing Database Architecture
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-94)
Event Date: 10-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 309 
## Speaker: Jeff Renz
## Title: Parallel Processing Database Architecture
## Abstract:
### If you want to architect a parallel processing system, Data Vault should be your preferred architecture.  In this session I will introduce you to the Data Vault design pattern and demonstrate the major performance advantages of this architecture.  Data Vault hub, link and satellite tables allow for vertical and horizontal partitioning of data.  When properly implemented, your database tables will provide the most index coverage of any indexing system and provide the fastest possible disk scan access.  I will provide a real world example of a parallel manufacturing execution system that we developed at Abound Solar which implements the Data Vault architecture.

## Speaker: Pat Wright
## Title: MySQL Vs SQL Server Are they really different? 
## Abstract:
### I hear all the time that someone should upgrade from MySQL to SQL Server.  Is it really an upgrade or just the same animal with a different face, we will discuss the differences between the engines, tools, administration and  indexes.  If you’d like to really find out how similar these two animals are you won’t want to miss this.

# Utility Database
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-94)
Event Date: 10-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 300 
## Speaker: Christopher Shaw
## Title: Utility Database
## Abstract:
### If you were asked what average runtime was of your slowest stored procedure, could you provide the answer? What if you needed to provide that information for last month? Do you review your error logs each day? Do you know the growth percentages of your databases for the past year or even the past month? If your database has an unusual growth event will you know about it? 

In the utility database that we create during this session we will track stored procedure information along with information about the hard drives such as free space. We will look at how you can have the errors in your error logs emailed to you each day. The goal of this session is to help you automate and centralize as many of your day-to-day tasks as you can.

## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Documentation – you know you love it
## Abstract:
### We will discuss some of the most important things that you as a Data Professional can document to make your job much easier, ensure information consistency between groups, and better prepare your organizations for raising the bar on your day to day business.  Think of this as a sort of Database Library that allows you to finally detail the processes you follow currently to perform repetitive tasks.  This Library will also allow you to simply document your systems for your and others knowledge.  Some of the documents and processes we will review are:

# Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-94)
Event Date: 10-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 302
## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t
## Abstract:
### We often run a fine line between how much space we need, and how much space we have for our databases.  Having too much drive space can be a waste of resources; however, running out of space is an obvious issue.  Let’s find a way to straddle the line and determine just how much space we really need, give ourselves a bit more than that, and make it a regular process to baseline, then continue to monitor, make adjustments along the way if needed, and ultimately plan for just enough space to get us through the year on budget.  
We’ll talk about a stand-alone tool that I used to determine space use for baseline, continued monitoring of the space used, and ensuring we have enough but not too much space.

# Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-94)
Event Date: 10-09-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 302
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)
## Abstract:
### Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson discusses the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS with Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities, and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs. This is the initial session of a set of detailed Best Practices presentations.
