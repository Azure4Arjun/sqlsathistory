# An Introduction to ASP.NET MVC
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#19-East-Iowa-2009)
Event Date: 17-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: App Dev II
## Speaker: Chris Sutton
## Title: An Introduction to ASP.NET MVC
## Abstract:
### ASP.NET MVC is Microsoft's implementation of an old design pattern, which fits web development better than ASP.NET does. It simplifies multiple aspects of web development that were complex in ASP.NET. It also gives ASP.NET developers a better and more accurate abstraction layer over the web. For example it doesn't use the problematic ViewState object. It removes most of the overly complex page lifecycle and it simplifies the ability to unit test web requests.

In this presentation we'll explain the MVC terminology and then we'll explore how to work with Controllers, Actions, Views and the Model. Then we'll walk though a real but simple ASP.NET MVC site so you can leave this session with enough knowledge to start a new ASP.NET MVC project.

# SQL Server 2008 R2 - Moving to the Next Level
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#19-East-Iowa-2009)
Event Date: 17-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: App Dev II
## Speaker: Chuck Heinzelman
## Title: SQL Server 2008 R2 - Moving to the Next Level
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 provided us with many features that developers and database administrators have been asking about for years.  Separate Date and Time data types, sparse columns, FILESTREAM and compression for both data and backups have made the platform better than ever.  So how do you build on a platform that strong?  By adding features like multi-server management, application management and complex event processing, of course.  Come along with me as we explore these new features with the August CTP of SQL Server 2008 R2.

## Speaker: Chuck Heinzelman
## Title: SQL Server 2008 - Practical Uses for New Features
## Abstract:
### When learning a new technology, I like to try to solve a real-world problem that will help me not only learn but also help me in my daily life.  Learning SQL Server 2008 was no exception for me.  Through the building of an electronic recipe box, I have taken advantage of many of the new features of SQL Server 2008 – including sparse columns, filestream, table-valued parameters, the MERGE statement and even spatial data.  Come learn from my experiences as we walk through the design and development of this application – and you can even have the code when we’re done!

# Introduction to PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#19-East-Iowa-2009)
Event Date: 17-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: App Dev I
## Speaker: Keith Dahlby
## Title: Introduction to PowerShell
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is Microsoft's next-generation command-line shell and scripting language. In this session we will discuss why you need it, how to use it, and what makes it different from any other shell on any platform. For administrators, Microsoft is investing heavily in PowerShell as the hub for its Windows Server products, starting with Exchange 2007 and SQL Server 2008. For developers, PowerShell provides full access to .NET for Read-Eval-Print loops (REPL), rapid prototyping, object exploration and extensibility. We will take a quick look at features for both groups before diving into an interactive demo, so come prepared with questions you have or problems we can solve together.

Event Date: 17-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI / Relational Theory
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions.  In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.

# Database Design
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#19-East-Iowa-2009)
Event Date: 17-10-2009 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI / Relational Theory
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design
## Abstract:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

Information that was used difficult or pert near impossible to obtain is now at your fingertips.  Unfortunately there are many find DMVs and DMFs mysterious.  Step under SQL Servers hood and find answers to some common issues through DMVs and DMFs.  From sessions to caches, this presentation will provide a walk-through of some of the more useful DMVs and a take practical look at how they can be used?

## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Improving Daily Imports with Partitioned Tables
## Abstract:
### At some point, everyone struggles with loading data to OLTP systems.  The business needs the data loaded so that users can work through the data.  But the users can’t afford the downtime to get the data into the production tables.  In this session we’ll review this problem and how to use partitioning to alleviate this issue.

## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: Tips Tricks For Administering SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I've developed a toolbox of scripts that I rely on to give me insight into disk space, database file growth, backup status, job status, and login management.  Some of these I've shared on mssqltips.com, others are seeing the public light for the first time.  Attendees go home with scripts they can immediately put to use in their organizations.
