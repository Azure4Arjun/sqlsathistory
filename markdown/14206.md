## Title: We Have Normality
## Abstract:
### The relational database architecture stands on solid mathematical footing. Central to the math behind the relational architecture is the concept of normalization. This presentation goes through each of the major normal forms, describing (with examples each step along the way) how to get into each normal form, why you want to be in that normal form, and how to recognize when you are not in that normal form. This talk will show you exactly why good normalization technique is vital in relational database design.
