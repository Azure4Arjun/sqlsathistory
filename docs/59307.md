## Title: Responding to Extended Events in near real-time
## Abstract:
### Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, a way to react to the events as soon as they happen seems to be lacking.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions.
