## Speaker: Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment is maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Additionally by default, SQL Server does not install with the best practices for every environment. You will learn best practices for system settings, file system layout and scheduling maintenance tasks. You will learn about what the best practices are for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both a physical and virtual world. You will learn about the tradeoffs and benefits to completely automating the build process. You were hear about lessons learned building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company. You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure consistency with your servers whether they are in the cloud, or on-premises.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: The Database: The Elephant in the ALM Room
## Abstract:
### Many teams and individuals are still building their databases and maintaining them through old-fashioned manual processes. This, even as these same teams move towards an automated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) through the adoption of DevOps best practices. These manual processes are hurting the ability of your database deployments to keep up with modern development. Is there a technical reason for this slow adoption of ALM best practices in the database world, or is there a cultural problem preventing a reassessment of these manual processes? Or, could it be both? This session will address these questions as it explores the challenges presented by ALM for databases. We will discuss the necessary first steps required to move from a manual database deployment process to a fully automated one. You will learn about tooling that can assist you in implementing these new processes. Your database deployments can take advantage of the same processes you use for application deployments.

## Speaker: Mickey Stuewe
## Title: Silent Killers Lurking in Your Database Design
## Abstract:
### A good database design goes deeper than the rules that Codd gave us. We need to leverage SQL Server to help enforce these rules. In this class we’ll look at some common questions like: I have foreign keys, why do I need foreign key constraints too? Why are smart keys not so smart? If I use an identity field, do I still need to declare it as a primary key? The wrong answers to these questions can slow your queries down over time and even create bad data. Join me in my session as we look at demos to understand how silent killers can begin to lurk in your database.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Title: A Masters Passport to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

## Title: Code Sins
## Abstract:
### It’s impossible to follow every best practice all the time. “Code sins” are those things we do to our code that are either so horrendous that they can’t be borne, or that have such tremendous consequences that your stored procedures wish they’d never been created. Attendees will hear about the most common code sins that make code difficult to read, support, run and extend, and practical strategies for reversing the trend.

## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### Are you tired of users constantly coming to you for data?  Would like to be able to quickly and easily enable your uses to go get the data themselves?  Do you simply not have the budget/executive buy in to buy a solution?  In this session you will see how easy this often overlooked and underutilized feature of SQL Server is to use.  This session will start with a quick overview of some reporting examples and will then cover the basics of developing, publishing and using an SSRS report.  It will cover all aspects from connecting to the data source through putting the data on the page to publishing to the report server.  You will learn how you can return to the office and present meaningful data to your end users with minimal time and effort with this very powerful and easy to use tool that can relieve you from data delivery tasks and thrill your end users all at the same time.

## Title: Architectural Designs Driving SQL Server Performance  Availability
## Abstract:
### DBAs are often asked to design database infrastructure for new applications or upgrade existing systems. Therefore, they must have a keen understanding of the application’s requirements, operational environment, and infrastructure so they can recommend the best approach.

In this session, you’ll learn about the latest advancements in storage technology, the various ways flash can be deployed (flash caching, server-side PCIe flash, hybrid, and all-flash), and the pros and cons for each. We’ll also discuss how a well-designed infrastructure can drive efficiencies and help your organization save on licensing and maintenance costs.

## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Title: Designing Stored Procedure Solutions
## Abstract:
### With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.
