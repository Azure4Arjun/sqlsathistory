## Title: RedGate - Automatically Tracking  Deploying Database Changes in Order
## Abstract:
### Managing individual database scripts is often seen as slow, old-fashioned and error-prone. But how times have changed. With more teams automating deployments, script-based change processes (sometimes called “Migrations”) are undergoing a renaissance. When the SQL code is visible up-front, an exact change can be rehearsed through progressively more realistic test environments, so that deployment contains no surprises.
Come see how easy it can be to track all your database changes in Visual Studio and deploy those changes to a test and production environments reliably.
