## Title: Getting the most out of Power View
## Abstract:
### Power View is a visual data exploration tool that comes built into Excel 2013. With it you can build charts that seamlessly interact with each other and quickly map your data using Bing maps. In this session, you will learn how to get the most out of Power View: what it does well and what it doesn't so you can maximize the value you get out of it in a minimum amount of time.
