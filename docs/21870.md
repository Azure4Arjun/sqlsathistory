## Speaker: Paul Turley
## Title: Power BI Hands-On Micro-Workshop
## Abstract:
### Bring your laptop and let's build a BI solution using the components of Power BI!  You'll need Office 2013 ProPlus (you can install the trial) and the Power Query add-in.  I'll provide everything else.  This 95% demo and uber-fast hands-on lab session will show you how to cleanse and transform data from multiple sources with Power Query, model data for reporting with Power Pivot and then explore the model and build interactive dashboards with Power View.  You'll leave with a working BI solution.
