## Title: A DBAs Guide to the Proper Handling of Corruption
## Abstract:
### Corruption can strike at any time. As DBAs, how we alert, investigate, and respond can have a profound impact on our company. In this session we will learn how to detect and respond to various types of corruption. In this introductory session for beginners we will introduce the concepts around how to monitor and respond to corruption incidents in our databases.

First we will focus on ways to detect corruption early. This will include understanding tools available to us like DBCC CheckDB as well as the importance of testing our backups. We’ll also look at some sample scripts to automate corruption checks and common alerts we should have set up on our instances.

Then we will move onto how to properly manage an incident and discuss some common examples of corruption. We’ll look at how we can analyze the situation safely as well as point out various pitfalls that trip people up. We’ll also discuss when and how we may be able to fix corruption vs restoring the database.
