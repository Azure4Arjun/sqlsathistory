## Title: Micro ORM - a petite beauty or a poison in a small flask?
## Abstract:
### For developers with good knowledge of SQL using a micro ORM seems like an obvious choice. But is it? In the session we will discover the features of  the micro ORM called Dapper and how can it simplify your way of communicating with the database. Then we will compare it to the Entity Framework and analyze when you should use one or the other - or neither. But wait! There is more! At the end you will see how easy it is to write a Dapper extension where the classes in your code will magically receive super SQL querying powers.
