## Speaker: Stephanie Locke
## Title: Shipping Data Science products with R and Docker
## Abstract:
### There’s no point being a data scientist if your work never makes it to production. This session explores a solution for getting your code live, scalable, and easily managed.

Covering models, dashboards, and other products built in R, you’ll look at how Docker containers can make managing dependencies a breeze, allow your code to be hosted anywhere, and have it work in high-scale systems.
