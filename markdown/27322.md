## Speaker: Seth Valdetero
## Title: iPhone Apps in C#
## Abstract:
### Mobile development has traditionally been having to learn a new language for that platform and new ways of doing the same â€˜ole thing. Cross-platform development has been especially burdensome since that means multiple code-bases in different languages that have to be kept in sync. Mono aims to make cross-platform mobile development easier by leveraging your existing .NET skills. You no longer need to spend your time re-learning the wheel and hopefully you can save even more time by sharing the majority of your code across all of the platforms. In this session, we will be looking specifically into the iOS platform and how to get started writing iPhone apps in C# and hopefully Visual Studio.
