## Title: Pandas Dataframes: The Kevin Bacon of the data structures in data analytics
## Abstract:
### In the 'Seven Degrees' game, the goal is to connect actors with, or through, Kevin Bacon.  If we can connect you to Kevin, we win.  Likewise, data scientists seek structures that allow for data importation, transformation, manipulation, analysis, and export.  Luckily, all Python data science roads lead to the popular Pandas package and the trusty dataframe.  If we can get the data into a dataframe, we win.
