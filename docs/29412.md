## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Tune a Star Schema for High Performance Reporting
## Abstract:
### A data warehouse built using star schema dimensional models can be tuned to handle a demanding workload put on it by its users who require fast reports, dashboards, data extracts, and ad-hoc analysis.  In this session Carlos Bossy will discuss the unique problems associated with star schema query performance and present strategies that will allow you to handle large query volumes in a dimensional environment.  Topics covered will include clustering, indexing and partitioning, and how to treat fact tables different from dimension tables.
