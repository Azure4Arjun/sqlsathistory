## Title: Containerize your learning - a docker introduction
## Abstract:
### You've heard about docker, but haven't found that use case for it yet or simply just don't have the time to learn it.  This session will start off showing you what docker is at a high level, and its many simple use cases.  You'll leave with enough knowledge to either use someone else's docker image or build your own.  All if this without needing to install docker on your machine. We'll go into how to spin up an environment using a cloud resource in minutes.  After that, we'll install a graphical interface for docker in a docker image to help speed up your learning.  From there, we will even spin up an SQL Server in a container that can start and stop in little to no time.
