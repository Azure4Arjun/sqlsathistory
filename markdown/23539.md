## Title: Discover the power of Visual Studio db projects
## Abstract:
### Many teams use Visual Studio as a development environment for .NET code as well as BI solutions, but fewer have made this the base technology for creating databases.  In this session, you'll learn what advantages Visual Studio provides as a database development environment.  The session will also provide an example of how such projects can be extended to interact with other tools.
