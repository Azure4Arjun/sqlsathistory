## Title: SSIS - Analyzing your data integrating PowerShell
## Abstract:
### This is a sample of buidling an SSIS solution to assist in analysing data been rejected by the Import process.  Then, we integrate a PowerShell application to consolidate this rejected records building a dynamic table to view these data.  I will be covering the use of Script_Task and Script_Components.  Also, creation of variables and how to pass parameters to a PowerShell application.  This is a good example for all BI interested in how to use PowerShell in their ETL process.
