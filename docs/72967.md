## Speaker: Mark Pryce-Maher
## Title: SQL Server on your favourite operating system....Linux
## Abstract:
### Hopefully you will have heard last year that Microsoft have release their premier database platform on Linux. After you spat your coffee all over your keyboard and then clean up, you must be wondering why?

In this session, I will talk about where and when SQL Server on Linux is a good fit, how it works under the covers ( don't worry I won't go into too much deal ) - then we will hit the demos; installing and configuring, but mostly showing it's just the same great SQL Server we know and love, just not on Windows. I will also show SQL Server in docker container for those of your that love docker.
