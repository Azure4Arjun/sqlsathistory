## Speaker: John Flannery
## Title: Data Partitioning in SQL 2012
## Abstract:
### We will discuss both the “how tos” and “why tos” of data partitioning.  We will actually partition sales data in AdventureWorks2008R2.  (Bring a copy – play along.)  The majority of the presentation will focus on the performance effects of partitioning – and what to look for in query plans.  In addition, we will discuss and implement adding a new partition, splitting off a partition, splitting on a partition (common in Data Warehouse scenarios), Aligned Indexes, Partial Database Availability and Statistics management implications.
