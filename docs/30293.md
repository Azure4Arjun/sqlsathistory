## Title: The T-SQL Trifecta:  Enhancements for Everyone
## Abstract:
### There have been many useful enhancements to T-SQL provided with SQL Server 2008 and 2005.  Come learn about three of them:  MERGE, TRY...CATCH, and multi-row INSERT statements.  If you've ever written an UpSert, given yourself carpal tunnel syndrome cutting and pasting INSERT statements, or conveniently forgotten to write in robust error handling because it was too cumbersome,  find out how T-SQL can work better for you and for your code.
