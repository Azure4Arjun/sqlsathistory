## Title: Modern Reporting with SQL Server 2016 and 2017 Reporting Services
## Abstract:
### The 2016 product release was a big upgrade that, once again, brought SSRS into center stage as a market-leading reporting and dashboard design tool for operational and BI reporting.  The big news was that SSRS reports truly run in all modern web browsers and work on mobile devices and all desktops in a new modern web portal.  The introduction of Mobile Reports, formerly known as Datazen, gives mobile device users interactive, tactile and actionable dashboard style reporting on all the popular mobile smartphones and tablets.  The 2017 product brings even more goodness with the integration of Power BI Report Server, on-premises Power BI report integration in a cloud-free platform.  Join Paul for a full-day pre-conference session where you will explore new capabilities and learn to integrate modern reporting into your data platform.

• What’s new in Reporting Services 2017 (and 2016)?
