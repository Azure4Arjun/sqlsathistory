## Title: Implementing security in Azure Data Platform Solutions
## Abstract:
### As computing environments is moving customer-controlled on premises data centers to cloud data centers, the responsibility of security also shifts. Security is nowadays a concern shared by cloud providers, organizations and individuals. For every solution, it's important to understand what's solution provider responsibility and what's Azure's responsibility.

In this presentation, attendees will see how Azure provides a multi-layered security model to protect customer data. I will show how security can range from setting up secure networks and access keys, to defining permission and to monitoring with Advanced Threat Detection across a range of data stores.
