## Title: Extend Power BI with Python
## Abstract:
### Most developers use Power BI desktop to design the visuals and publish to the Azure service for production. 

Out of the box, Power BI has 29 visuals.  There are 208 custom visuals that can be down loaded from Appsource.Microsoft.com. 

While there are many choices, the business problem might not have an out of the box visual that can be customized the way you want.  How do you solve this problem?

This is where the custom scripting with Python visual comes in.  

At the end of the presentation you will know which libraries that you can use to extend your toolbox for both on premise and the azure service.

# 4 Threats to your SQL Servers - Become Default: Secure
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#855---Albany-2019)
Event Date: 20-07-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Data Security
## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: 4 Threats to your SQL Servers - Become Default: Secure
## Abstract:
### In our connected world, the threat landscape is rapidly increasing. Phishing is leading to severe and crippling ransomware attacks. Malicious outsiders (and insiders) have cost much downtime. Not to mention the "traditional" threats such as "oops deletes" or site crashes. How do we protect against all of this? Is this even the DBA's role?

In this session, we'll explore 4 types of active threats to your data and organization. We'll talk about the various solutions available and help you see which threats you are vulnerable to if you've not gone far enough as we match threats and answers. Sadly, we'll share real stories of folks who've lost it all from these threats.

It's more than "take your backups, verify them, and periodically test them!" Ransomware and malicious outsiders (or insiders) eat your online backups for breakfast. 

Leave prepared, not scared, as you adopt a "Default: Secure" posture and lead the charge, even if we are "only" DBAs.

# SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#855---Albany-2019)
Event Date: 20-07-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Paul Stanton
## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
## Abstract:
### DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Speaker: Deborah Melkin
## Title: Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together
## Abstract:
### Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.

# Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#855---Albany-2019)
Event Date: 20-07-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments
## Abstract:
### Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.

## Title: Azure Machine Learning 101
## Abstract:
### There are several ways to create a machine learning model. You can use R or Python or even other languages such as C#. Advanced coding skills are required no matter which language you choose. Once the solution is created, it’s often difficult to deploy. 

Microsoft addresses those problems with Azure Machine Learning, or Azure ML. Azure ML has built-in transforms for cleansing and munging data. It also contains a variety of configurable machine learning models that can be used without coding. Deploying the model is easy, and users can link to it directly with Excel or a custom application can be written.

If you are experienced in machine learning but haven’t seen Azure ML or if you are curious about machine learning and data science, this session is for you.

## Speaker: Guy Glantser
## Title: The Complete Guide to Temporary Tables and Table Variables
## Abstract:
### It is very common to use temporary data structures in the database. In SQL Server, we can choose between temporary tables (#MyTable) and table variables (@MyTable). There are many differences between these two structures, some are obvious and well known, and some might surprise you.
The main difference in terms of performance is statistics, which exist for a temporary table, but do not exist for a table variable. For that reason, there can be a huge difference in performance of a stored procedure that uses one data structure or the other.
In this session, we will demonstrate the differences and analyze performance for various use cases. We will cover all kinds of ways to work with these data structures, such as OPTION (RECOMPILE) and trace flag 2453.
By the end of this session you will know exactly when and how to use each one in order to achieve the desired functionality with the best performance.
This is a must session for every SQL Server developer.

## Title: Blogging for Success: Advancing your career by blogging
## Abstract:
### Ever wanted to start a 'blog, but have no idea how to do it?  It's easier than you think!  A number of people have become successful by writing 'blog articles.  I originally started my 'blog to supplement my presentations.  Since then, it's taken on a life of its own.

In this presentation, I'll tell you how I got started with 'blogging, where it's taken me since then, and lessons I've learned along the way.  We'll discuss 'blog platforms, how to get started, what to write about, and what to do (and what NOT to do) when writing articles.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Staging data for Azure SQL services
## Abstract:
### Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.
