# Serene Velocity:  Reporting Services and SSAS 2008
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI and T-SQL tracks
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Serene Velocity:  Reporting Services and SSAS 2008
## Abstract:
### SSRS 2008 R2 provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many of these features, such as the server aggregation function, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.

## Speaker: Rohan Joackhim
## Title: SQL Server 2008 Policy-Based Management (PBM)
## Abstract:
### This session will take you from the basics to the intermediate level of policy based management (PBM) in SQL Server 2008.What are Facets, Policies, Categories and Execution Modes? How you can manage over 500 SQL Server instances in a high availability environment using predefined policies?  What policies are important for you and how to implement them? How do we evaluate and find out the failed policies? All these will be answered during this presentation.

# Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!

Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI and T-SQL tracks
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!
## Abstract:
### In a world…where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked…one man….WILL. GET. EVEN.  In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up.  Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, hiding and obfuscating data and code, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem.  And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!

# Revenge: The SQL!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI and T-SQL tracks
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them. (But they deserved it!) Learn how to: create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!

# Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI and T-SQL tracks
## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
## Abstract:
### Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

# What when and why - Resource Governor
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Tracks
## Speaker: Roy Ernest
## Title: What when and why - Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### This presentation will explain the three W's (What, When and Why) regarding Resource governor, This presentation will also provide some Best practice guides for using Resource governor. We will also look at its limitations as well.
We will look in depth the three basic fundamentals to the resource governor: Resource pool, workload group and classifier functions. We will also be looking at how to leverage the Resource governors to control runaway queries, limiting parallelism.

# You Inherited a Database, Now What?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Tracks
## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: You Inherited a Database, Now What?
## Abstract:
### You have recently inherited the support of a new or existing database, what are the things you should immediately check and start monitoring and what are the things that you should address over the next few weeks. When taking over support of a database or system, you cannot ASSUME anything. At the end of this session you will have a nice checklist of things you should check and be doing on ALL your databases not just the one you inherited. Whether you are a seasoned DBA or just starting out, this session should be informative and something you can relate to.

# It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Tracks
## Speaker: Tim Radney
## Title: It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?
## Abstract:
### TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.

# Getting Started with MDX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#103---Curacao-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI and T-SQL tracks
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
