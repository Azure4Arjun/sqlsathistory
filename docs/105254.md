## Title: A Walk Around SQL PowerShell
## Abstract:
### PowerShell has been out for a long time now, and it is certainly not new for the DBA with all the modules and code floating around, yet there are many that have decided not to adopt it. This session takes a casual walk around SQL and PowerShell together and shows how powerful it is and how easy it is to get started. But be warned, once you slip into the pool and get past the shock of the "colder than you like" water, you will be hooked. Don't take my word for it, join me for a session that takes you through a little SMO and last the SQLServer module and the provider it gives you access to. You will be glad you did.
