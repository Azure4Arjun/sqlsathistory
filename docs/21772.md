## Title: Real-Time Analytics with SSAS Tabular DirectQuery
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore how SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular running in DirectQuery mode can be used to power real-time analytics. In DirectQuery mode the data is guaranteed to be up-to-date, no refreshing or processing is necessary, because DirectQuery mode queries data that is stored in a SQL Server database.  We will provide concepts and step-by-step examples of setting up a BI Semantic Model, including security, best practices for getting the most out of Power View and the differences between DirectQuery and the In-Memory VertiPaq cache, so you are equipped to start building real-time analytics solutions with SSAS and Power View.
