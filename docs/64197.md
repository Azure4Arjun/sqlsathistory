## Speaker: Mark Marinovic
## Title: How'd they get in there?  Utilities to map all paths users have to access data
## Abstract:
### Look smart and organized!!  Weâ€™ll be presenting two SQL scripts that enable DBAs and Developers alike to see all of the access paths users have into SQL Server.

Script #1 will show you all of the users, groups, and roles that have access to your SQL server and what Server Roles, Database Roles, and Object-Specific permissions each has in a single tabular result.  It also provides the SQL to recreate the exact same permissions on another instance.

Script #2 will show you all access paths a specific user has to data, including what AD Group Membership/s SQL sees, orphaned db users, and pretty much anything that will allow or prevent access.  As with Script #1, you can copy and paste SQL to recreate these exact permissions on another instance.

This session is for the DBA or Accidental DBA who regularly fields questions about database access, why a certain user can or cannot access data, or a DBA who's curious to audit their own SQL footprint.
