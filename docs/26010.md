## Title: 45 min to build your first SSRS report
## Abstract:
### Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed. We’ll even look at the differences between building a report in BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and Report Builder 3.0. We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2012. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output.
