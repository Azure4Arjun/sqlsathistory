## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Perfmon  Profiler 101
## Abstract:
### These two tools are the key to successful performance tuning.  I’ll show you how to get started with these tools, how to slice and dice the results, and even how to data mine the results to look for interesting trends.  Whether you like to monitor performance with native tools or third party utilities, knowing how the native tools work will help you get better results out of your tools.  You'll learn why Perfmon is like a Nissan GT-R’s dashboard, what Perfmon counters to measure (and why), and how to use ClearTrace to get insight into your trace files.
