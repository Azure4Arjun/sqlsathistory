## Speaker: Andrew Fryer
## Title: Machine Learning without a PhD in statisitcs
## Abstract:
### Machine learning is the science of making computers act without being unambiguously programmed. Machine learning (ML) is something that we use every day when we search and shop on the web and talk to our devices. Microsoft Azure ML is a fully-managed cloud service that enables data aware developers to efficiently embed predictive analytics into their applications,  without a PhD in statistics helping organizations use massive data sets and bring all the benefits of the cloud to machine learning. So join Andrew for a practical insight into the fascinating world of Machine Learning, where you can be significantly different but never certain, deviation is normal, and you are amongst friends if you found the above quote funny.
