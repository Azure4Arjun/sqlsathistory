## Title: Power BI Data Modeling with Less Than Ideal Data Sources
## Abstract:
### Ever get frustrated when watching Power BI training videos or reading through best practice documentation because the data sources that you have at work aren't anything like the pristine data warehouse sources from the video?

This course will provide guidance and tips for building a solid Power BI data model with less than ideal data sources.  If you have ever struggled building a data model from super wide, flattened out excel spreadsheets, this course is for you.  We'll start off with some flattened data sources and end up with a star schema that will impress any data warehouse architect!
