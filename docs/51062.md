## Title: Connecting Mobile Apps with an ASP.NET Web API
## Abstract:
### In this talk, we'll create an ASP.NET Web API from scratch, and then demonstrate how you can communicate with it and manipulate data using a cross-platform (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone) Xamarin Forms app. Because ASP.NET Web API is a RESTful framework, you'll also be able to use this API with any other platform that can make HTTP calls.
