## Title: Programmatically Managing the BI Stack Metadata
## Abstract:
### This session will dive into the the SSIS toolkit by creating SSIS Custom Components in SQL Server 2008 and 2012. Discuss how to register the custom components and add to the SSIS Toolbox. Demonstrate a method to open an SSIS package with a C# script and read or make changes to the package design. The start of data driven design and programmatically creating packages, scan an entire BIDS Solution all cubes, dimensions, and connections in SSAS using Analysis Management Objects (AMO) with C#. This allows us to create a metadata mart and full documentation of our SSAS cubes.
