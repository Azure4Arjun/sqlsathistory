## Speaker: Drew Furgiuele
## Title: Introduction to Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### Big data processing solutions don't need to be complicated to get up and running, and thanks to Azure Databricks, it isn't! In this session, we'll cover what Azure Databricks is, go over some popular use cases, and what you can expect from an administrative standpoint if you decide to implement solutions with it. We'll also cover the basics of setting up Azure Databricks and go over what goes on "under the covers" in the cloud when you use it to provision compute for your big data processing needs. 

With plenty of demos on how to configure cloud storage, work with Databricks notebooks, and even some Apache Spark thrown in, you'll come to appreciate very quickly just how powerful (and flexible) a solution like Databricks is.

Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Clark Hahn
## Title: What I Learned Stepping onto the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Previously titled Stumbling and Bumbling onto the Cloud. In this "non-technical" presentation the presenter regales the audience with the missteps, mistakes, and land mines, encountered over the past year in his role as DBA/Data Architect/Data Lackey. 
When your management says “Cloud First” and you’ve got to ask “How high”, and then work your way into actual solutions, it can lead to some real forehead smacking moments. And by “Cloud First”, they mean Azure First and foremost. 
If this sounds like a direction in which you will be headed, or you enjoy Schadenfreude…
Remember a smart person learns from their mistakes, a wise person learns from other people’s mistakes.

# SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#886---Indianapolis-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Dan Mallott
## Title: SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen
## Abstract:
### Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.

## Title: Brick-by-Brick: Foundational Azure Databricks Concepts
## Abstract:
### As the business need for data becomes more prominent, the platform that IT builds on becomes a crucial component to the success of any data analytics project.  Apache Spark centralizes the information management process by providing a unified platform.  Azure Databricks takes that concept one step further by providing a layer of abstraction from Apache Spark, which allows for easier adoption of a big data ecosystem.  This presentation and demonstration will dive into the core concepts of Azure Databricks by focusing on three main use cases: ETL/ELT, Structured Streaming, and Machine Learning.

# Stuck In the Middle: Collaborating With Multiple Stakeholders
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#886---Indianapolis-2019)
Event Date: 17-08-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Lou` Russell
## Title: Stuck In the Middle: Collaborating With Multiple Stakeholders
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it – your management and peers have no idea what you’re doing, how much work and time it takes or even what you do as a database professional. Your role is stuck in the middle.  Management is reluctant to prioritize the money to create better equipment and software updates. Developers don’t want you messing with their work.  Both are annoyed when you bother them with a customer problem or when you can’t fix issues instantly. This dynamic triad (you, developers and management) will always have differing views but this diversity of thought can be leveraged to create powerful customer solutions. In this session, you’ll learn simple techniques to build collaboration, mitigate conflict, meet the customer needs and get everyone on the same page.

## Speaker: Dustin Dorsey
## Title: Managing the mystery database
## Abstract:
### As database administrators, we often are responsible for managing large amounts of databases so it can be difficult to understand who or what is using each of them and why. Yet we are responsible for making sure these databases are backed up, secure and cared for. As well as, we are responsible for leading projects such as upgrades and migrations where this information becomes relevant. If application owners and documentation exist, we can certainly utilize that, but what if it doesn’t or information is limited. This session will look at tips and tricks you can do to figure out what these mystery databases are so you can make better decisions on them. 

By figuring out what these mystery databases, you will be more equipped to make decisions on several items such as the following: 
•	Decommissions
•	Lower resource allocation and costs (especially for storage)
•	Better planning for database migrations
•	Troubleshoot connection issues
•	Better planning for SQL upgrades

## Title: Enable Real-time Analytics and Machine Learning with Azure Stream Analytics
## Abstract:
### As Organizations are looking to transform into data driven organizations. Stream analytics has emerged as an integral part of Enterprise Data platform architectures along with batch ETL. Stream analytics help to gain maximum value from user-interaction events, applications and machine logs. Ingesting, processing, and analyzing these data streams quickly and efficiently is critical in fraud detection, click stream analysis, sentiment analytics, online recommendations and IOT Scenarios among many examples. In this session we will look at options available in azure for real-time analytics and deep dive into Azure Stream Analytics. Build streaming jobs that can blend and aggregate data as it arrives to drive live Power BI dashboards. Plus, we’ll explore how a complete lambda architecture can be created when combining stream and batch data together and finally how it integrates with Azure ML.

## Speaker: Ameena Lalani
## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well.

## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

## Abstract:
### Ever the one left out, Pluto's status as a key member of the solar system has been under scrutiny in recent years and the debate rages on.

In the age of AI, surely it's an easy problem to solve with computering. I'm sure Microsoft has a crack team of hackstars working on it right now. What toolset do you think they would use to do something like that? Probably some fancy cloud bricks or something.

Anyway, I'm sure this is possible. It has to be, we'd just need to learn about:

- A distributed analytics platfrom able to work with tons of raw planetary data
- An AI platform that is performant and allows a team of developers to collaborate and improve the product
- The ability to call the model billions and billions and billions and billions errr

I don't think this will take much longer than 75 mins. Might as well get to it.

(Psst: You're going to learn all about scalable data processing and web scale analytics using Azure Databricks, MLFlow, and Azure ML)

DBAs are naturally wary of Docker's stateless and transient paradigm.  In this session we'll discuss what Docker is, how SQL Server uses it, Docker deployment strategies in Azure, and when using Docker does and doesn't make sense.
