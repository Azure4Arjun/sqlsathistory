## Title: Spatial Analysis Jumpstart: Beyond Bubble charts 
## Abstract:
### Explore advanced spatial analysis techniques that are useful for combining existing spatial data with more traditional tabular data. You will learn how to leverage publicly available datasets with data that is internally created within your organization. Although the focus is on how the analysis techniques are applied to any industry, the demonstrations show specific cases, including health care, asset management, and earth science. Join us for a discussion where we'll explore the options available for visualizing the results and discuss the pros cons and limitations of each technology. You likely already have spatial data, this session shows you how to use it effectively.
