## Speaker: Steve Hood
## Title: Indexing Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### What are indexes and how does SQL Server use them?  Discuss the types of indexes that are available, and go in depth into heaps, clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes.  Why does SQL Server choose an index, and how does it make your queries run faster?  If you're a good fit to be in this session then columnstore, hash, and XML indexes aren't a good fit for you, so they will not get much more than an honorable mention.
