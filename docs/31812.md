## Title: Pivot Tables  Charts from T-SQL thru SharePoint
## Abstract:
### This session takes you from using the PIVOT command with simple SQL databases to building simple cubes in Analysis Services with related tables.  After using this cube to create a pivot table in SSAS, I will show how the Office Power User can take the same SQL tables and connect to them from excel with PowerPivot to create similar Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
