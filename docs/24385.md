## Title: Application Instrumentation 
## Abstract:
### In this session, we'll explore the key issues involved in instrumenting .NET applications to proactively drive production excellence using runtime information and supporting artifacts. We will cover development through post-deployment challenges and discuss requirement and implementation differences for both high and low volume application scenarios. As part of the process, we will work through a small framework with some of the concepts as a take away.
