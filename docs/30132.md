## Title: SSIS - Data Flow Buffer Breakdown
## Abstract:
### An advanced session which will attempt to break down areas of the data flow buffer.  In examining how the buffers are built and used, the user will begin to understand if, how and why package performance will be impacted when new transformations or columns are added.  The session will further take a look at the effects of parallel package and parallel task execution.
