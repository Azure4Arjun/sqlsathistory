## Title: New life for Reporting Services: what'up in 2016
## Abstract:
### During 2015 PASS Summit, Microsoft announced a roadmap to harmonize and standardize its BI reporting solutions into one unique hybrid scenario.
Reporting Services will play a crucial role in this new architecture. Starting from 2016 release, Reporting Services will be the Microsoft's on-premises solution for BI report delivery, meaning that it will host on-premises standard report as well as mobile report as well as Power BI Desktop report. 
To achieve this goal Reporting Services has been completely revisited and redesigned.

Come to this session to have a preview of the new features developed for Reporting Service with the advent of SQL Server 2016.
Your BI reporting strategy for the future could be completely revisited as you learn how many amazing changes are expected in the next future.
