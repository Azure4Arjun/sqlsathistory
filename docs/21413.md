## Title: Display Line of Business Data in SharePoint
## Abstract:
### The Business Connectivity Services (BCS) offered in SharePoint provides a robust way to integrate and display your Line of Business Data.  We will provide a full overview of the feature, show how it can be used to connect to different data sources, and then demonstrate the other advantages of using External Content Types instead of a custom developed report including lookup columns and search.  With this session, you will have the information needed to quickly and securely access your Line of Business data in SharePoint.
