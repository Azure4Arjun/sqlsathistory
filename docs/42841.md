## Title: Managing a Production Azure SQL Database - True Story!
## Abstract:
### I develop for and manage a small, but active, web application that lives completely inside of Azure from code to data. I've been involved with it since inception, and I've learned a few things about developing for, and managing data in this environment the hard way.

I'd like to share some of the lessons I've learned in hopes that it can save others some time.
