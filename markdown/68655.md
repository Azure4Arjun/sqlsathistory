## Speaker: Steve Rezhener
## Title: More than introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services aka SSRS
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will cover the Why and How of SSRS. We will briefly compare SSRS Report Manager/Portal vs. custom reporting development, go thru SSRS internals, and build one simple report from scratch. To spice up the session, we would also evaluate a code transparency technique and also build reports on reports or essentially SSRS on SSRS.
