## Title: Using Extended Events in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.
