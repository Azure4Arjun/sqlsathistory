## Title: A Primer on the Basics of NoSQL Databases
## Abstract:
### Think CouchDB is for DBA's who work from home? Or never heard about the wonderful job MongoDB does at deleting data?! Well now is your chance to get your feet wet and dive into MEAN development. In this presentation you'll get a tour of the MEAN Stack, a  crash course in some of the NoSQL flavors- CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis... and also see what Microsoft is doing with this new trend. Then we'll wrap up with a demonstration of working with Hadoop on Amazon's Web Services Cloud.
