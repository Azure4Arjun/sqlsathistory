## Speaker: Michelle Gutzait
## Title: Improve query performance with the new SQL Server 2016 query store!!
## Abstract:
### The Query Store feature maintains a history of query execution plans with their performance data, allowing you to quickly identify queries that are performing slower recently, allowing administrators or developers to force the use of an older, better plan if required. The Query Store is configured at the individual database level and not on the instance level.
This session will discuss the query store and what you can do on an ad-hoc basis or regularly.
