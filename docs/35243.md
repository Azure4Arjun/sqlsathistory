## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: ABCs of CTEs
## Abstract:
### Common Table Expressions (CTE) aren’t as common as their name implies.  CTEs are often seen as a secret part of the dark art of recursion.  This session will explore CTEs to show how they can be extremely useful in improving performance and legibility of T-SQL code.  And, of course, we will look at their use in returning recursive data.

Prerequisites
Understand of basic T-SQL coding
	
Goals:
Provide an understanding of the purpose and use of CTEs for recursion and derived tables
Define the pro’s and con’s to using CTEs in recursion and for derived tables
Demonstrate real-world examples detailing methods for using CTEs to solve coding challenges
