## Title: Choosing the right mobile BI tool: SSRS vs Power BI vs Datazen
## Abstract:
### In 2015 Microsoft carried out the release of Power BI and the acquisition of Datazen. 
During 2016 many changes are expected mostly regarding Reporting Services as a tool for contents repository and delivery. 
This means that now developers have a wide range of tools available for reporting, dashboarding, data analysis, both for desktop and mobile devices. So the question is: which one to choose? 
What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision? What changes are expected in the next future?
This session we'll focus on mobile BI reporting; we will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
You'll be able to see how to develop and deliver mobile BI reports with Reporting Services, Power BI and Datazen. 
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right reporting tool.
