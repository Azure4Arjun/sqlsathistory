## Title: Cosmos DB Develop Locally Deploy Globally
## Abstract:
### CosmosDB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, massively scalable, cloud based database that is hosted in AZURE.  Who cares?  You should if you need to support thousands of transactions a second, global distribution and redundancy, and different consistencies.  

Do you need to support JSON, Graph, et al?  Done.  Join me and see how easy it is to get started.  We will set up a local instance of CosmosDB, load JSON data and build a PowerBI visualization. Along the way I’ll point out a couple of things to watch out for.  At the end of the session you will then learn how, with a couple of commands, to switch your visualization to the cloud.
