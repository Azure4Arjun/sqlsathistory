## Title: SQL Server Performance Fundamentals: Building and Maintaining a Solid Foundation
## Abstract:
### Achieving great SQL Server performance can be elusive for new or "accidental" DBAs. For most production systems it starts with the right resources, correct configuration, and ongoing maintenance. In this session you will learn the basics of building and maintaining robust, healthy SQL Servers. 

At the end of this session you will know how to configure core server resources (disk, memory and cpu), which configuration settings are essential to good performance, the all-important role of tempdb, and walk away with a checklist to use  in your own SQL Server environment.
