## Title: Incremental ETL Processes with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Do you truncate and load your data every time you run your ETL processes? Do you want better performance out of your ETL processes? If you answered yes to either of those questions, this is your session.  We'll be discussing some of the evils and gotchas of the "trunc and load" ETL process, why incremental ETL processes are better overall, and we'll take a look at several different implementations of incremental ETL processes using SSIS both from a data quality and a performance perspective.
