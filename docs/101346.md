## Title: Power BI Time Intelligence - Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### Time-Intelligence refers to doing BI calculations across periods of time (usually dates), and is the most common type of analysis in business reporting. Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-to-Date (YTD), Prior-Month (PM), Prior-Year (PY), Month-over-Month (MoM), Year-over-Year (YoY) are all examples of Time-Intelligence calculations. There are many approaches to implementing time-intelligence into your Power BI solutions, including the use of built-in date tables and time-intelligence functions. In this session, we'll explore several of these approaches and the associated tradeoffs. We'll also learn about the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify more complex time-intelligence calculations. We'll also take the first step in mastering DAX by familiarizing ourselves with the CALCULATE function.
