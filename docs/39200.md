## Title: Develop your Database using “Database Projects” from SQL Server Data Tools
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Data Tools changes traditional database development by introducing a declarative, model-based experience that supports both online and offline (project-based) database development. In this presentation you will learn how to use this tool for either a new or existing database project.  We will also highlight and demonstrate key built-in features like refactoring, pre and post deployment scripts, publish, and schema compare.
