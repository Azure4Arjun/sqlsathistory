## Speaker: Jeremy Frye
## Title: PowerApps and AI: A Flow of Location Events
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft Power Platform has become an innovative bridge between data interaction, visualization, and analytics. The possibilities have become almost endless for businesses to engage with their data in amazing ways. 

In this session, we will dissect an application using Power Apps and location services to track latitude and longitude coordinates on Bing maps. Attendees will learn how to configure and demonstrate it on a mobile device.  I will also show two approaches using AI within the application by using Azure SQL Database, Cognitive Services and Power Automate.  An end-user will be able to leverage Bing Search for location-aware web searches, while an administrator will be able to leverage the Azure SQL Database and Power Automate to send alerts based on predefined metrics.
