## Title: Using Powershell to Manage Your Azure Databases
## Abstract:
### Moving your databases to the cloud by implementing Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse can be challenging. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that you simply don’t have as much tooling available to manage and maintain your databases. Enter Powershell. Through the use of Powershell you can much more easily maintain your Azure databases. Further, once you start using Powershell to maintain the databases, you’ll be able to automate a lot more processes within your Azure environment. This session will provide you with the core knowledge to create your own Powershell scripts and it will give you a set of foundation scripts from which you can build your own. You don’t have to feel limited on what you can do just because you’re on Azure. Powershell will empower you to get more done within your Azure database environment.
