## Title: Dive into the Default Trace
## Abstract:
### Beginning with SQL Server 2005 Microsoft included a Default Trace auditing many events.  This trace is used by many of the reports included with SSMS and can be mined for information about who has logged into your server, who created/changed/dropped objects, and much more!  Learn how to use this resource to audit and manage your SQL Servers!
