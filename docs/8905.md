## Title: Wait Stats: What are they and why you should care.
## Abstract:
### Many Application Support personnel, IT support, and even some DBA's are occasionally bombarded with "My application is slow", "the database keeps timing out", and many other end user complaints when supporting applications in any industry.  Instead of simply blaming it on the developers or simply brushing it off as a "vendor problem", wouldn't it be nice to understand the issues and notify the correct party?  This presentation is intended as a primer for wait stats.  Introducing the concepts, discussing why it's useful, then discussing a few ways that you can take this knowledge and apply it using a number of different approaches.  At the end I've also provided some examples of various LIVE environments I help manage so we can discuss what issues may or may not be prevalent.
