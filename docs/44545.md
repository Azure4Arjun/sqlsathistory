## Speaker: Peter ter Braake
## Title: DAX unraveled
## Abstract:
### DAX was created as an easier alternative for MDX with the introduction of PowerPivot. Multidimensional functionality with the look and feel of Excel functions and formulas. But the concept of context makes it more difficult than it might seem at a first glance. In this session we will learn to handle row-, query- and filter context by looking at a lot of practical examples.
