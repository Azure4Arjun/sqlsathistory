## Speaker: Rob Douglas
## Title: Demystifying Encryption
## Abstract:
### With the release of the GDPR regulations and similar global standards security is finally becoming the focus it always should have been.  Businesses are now able to put a number on how much a data breach will cost them...and that number is big enough to put many firms out of business.  
  In this session we'll talk about the various ways you can implement Encryptian natively within SQL Server - with Backup Encryption, Transparent Data Encryption(TDE), AlwaysEncrypted, and connection encryption

## Speaker: Shehab El-Najjar
## Title: T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers
## Abstract:
### To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)

Event Date: 03-08-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Martin Cairney
## Title: SQL Server Upgrades and Migrations - The Right Way
## Abstract:
### There has been lots of focus recently on upgrades and migrations with the end-of-life of SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2.

With so many critical databases running on these older versions, how do you ensure that you achieve a successful and safe transition to your new platform? Fortunately there are some fantastic tools and defined processes that can lead you through each stage. 

There are tools to test different versions and infrastructures, processes to track query regressions and provide a way to remediate them.

This session will walk through the upgrade process from end-to-end and show what tools can help you at each step.

# Secure multiparty Machine Learning with SQL Server Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-875)
Event Date: 03-08-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Stefano Tempesta
## Title: Secure multiparty Machine Learning with SQL Server Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves
## Abstract:
### Preserving privacy when processing data from multiple sources with machine learning is always a 
challenge. Organizations want to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets. Combining multiple data sources to support a better outcome improves accuracy of prediction, but it may come at cost of confidentiality, if sensitive information is not accurately protected.
SQL Server 2019 adds new data security capabilities with Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves. By using trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect your data while in use, you can use machine learning algorithms across different organizations to better train models, without revealing the processed data.
In this session, Stefano Tempesta, Microsoft Regional Director and MVP on AI and Business Application, will present the benefits of Confidential Computing in an ML scenario, where separate health institutes collaborate on data analysis and prediction using Azure ML.

# Automate your Machine Learning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-875)
Event Date: 03-08-2019 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Ajit Ananthram
## Title: Automate your Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### A typical machine learning experiment involves the following phases - data preparation, algorithm selection, model training, model testing and hyperparameter tuning. The process is usually repeated for a range of machine learning algorithms and then the most optimum model is selected for scoring. This model needs to be exposed to client applications – in SQL Server the model can stored in a table and then wrapped in a stored procedure, while models built using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn can be exposed through REST APIs.

The machine learning lifecycle is iterative and often time-consuming. What if there was a way to automate some of the processes involved so that the outcome could be generated sooner? In this session, you will see Automated Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure in action. You’ll get to learn key concepts and takeaway enough knowledge to be able to run simple machine learning experiments.

## Speaker: Patrick Flynn
## Title: Get Comfortable with Query tuning and Execution Plans
## Abstract:
### Even as many of the traditional DBA activities become automated or managed by Cloud providers, the ability to tune and optimize database query performance remains a desirable and marketable skill.

Central to ability to tune queries is an ability to use information provided from Execution plans, DMVs, Query Store and Extended Events.

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.
