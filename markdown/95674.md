## Title: Top Tips for Deploying AGs and FCIs On Premises or In the Cloud
## Abstract:
### There are three main ways to deploy Always On Availability Groups (AGs) and Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs) - physical hardware, virtualized, and IaaS in the public cloud. Starting with SQL Server 2017, we now also have the ability to use Windows Server or Linux. While some things are the same, each of the possible permutations and combinations affect how you plan, deploy, and administer AGs and FCIs. This session cuts right to the chase and will give you top tips and tricks for successfully deploying and administering AGs and FCIs so you can be an availaility hero no matter where you are deploying or what operating system you are using.
