## Speaker: Mike Huguet
## Title: Sharing and Reuse with PowerShell Advanced Functions and Modules
## Abstract:
### Many people have dabbled in PowerShell or have solid experience leveraging it in the workplace, but do you have an understanding of how to simplify future use of your scripts or to fully share your scripts with others on your team or across the organization?  In this session we will create advanced functions, convert them to cmdlets, create our own module and then use them.  Along the way, we will also learn how to support the pipeline, properly document and leverage parameter options.  This is an intermediate/advanced session that assumes you are comfortable with PowerShell and have at least a basic understanding of creating functions.
