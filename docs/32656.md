## Title: Dynamic Text File Creation Via Single SSIS Package
## Abstract:
### Creating individual SSIS Packages for individual business-to-business data files is not only time consuming, but becomes a maintenance nightmare.  This presentation will show you how to create a single SSIS package that can generate varying length and formatted text files.  By utilizing stored procedures and executing dynamic T-SQL you will see how the time from specification to file delivery can be greatly reduced and simplified.  Additional areas we will cover include the support tables to control file run times, creating file variables at run time, and how to report file success.
