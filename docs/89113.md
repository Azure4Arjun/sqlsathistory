## Title: Power BI gets 'smarter': infuse more AI and ML into your BI processes
## Abstract:
### Power BI gets better every day. In addition to supporting R and Python, it gets more AI/ML features ready to use with very little effort - either right 'out-of-box' or as a result of easy integration with relevant Azure services. And this is just the beginning since Microsoft has recently assigned a dedicated AI team to enhance AI capabilities in Power BI so we should expect much more in coming months.
During the session I will describe the Power BI ecosystem and AI/ML in general. Then we will discuss existing and new 'out-of-box' AI features which are easy to use. I hope it will help you to master 'smarter' approaches and help to start exploring and applying predictive analyses to your processes. Stop only asking questions like 'What happened?' - start asking new new type of questions like 'What will happen next?'. Achieve more by using AI-infused features like QA, Insights and Web search by example.
