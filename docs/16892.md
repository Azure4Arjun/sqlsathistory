## Title: Introduction to Execution Plans  Query Tuning
## Abstract:
### There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is under-performing, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. The Query Optimizer, Execution Plans  Query Tuning are the three key topics covered. At the end of the session you will walk away with the confidence to diagnose and tune queries.
