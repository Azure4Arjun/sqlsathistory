## Speaker: Pedro Reis
## Title: "DAX" the way to do it
## Abstract:
### Love it or hate it, you just can't ignore DAX. In this session I'll show you it's true power and how by knowing it you can even completely rethink your data modelling!

Many times data models are configured in a way that the formulas which are applied to it are simple and fast to calculate. But with the Power of DAX, you can now achieve much more sophisticated and powerful calculations, while keeping it simple at the same time. And by knowing DAX, you can also plan your models in a better way just by leaving it up to DAX.

In this session you will learn:
- Handling different granularities
- Handling multiple factuals in the same model
- Calculations with disconnected tables
- Advanced Time intelligence
- Multiple formulas and tricks
