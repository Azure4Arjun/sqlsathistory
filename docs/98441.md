## Speaker: Thomas Martens
## Title: DAX - Musings about foundational concepts
## Abstract:
### Selected questions from the Power BI community (https://community.powerbi.com) will be discussed. All these questions are touching foundational concepts ranging from table iterator functions like SUMX, but also the scope of variables will be addressed. These questions provide some additional and unusual perspectives to some common and not so common problems.
Each question comes with its own slides documenting the underlying concepts and a separate PBIX file using additional explaining measures.
