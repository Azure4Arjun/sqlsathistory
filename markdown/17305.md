## Title: SQL Server 2012 Analytic Functions
## Abstract:
### Windowing functions were first introduced in SQL Server 2005 when the ranking functions were added. SQL Server 2012 offers analytic functions that greatly simplify the coding of complex problems. Using analytic functions, aggregations can be easily and painlessly combined with row level details. FIRST_VALUE, RANGE, LEAD, and LAG introduce new ways of thinking about and solving problems. We'll go through the data and the new operators to reduce formerly complex queries to simpler ones.
