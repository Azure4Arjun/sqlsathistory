## Title: ASP.NET Web API
## Abstract:
### In recent years, the WCF team at Microsoft has released multiple REST services, while the ASP.NET team has helped developers build basic APIs by allowing JSON to be returned from MVC controllers. ASP.NET Web API is a joint effort by both teams to provide a single RESTful API framework.  This session will cover the basics of how to use ASP.NET Web API to build simple HTTP services.  We will start with a new MVC 4 project and build a functional API that can be consumed by numerous clients in order to query and manipulate data from the host.

# MicroORMs:Data Access That Won't Make Your DBA Cry
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#150---Baton-Rouge-2012)
Event Date: 04-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: .net 2
## Speaker: Brian Sullivan
## Title: MicroORMs:Data Access That Won't Make Your DBA Cry
## Abstract:
### Modern ORMs like NHibernate and Entity Framework are powerful, flexible tools that are the right choice for many projects. But they feel like overkill for that little internal app with three tables and one screen. And even after a ton of tuning, the SQL they produce for that massive screen in your mission-critical enterprise app can be abysmal. It turns out that both of these problems might have the same answer: a Micro ORM. These lightweight tools leverage the power of dynamic typing and other advanced .NET framework features to give you a simple way to get your data that's also easy to optimize. Brian will give an overview of the various tools available, and dive deep into PetaPoco to show you how powerful these little frameworks can be.

# AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#150---Baton-Rouge-2012)
Event Date: 04-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: SQL DBA 1
## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: SQL Server 2012 Database Engine – Why Upgrade?
## Abstract:
### There seems to be lots of buzz about AlwaysOn (new high availability \ disaster recovery feature) and new BI features in SQL Server 2012. But, what else do you need to be aware of specifically for the database engine to make your case for upgrading? This session will provide an overview of changes to the installation process, enhancements for manageability (PowerShell updates, new DMVs and T-SQL functions), updates to security features and more! You’ll leave this session with a list of SQL Server 2012 features to help you develop your upgrade justification.

## Title: SSIS for ETL in the Enterprise Environment
## Abstract:
### Design walkthrough of an ETL solution developed using the Microsoft SSIS system for an enterprise level Data Warehouse.  Managing the ETL process migration from a single data warehousing SQL Server to a multi-server environment can often be a complex task.  This session will walk you through the design of a ETL system that has been created for such a scenario.  The design takes into consideration several of the shortcomings inherent in the SSIS system and provides a structure for coordinated loading and processing of data from extraction to presentation.

## Abstract:
### The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell.  Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell.  This session will take you from nothing  and explain what powershell is all about.  I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else.  So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.

## Title: The Backup Tune-up
## Abstract:
### Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups and I’ve had great success.

# Unit Testing - Solving some Tough Issues

Event Date: 04-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: .net 1
## Speaker: Steve Schaneville
## Title: Unit Testing - Solving some Tough Issues
## Abstract:
### Unit Tests are common place in our tools for creating quality code.  However, we still run into several road blocks that often prevent us from writing a thorough suite of tests.  This session will suggest ways of solving 2 specific problems that I have personally experienced when trying to write suites of unit tests.  Specifically, I'll attempt to address:

* how to write test for older code libraries that do not currently have unit tests so that the code can be changed with confidence (a look at the new Fakes framework in VS 2012).
* how to write tests for logic/data access code that uses Entity Framework without hiding the flexiblilty of Entity Framework (note, I actually don't prefer the repository pattern).
