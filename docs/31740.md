## Title: Build a Data Warehouse in Less than 1 Hour
## Abstract:
### You’ve heard that you need one of these things.  You spend all of your time trying to figure out what all of these new-fangled terms mean and now you don’t have time to build one.  In this session, we’ll clear away all of the clutter of the technobabble aka acronym soup aka latest and greatest techno-term to sell you stuff and get back to the basics of building something that you can use.  You’ll learn why you should build a warehouse, what it does for you, and how you go about building one without needing a year, 40 people, and a 7 digit budget.  We’ll go from transactional database to data warehouse that can be used in less than 1 hour.
