## Speaker: Vanessa Larsen
## Title: Deciphering the Black Box - Why productivity projects crash and burn
## Abstract:
### Like a building a bridge that collapses within days of its grand opening (if it even gets finished at all), sometimes our digital projects don't go the way we expect. Productivity initiatives are particularly fickle as we try to change the way that people work. So how do we make sure we can successfully become a digital workplace without it all coming crashing down around our ears?

In this session, we will share our stories from our time in the field experiencing the twists and turns that productivity projects take; how to have success in your internal project; and if you choose to bring in external parties, how to make the most of them.
