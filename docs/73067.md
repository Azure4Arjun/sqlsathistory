## Title: Azure Data Lake for First Time Swimmers
## Abstract:
### Data Lake may be the hot new way to store data for reporting, but few people have actually worked with it. If you have no idea what a data lake is, have no fear! You will get an intro to the concept of data lake and what scenarios you should be considering it as your platform. From there youâ€™ll get to see how Azure Data Lake Analytics and USQL allow developers and data professionals to create compelling analytics with data that previously was hard to work with.
