## Title: The Significance of Choosing and Using Data Types
## Abstract:
### It's an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. My goals in this presentation are to show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for proper usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of imappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition, I will cover serveral data type related functions and point out caveates in their usage.
