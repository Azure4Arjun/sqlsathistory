## Title: Securing and Managing access to your DW data
## Abstract:
### Managing who is able to access and retrieve data in your database is paramount to an organization.  How do we protect data from prying eyes, or individuals whose roles simply do not and should not have access to certain data?  We will look at techniques to secure and restrict access, and release of data to those who should receive it.  Taking real life scenarios, we will apply row level security, dynamic data masking, database roles, schemas, security groups, and other considerations to manage secure and manage access to your data.
