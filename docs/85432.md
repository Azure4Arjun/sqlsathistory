## Title: Azure database perfomance by dbWatch AS
## Abstract:
### The popular image of cloud services is both attractive and enticing. You get access to an unlimited amount of hardware at a reasonable price. Your systems can run seamlessly and at peak performance anywhere in the world, and It is natural to assume that the performance of cloud services is identical and stable, regardless of whether itâ€™s located in Asia, Europe or North America
To confirm if this is really the case or not, we conducted two tests periods in Azure. One in December 2016 and one in March 2018. Three Service tiers were tested: Basic 5 DTU, Standard S3 100 DTU and Premium P2 250 DTU. The tests have been done at three locations: West Europe, West Japan and West US.

We will present the test methods and harness uses, and the results and findings.

Based on our measurements we have seen:
- Significant variations in performance between the different geographical locations
- Significant variations in performance for the same database at different times
- Surprisingly poor
