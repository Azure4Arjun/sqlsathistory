## Title: Whipping Away Stress
## Abstract:
### Did you know stress releases chemicals into the blood? These chemicals give more energy and strength, which can be a positive if the stress is caused by physical danger. But this can also be a negative, if the stress is in response to something emotional and there is no way to release the extra energy and strength. Need stress management techniques? Stressed out? Learn how to cope and ultimately whip stress away.
