## Title: PowerPivot:  BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
## Abstract:
### The paradox of Business Intelligence:  it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor.  Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us.  Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow?

In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications).  The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :)

I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)
