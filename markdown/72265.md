## Title: Grokking the Grammar of Graphics
## Abstract:
### One of the most popular libraries in R is ggplot2, a graphics library built on a concept called the grammar of graphics.  In this example-heavy talk, we will learn about the grammar of graphics through ggplot2.  We will start by building a series of simple visuals using ggplot2.  Then, we will show how easy it is to add more and more complex functionality to our visuals, showing that we can incrementally add polish to our visuals.  By the end of the talk, you will have the tools to build professional-quality visuals in R.
