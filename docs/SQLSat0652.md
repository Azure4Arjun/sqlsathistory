# Replacing Institutional Knowledge with Artificial Intelligence so I can Take a Damned Vacation
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#652---Atlanta-2017)
Event Date: 15-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Analytics  Visualization
## Speaker: Jim Christopher
## Title: Replacing Institutional Knowledge with Artificial Intelligence so I can Take a Damned Vacation
## Abstract:
### A lot of my job involves leveraging knowledge that only I possess. Anecdotal stuff and volatile-state-of-the-data stuff that gets updated several times a day and is almost entirely in my own head. Taking vacations kind of sucks because that institutional knowledge travels with me, and no one is able to pick up my slack. All of my peers in the organization are in the same predicament.

Recently though, we've been capturing this institutional knowledge in small artificial intelligences. These systems act in an advisory capacity, routinely automating many of the research and state checks that we need to do our jobs.  These systems make us more productive, more collaborative, and enable some luxurious time away from the desk.

In this session, you'll learn how we identified the candidates for "micro-AIs," how easy these systems were to implement using freely available tools, and gain some of our hard-won insight into balancing automated AI and human decision-making.

# Use Visual Studio Code to Access SQL Server from Windows (or Mac, or Linux, or ...)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#652---Atlanta-2017)
Event Date: 15-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Eric Flamm
## Title: Use Visual Studio Code to Access SQL Server from Windows (or Mac, or Linux, or ...)
## Abstract:
### "Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas."

Need a quick peek at your SQL Server database but don't want to wait for SSMS to start up? Need to run T-SQL queries from a 32-bit Windows 7 box? Working on a MacBook and don't want to switch to Windows just to run a quick SQL script? Time to try Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a free, open source code editor and IDE from Microsoft built on the Electron project which runs on most popular desktop and mobile systems and starts and executes FAST! Even better, it's extensible - using the MSSQL extension gives users access to stored connection strings, T-SQL for DDL and CRUD queries, and more. This session will demo install and use cases.

# Performance Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#652---Atlanta-2017)
Event Date: 15-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Dev, Delivery  Admin
## Speaker: Shabnam Watson
## Title: Performance Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
## Abstract:
### SSAS Servers need maintenance and monitoring post deployment to production; however, when projects forgo this part the overall system performance can suffer. Just like every SQL Server requires a DBA to maintain it, every SSAS server needs a SSAS administrator. 
This session introduces you to SSAS administration beyond the initial development of a database. You will learn what to measure and how to determine acceptable ranges of those measurements for your environment. Demos will be used to show you how to use Task Manager, Perfmon and SQL Server Extended Events to get insights into a SSAS server’s health, identify the most common issues with a server in production, and make recommendations for changes to SSAS developers on your team.
If you have experience with SSAS development and are interested in learning about SSAS from the sever side, this session is for you. The focus of this session will be on SSAS multidimensional; however, many of the concepts apply to SSAS Tabular as well.

## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

## Title: Query Store – What is it all about?
## Abstract:
### SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.

## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. Women are penalized. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

## Title: Leveraging SQL Server R Services to Perform Advanced Analytics
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is packed with many great features. One of those features is the integration of R in SQL Server via SQL Server R Services. This integration gives us the ability to perform very sophisticated analytics against data inside the database and data warehoused in big data environments such as Spark  Hadoop. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to productionize models developed by your data scientist via SQL Server R Services. I will demonstrate how to manage the whole process using an IDE that many of us have grown to love, Visual Studio.

# How to Move a Ton of Data from the Mainframe to the Cloud (with B
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#652---Atlanta-2017)
Event Date: 15-07-2017 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Dev, Delivery  Admin
## Speaker: Simon Kingaby
## Title: How to Move a Ton of Data from the Mainframe to the Cloud (with B
## Abstract:
### So you need to move data from 75 tables on the mainframe to new tables in SQL Azure.  Do you: a) hand code one package to load all 75 tables, b) hand code 75 packages that move a table each, or c) wish there was a better way?
There is!  Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) can automate the creation of packages so that they all follow the same script.  In this beginner level session, we will create some simple metadata to be able to generate multiple packages and their associated connection managers.  You will see Biml in action.  You will see the XML that Biml uses to define packages and connections.  You will see the C# code that Biml uses to fetch metadata and dynamically generate packages in SSIS. And you will see packages and connection managers generated from Biml before your very eyes.

## Title: VLDB Tips and Migration Tactics
## Abstract:
### Are your databases growing? Most likely they are but what do you have to do differently when they reach VLDB (>1TB) in size? I currently manage and have recently migrated terabyte sized databases (~30TB) to SQL Server 2016. In this session, people will learn how they need to change their thinking when it comes to bread and butter DBA tasks like daily and weekly maintenance, patching, restores and monitoring. I will also share many lessons learned and strategies from migrating from an older version of SQL Server to a newer version like SQL Server 2016. Afterwards people will have a greater sense of confidence that they too can manage and migrate VLDB(s).

## Title: Execution Plans for Mere Mortals
## Abstract:
### For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.

## Title: Agile isn't the A in DBA, but you still should know it
## Abstract:
### Backlogs! Standups! Burndowns! If you ever find yourself - as a data professional - immersed in an organization that follows an agile methodology, you're going to want to have a basic understanding of typical roles, artifacts, events, and nomenclature associated with that methodology. In this session, you'll get a quick overview of agile methodologies (focusing on Scrum) and how they apply to the way data professionals work as part of a software development team. You'll leave with an understanding of the goals that agile methodologies try to achieve, resources to learn more, and confidence in knowing a PBI from a PBR.
