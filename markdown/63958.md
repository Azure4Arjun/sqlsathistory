## Title: Things I Learned the Hard Way About Azure Data Platform Services So That You Don't Have To
## Abstract:
### "I feel like I've been sent back to 2005" - me after getting into my first Azure Data Factory Project.  Azure Data Platform services such as Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse are new and exciting and continually being enhanced. But there are several things that exist in the more mature SQL Server product that are lacking or just different in Azure. That doesn't mean you should avoid Azure. But it does mean you will need to think about how to solve problems differently and use different design patterns. I'll share some things that took me a while to understand, some funny quirks in these Azure services, and some lessons learned from real implementations to help you get up to speed, understand their strengths, and avoid banging your head against a wall.
