## Speaker: Howard Diesel
## Title: SQL Skills: Senior In Age / Pay OR Skills
## Abstract:
### This is not for those that are "Gettings Things Done" and already know the "End Game". It is also not for those that are not interested in Professional Development discussions and just want to listen to hard-core technical.
It is for those that appreciate being challenged in where they are currently in their professional career and where they are going.
It does try to address the decisions "ground rules" required to becoming a "Senior SQL Rockstar" without any regrets and blank spaces in your resume.
