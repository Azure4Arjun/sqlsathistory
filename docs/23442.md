## Speaker: Ronald Dameron
## Title: Real World SQL Server Administration with just a bit of sysadmin
## Abstract:
### It is becoming increasingly difficult to allow SQL Server database administrators to retain sysadmin permission 24x7x365 on production servers due to IT Security, Audit, and Compliance concerns.

This session will review the fundamentals needed  to define a configurable permission model that allows your companyâ€™s DBAs to do routine work without them having unfettered access to business data.  Several demonstrations will prove that many DBA tasks can be done without sysadmin access. Attendees will also learn how to deploy a permission model that allows DBAs to do routine work, elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies and how to grant sysadmin permissions during disaster recovery scenarios. Scripts will be reviewed and demonstrated that secure the database server and that can undo the permission model in case of unforeseen circumstances.
