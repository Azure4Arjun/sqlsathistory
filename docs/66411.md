## Title: High Availability with SQL Server 2017 on Linux
## Abstract:
### Most database administrators know how to manage and deploy high availability solutions using SQL Server. Most also know parts of Windows clustering. But with SQL Server 2017 there is a old new kid on the block and it is called Linux. The SQL part might be the same, the operating system is certainly not. In this session we will take a look at high availability solutions on Linux and how they fit into SQL Server. How do you manage and deploy availability groups across your organization leveraging Linux. But also, what is new with SQL Server 2017 on Linux as well as Windows.
