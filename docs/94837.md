## Title: Linked Servers - Creating, and Using
## Abstract:
### Linked servers in SQL have been around for a very long time, but still can cause lots of headache when configuring one for use.  In this session, we will dive in the the multiple creation, security, and configuration options that can be so important to making them work successfully.  In the last part, we will cover the different syntax available over linked servers and when best to use one over the other, with some real life examples.
