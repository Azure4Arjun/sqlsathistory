## Title: Break it up!  Implement Table Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Stuck with some huge, monolithic  tables?  Thought about aging out and archiving some of the data?  This presentation covers the basics of table partitioning and why it might be the right solution for your database.  There is a useful demo on implementing a sliding window approach for aging out data using a date partition column.  We will also cover some performance considerations and maintenance tasks relevant to partitioning.
