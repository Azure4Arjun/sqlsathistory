## Title: PrequelSaturday - How the SQL Server community is about to make your job easier
## Abstract:
### Welcome! You've already discovered the best value anywhere in SQL training; here's how to make the most of it. We'll talk about what to do while you're here and ways to keep up the learning momentum afterward.

You'll also be introduced to several invaluable (and not just because they're free) tools that anyone working with SQL Server needs to be familiar with.

If you're new to SQL Server, when you get back to work on Monday you'll know how to attack the problem you've been struggling with, you'll solve the next problem faster, and you'll know how to find help if you get stuck. Oh, and you'll know about six other problems that used to be hiding from you.
