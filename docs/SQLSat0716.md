# Faster SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#716-New-York-City-2018)
Event Date: 19-05-2018 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: Faster SSIS
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

# Using Powershell to Manage Your Azure Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#716-New-York-City-2018)
Event Date: 19-05-2018 - Session time: 15:50:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Using Powershell to Manage Your Azure Databases
## Abstract:
### Moving your databases to the cloud by implementing Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse can be challenging. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that you simply don’t have as much tooling available to manage and maintain your databases. Enter Powershell. Through the use of Powershell you can much more easily maintain your Azure databases. Further, once you start using Powershell to maintain the databases, you’ll be able to automate a lot more processes within your Azure environment. This session will provide you with the core knowledge to create your own Powershell scripts and it will give you a set of foundation scripts from which you can build your own. You don’t have to feel limited on what you can do just because you’re on Azure. Powershell will empower you to get more done within your Azure database environment.

## Speaker: Jerod Johnson
## Title: SQL Integration Hubs - Bridge Cloud and On-Premise Data Connectivity
## Abstract:
### As data has become increasingly vital to core businesses, it has also become more decentralized than ever. Integrating with disparate data presents its own set of challenges, with varying solutions dependent upon your environment and platform.
A Linked Server is a feature of Microsoft SQL Server that allows users to execute federated queries that combine data stored in SQL Server with other linked data sources, whether that is remote SQL Server instances or other databases with ODBC connectivity. Such connections are typically configured using the OLE DB Provider.
With the CData SQL Broker, users can create a Linked Server based on any of the 100+ CData ODBC Drivers and see improved performance, smarter complex query management, and more flexible installation options as compared to using the OLE DB Provider. In this talk, we will discuss the use of Linked Servers, compare the capabilities of Linked Servers created using the OLE DB Provider and CData SQL Broker, and demonstrate creati

### Power Query is a great tool for extracting, transforming, and loading data.  It has an intuitive interface that allows you to create queries without having to worry about writing code. Under the covers Power Query is creating the M code that gets executed. In this session we will pull back the covers to reveal and understand the M code that is being created. This will give you greater insight into how to debug your queries. In addition, we will look at creating advance queries that go beyond what is available using the Power Query user interface.

## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

# Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization

## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
## Abstract:
### Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Title: Developing AI applications using CNTK Deep Learning
## Abstract:
### While human-like deductive reasoning, inference, and decision-making by a computer is still a long time away. But, there have been remarkable gains in the application of AI techniques and associated algorithms when used to solve real-world problems. One such AI technique that can be leveraged effectively to solve problems is Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by, and partially modeled on biological neural networks called artificial neural networks. 
The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is a free, easy-to-use, open-source, commercial-grade toolkit that trains deep learning algorithms to learn like the human brain. This session is meant to explain high level concepts of AI, deep learning, and neural networks using CNTK at a level that can be understood by most non-practitioners.

## Title: Using Azure blob storage for staging data
## Abstract:
### Abstract:

Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  How can IT professionals help business lines gather and process data from various sources? 

There have been two schools of thought when dealing with big data.  

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database.  Raw data is ingested by an extract, transform and load (ETL) process.  The data is stored in tables that enforce integrity and allow for quick retrieval. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database. 

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase that  assumed that data integrity was applied during the generation of the text files.  The actual definition of the table is applied during the read operation.  All the data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Coverage:

1 - Saving files to blob storage.
2 - How to bulk insert data into Azure DB
3 - Using PolyBase to load an Azure DW
4 - Azure Automation
