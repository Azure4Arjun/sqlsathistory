## Speaker: Jacques Mostert
## Title: Data has "R" value
## Abstract:
### Many companies take data for granted, and see it as a liability instead of an asset. In this session we will discuss some of the elements of how you can start to measure the “cost” of your data and if that data was lost what would it cost the company to recover. Your companies data must be a measurable asset.
