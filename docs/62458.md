## Title: Azure Cosmos DB – Does this change the game?
## Abstract:
### In this session, we discuss the newly announced Azure Cosmos DB - Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database.  Azure Cosmos DB was announced on May 10th, 2017, during the Microsoft BUILD conference.  Azure Cosmos DB is a superset of the Azure DocumentDB – offering a write optimized, resource governed, schema-agnostic database engine that natively supports multiple data models: key-value, documents, graphs, and columnar. It also supports many APIs for accessing data including MongoDB, DocumentDB SQL, Gremlin (preview), and Azure Tables (preview), in an extensible manner.  Let’s take a look at Azure Cosmos DB and how it impacts the game.
