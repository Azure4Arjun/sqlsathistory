## Title: Intelligent Infrastructure for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Every day we are expected to do more and more work with less resources.  The future shows this trend will continue.  Writing scripts to do automation will only get us so far.  Gartner Group has created a new category called Intelligent Infrastructure in 2017 and many infrastructure vendors and software companies are doing more and more in this space.  This session will explain what Intelligent Infrastructure is, what AIOps is, what is available now and what is coming and how the DBA can utilize these new tools to improve their daily workflow.  Free up your time to focus on bigger strategic problems for your organization.
