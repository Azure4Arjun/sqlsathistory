## Speaker: Bob Pusateri
## Title: Back It Up Faster!
## Abstract:
### Backups: You can't live without them but want them to complete as quickly as possible. The faster they're done, the sooner your server's CPU and IO resources can get back to their normal job of servicing queries. 

Queries aren't the only part of SQL Server you can tune for maximum performance - backups fall under this category as well. This session will discuss how backups work and how you can capitalize on this knowledge to ensure they complete as quickly as possible. Cutting your backup (and restore) times by 50% or more is not out of the question when using these methods.
