## Title: The DBA Quit and Now You're It: Action Plan
## Abstract:
### The only DBA at your company just quit and your boss storms into your office and says "You do data stuff, right? You're our new DBA!" Congratulations, I guess? You may have been a report developer or data developer but you're a DBA now too - what should you do? Join me as we walk through a checklist for your first few days as a DBA. We'll make sure the security basics are handled, we'll make sure backups and maintenance are squared away, we'll make sure you know and understand how your server is performing, and we'll make sure this accidental promotion becomes a path to learning and growth and not sleepless nights and panic attacks.
