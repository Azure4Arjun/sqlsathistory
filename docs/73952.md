## Title: Data Visualization with D3.js
## Abstract:
### The goal of this presentation is to introduce attendees to D3.js, Javascript's premiere library for data visualization.  Iâ€™ll showcase prominent examples of D3.js in action (e.g. NYTimes, Netflix, etc.), explain how it works and where it exists in the ecosystem of data visualization tools, as well as walk through the creation process and iterative design of a data visualization via a live-coding demo.
