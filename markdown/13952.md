## Title: Scale-out scenarios with Transactional Replication
## Abstract:
### Transactional Replication exists in SQL Server since 1995; It's an stable solution, reliable and scalable 
if it's used properly. Obviously is not a solution for everything so you will have to decide wether this technology
fits for your needs or not. In this session we will introduce the main concepts about transactional replication and two real cases to show the scale-out benefits
of this technology. At the end we will talk about common best practices for transactional replication.
