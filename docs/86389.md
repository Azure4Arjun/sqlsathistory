## Title: Become a SQL Ninja: SQL Server Tools
## Abstract:
### In this session I will walk through some of the out-of-box SQL Server tools that you will need to know or never knew could be so much fun. A number of commandline utilities exist with SQL Server that we are never exposed to. In this session, I will take a tour of each of these tools and the scenarioâ€™s that real world customers used them in innovative ways. From SQL Server Management Studio to every tools will be an hour of Demo extravaganza not to be missed. This is a Zero slide but an hour of demo marathon.
