## Title: Metadata Driven SSIS With Biml
## Abstract:
### The power of BimlScript is amplified by the availability of rich metadata to drive the automation of your SSIS solution.  Peter will demonstrate a flexible and reusable framework for storing and managing the metadata that you will use as an input to your BimlScripts. The framework demonstrated will be made available to all attendees and can be used with the free BidsHelper Visual Studio add in.
