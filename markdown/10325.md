## Title: Defeating the Limitations of the Query Optimizer
## Abstract:
### Query optimizers are highly complex pieces of software, which even after 40 years of research, still face several technical challenges in some fundamental areas. As a result, there may be cases when even after you've provided the query optimizer with all the information it needs, you still donâ€™t get an efficient execution plan for your queries. This session will show you the current challenges and limitations of query optimizers in general and the SQL Server query optimizer in particular, along with solutions or workarounds to avoid each of these problems.
