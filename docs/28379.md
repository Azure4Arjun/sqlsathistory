## Title: Quickly Gather Performance Data with PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Continuously gathering performance data to log history and developing a performance baseline is a really important task in any environment.  Having quick access to what’s happening right now is equally important.  In this session we’ll take a look at how to continuously gather Perfmon counters and DMV info.  We’ll also take a look at how to Visualize the data using charts.
