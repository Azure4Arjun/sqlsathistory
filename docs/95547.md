## Title: Introduction into SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2019 allows you to deploy a scalable cluster of SQL Server, HDFS and Spark in Kubernetes. It brings you new capabilities to integrate structured and non-structured data, create data virtualization on top of it and integrate AI with it. Sounds amazing, right?
Join me in this session and I show you how it is easy to deploy this cluster and start using it, capabilities it provides and how to manage it. We also review some use cases that are relevant to this solution.
