## Title: Pushing Data to a Web Client Using Comet
## Abstract:
### Pushing data to a web client over HTTP has always been a hassle. There are ways to do it using Flash or Silverlight, but they all require  a component and/or separate install on the client as well as obscuring the semantic value of the data. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just use Plain Old Semantic HTML (POSH) and regular JavaScript to simplify client requirements? Comet (aka long-polling) allows you to open a channel to the client and push data from the server down asynchronously. This session will walk you through the Comet architecture using .NET and JQuery to push POSH or JSON data to a web client in a performant and scalable way.
