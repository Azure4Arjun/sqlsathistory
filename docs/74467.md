## Title: Practical Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered how an AI solution is built?  In this session we will demystify the process and walk through how machine learning can be applied to solve a real-world problem. 

Starting from a multi-year dataset of thousands of mechanical devices, we’ll review and explain the steps it took to build a machine learning model that is able to predict when a device is about to fail.  Specifically we’ll cover: 
* What is AI and Machine Learning?
* Defining the problem
* Feature Engineering
* Model Selection
* Model Training and Evaluation
* Production Considerations

While the use case we will cover was implemented in R, our focus will be on the overall process so you can take what you’ve learned an apply it to your toolset of choice.  You’ll leave with a better understanding what AI is and how machine learning works.
