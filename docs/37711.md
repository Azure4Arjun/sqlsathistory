## Title: Staying Afloat in the .NET Asynchronous Ocean
## Abstract:
### In this session we will walk through the history of Asynchronous programming in .NET and discuss the pros and cons of the wide range of options that are available in the framework.  Many examples will be shown with a focus on the modern options, such as the Task Parallel Library and the async keyword.  The goal of this session is for you to gain a better understanding of when to use certain options and when not.
