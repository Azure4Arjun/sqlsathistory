## Speaker: Pat Wright
## Title: Are all RDBMS systems created equally?
## Abstract:
### We all love SQL Server but is it really so much different than Postgres, Oracle or Mysql?  I've spent a lot of years in many of these technologies and I want people to understand the good and the bad about the different technologies out there.  My goal with this session is to entertain and to hopefully open your eyes to the reality that if you have skills and knowledge of RDBMS you shouldn't be afraid of ever finding a job in any of these technologies.
