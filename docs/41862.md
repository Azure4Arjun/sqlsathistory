## Title: Enforce Best Practices with CMS and Policy Based Management
## Abstract:
### You have a lot of servers and need to make sure you have consistent settings configured like disabling auto shrink, disabling extended stored procedures, or enabling database mail.  I'll show you how to check those settings across all your servers with Central Management Server and how you can manage a disperse environment.  You will learn how to leverage the power of Policy Based Management to enforce those settings and standards in your enterprise.  Best of all, you will see how to get alerts sent to you when one of your settings is changed.
