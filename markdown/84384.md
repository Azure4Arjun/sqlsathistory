## Title: Development  Test Data Management: Achieving breakthrough saving
## Abstract:
### An estimated 2,000 new applications are released daily yet, the demand for new applications is increasing. Resulting in enterprises that lack sufficient resources to meet demand. Costly storage, compute and licenses required to maintain multiple copies of production databases are scarce. Delays in development cycles result as developers wait for DBAs, who in turn wait for storage administrators to provision the required space. The business suffers as project delays lead to deferred revenue or customer service impact. Actifio virtualizes production system data, delivering instant, non-disruptive access for application development and test without the need for additional storage. Virtually multiplying the output of a production environment, while simultaneously reducing costs. This session will provide an understanding of how to utilize Actifio for application development and test
data automation to reduce application development cycle time, reduce costs and eliminate production impact.
