## Title: Database Unit Testing made Easy
## Abstract:
### Though most developers agree that unit testing plays an important role in software development, to ensure quality  meet milestones, most developers write unit tests only as an afterthought. VSTS helps to mainstream Test Driven Development methodology (TDD) into world of database development. In this session, we will not only cover the basis of unit testing concepts and terminology, but also discuss how unit testing helps ensure and document the quality and accuracy of database deliverables. We will run through a demo of creating and running database unit tests using VSTS 2012, as well as upgrading from VSTS2010 database and unit test projects.
