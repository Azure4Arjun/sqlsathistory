# Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.

# It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system-maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 08:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

# DevOps for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: DevOps for the DBA
## Abstract:
### DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.

## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
## Abstract:
### We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

# Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.

## Speaker: Davide Mauri
## Title: Serverless Computing: Azure Functions, Logic Apps and Azure SQL and CosmosDB
## Abstract:
### Serverless is all about allowing us to focus only on the business problem we have to solve, removing all complexity related to infrastructure management, scalability and maintenance.
Azure offers many options in that space and two of them are particulary interesting: Azure Function and Azure Logic Apps. 
What are you needs? Hanlding data coming from a form? Invalidating cached data when a file changes? Responding to an external event like new customer added to your CRM?
Everything can be done very easily and with the language of your choice, or even via an easier workflow-like approach, that doesn't even require you to write code. 
No matter which approach you decide to take, you'll need to store data somewhere. Depending on the scenario you may want to use the new multi-API CosmosDB or the well established Azure SQL.
In this session we'll see how all the mentioned technologies can help us to have architectural choices to be more efficient and effective in our job.

# Troubleshooting Always On Availability Group Failovers
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-696)
Event Date: 10-02-2018 - Session time: 11:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Sourabh Agarwal
## Title: Troubleshooting Always On Availability Group Failovers
## Abstract:
### Unexpected failovers or Unsuccessful failovers are by far the most common problem sorrunding Always On Availability Groups. Troubleshooting failover related issues can be a challenge and time consuming. In order to effectively troubleshooting these issues data needs to be collected and analyzed from different servers and replicas. Things get further complicated by the fact that there are multiple logs which needs to be looked at and that these logs are in different time zone formats. In this session we will look at how to easily identify the reasons for failover of an Availability Group and what new capabilities are being introduced to help with the analysis of AG failovers.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL
## Abstract:
### Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: A Look Inside SQL Server Distribution Statistics
## Abstract:
### Where do the estimated rowcount values come from? Look inside SQL Server’s distribution statistics to see how they are used to come up with the estimates. We’ll also discuss changes in the cardinality estimator in recent versions and look at some new metadata that gives us more statistics information.

Goals:
•	Explore the output of DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS
•	Describe when the density information is useful
•	Look at some problem scenarios for which the statistics can’t give good estimates
•	Understand why cardinality estimation involves more than just the statistics

### Does it seem strange server sizing articles automatically assume that a 2-socket system, with some number of cores, is the right solution, excepting a 4-socket for extreme circumstances? Or is this accepted because that’s what everyone assumes absent rational technical explanation based on recent generation components? There were once valid reasons for multi-socket as the baseline system, but the world has changed since then. Were your database and application architected together to achieve high memory locality on a NUMA system? If this question cannot definitely be answered in the affirmative, then more than likely a single socket system is the best server platform for database transaction processing. This is not an option currently offered by the major cloud providers.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Managing SSRS Reports using PowerShell and SSRS Web Services  (60 minutes)
## Abstract:
### When you have to do something more than once, you should script it!  That’s true for SQL Server maintenance tasks.  It’s also important for Business Intelligence projects as well.  Microsoft has provided web services to manage your reporting service and to download reports in various forms.  In this session I demonstrate how to leverage these web services from PowerShell to handle common SSRS administrative tasks:  uploading and copying a report; checking the parameter values, setting the parameter defaults, scheduling a cache refresh.  I addition, I demonstrate how to download a report top PDF using PowerShell.  You will not only come away with a set of PowerShell scripts to manage your SSRS server, you will learn how to work around some of the less intuitive features of PowerShell to use and extend these scripts.

## Speaker: Davide Mauri
## Title: Back to the Roots: When indexes are not enough
## Abstract:
### If you want optimum performance in SQL Server, you have to use indexes. But what if you already implemented indexes and your solution is still slow or it doesn’t scale like you want? Or, if you're on Azure, it is just requiring too much resources, which in turns means just more money to be spent on it? You may have to rethink the way you write your queries. How you write your queries is directly related to how you approach and solve your business problems, and more often than not thinking outside the box is the way to unlock incredible performances. But what this exactly means in a database? And how a developer can do that? In this session, you’ll see how using some lateral thinking and a set-based approach will open up a whole world of possibilities. Thanks to this demo intensive session, you'll never be the same after switching on this new mindset!

## Speaker: Paul Turley
## Title: The Nine Realms of Power BI
## Abstract:
### Planning a Power BI solution  need to understand options  choices?  There is much to consider as you discover your inner Data Avenger.  Like the old story of the 4 Blind Men  The Elephant, if you ask 4 people to describe Power BI; you will likely get 4 answers.  Power BI solutions have 9 Realms.  It's easy to get started but things can get complicated quickly...  Should you import your data  use the cloud service? or keep your data on-premises using the gateway?  Should you use DirectQuery or direct access to Analysis Services, multidimensional or tabular, in Azure or on-prem?  What's the best method to secure data  control user access?  What to license?  How will users access dashboards  reports?  Can it be embedded?  A hammer or other tools?
From simple desktop  published reports, to enterprise-scale and highly-secured solutions; we will demystify all these options  provide a roadmap to conquer the Nine Realms; from Midgard to Asgard, and from Desktop to Power BI Avenger.

## Title: Securing SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn't cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.

## Speaker: Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: Oracle vs. SQL Server-  The War of the Indices
## Abstract:
### This session is for the love of technology and learning.  Its based off research performed on objects, design and code built as similar as possible to see how Oracle and SQL Server compare in performance, usage and storage of indices.  Environments were built on-prem and in the cloud to view differences in different cloud support of database engines and based off trusted measurements in each platform so as to dig into how the use case was built, the similarities and the differences in each. 

Based off this use case, enhanced builds of more advanced index features and discussions of the advantages, reasons for the introduction and how it's effected the direction of each product, the DBAs who are responsible for them and resources. 

Takeaways are:
1.	Receive a strong education on platform differences between Oracle and SQL Server.
2.	Discover hidden insight on index storage and costs.
3.	Learn about great tips on maintaining index health

## Speaker: Michael Wall
## Title: Introduction to Log Parser: Log What?
## Abstract:
### Log Parser is one of Microsoft’s best and most under recognized tools.  Originally designed to read IIS and system logs, its simple complexity makes it a true “swiss army knife” of a tool.  With its ability to read multiple log and text formats and then spit them out in a myriad of formats, it can be used to quickly analyze large amounts of data and present them in a readable format.
This presentation will start with some basic uses of Log Parser, explain some of the core features, demonstrate some of the challenges, and finally focus on using Log Parser to decrypt SSRS logs.  These decrypted logs can then be used as a monitoring system.  
As with most things, there are multiple ways to accomplish a task.  Log Parser will be a welcome addition to your tool belt!
