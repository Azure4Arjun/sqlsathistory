## Title: SQL Server Service Broker – An Overview
## Abstract:
### Service Broker can be used to simplify messaging between applications and assist in asynchronous programming by queuing messages and/or events. This presentation will explain how to use the Service Broker services, discuss its many components and show why you’ll benefit from using it. Several case studies will illustrate an elegant way to maintain data across multiple servers and show how to reduce dependencies between related programs and/or data structures.
