# SQLSaturday #477 - Atlanta - BI Edition 2016
Event Date: 09-01-2016 - Session time: 12:45:00 - Track: Analysis Services
## Speaker: Bill Anton
## Title: Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts
## Abstract:
### "Its.Slow!" are probably the two most dreaded words for any database professional (right behind "You're fired!") 

What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session, in which we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Walk away from the session with a plan that you can implemented next week to help avoid being caught off guard by SSAS performance issues and to make troubleshooting a breeze.
