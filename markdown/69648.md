## Title: Migrating to the cloud options for SQL Server Professionals
## Abstract:
### In this session, I'll provide an overview of your options when looking to migrate your SQL Server environments to the cloud from either on-site or from another cloud provider. We'll then go through potential cloud infrastructure options such as cloud implementations, compute offerings, and security.

After that weâ€™ll dive into in to an overview of the main cloud providers and providing some examples where they might be a good fit for various SQL Server environments; as well as what you might want to take into consideration during for your migration like your HADR strategy and if your SQL Server data would be better suited in another solution that your chosen cloud provider offers.
