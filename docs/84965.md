## Title: Taking the data to Isengard
## Abstract:
### Analysis of Big Data is a fast growing field with more and more technologies popping up to enable us to analyse this data in a fast and efficient way. With the available choices of technology ever increasing, the question remains - which way do we go?

In this session we'll explore the world of middle earth with the help of Apache Spark, Azure HDInsight and PowerBI. Apache spark is a distributed data processing engine which is deployed as a cluster, with master and worker nodes. 

We'll look at setting up a spark cluster in Azure HDInsight as well as visualising the results in PowerBI.
