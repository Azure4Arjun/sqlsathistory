## Title: Parallelism in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 R2 supports up to 256 logical processors! Intel has released CPUs that support 10 cores and hyper-threading. So a quad-socket commodity server can easily support 80 logical processors. It's time for DBAs and Developers to understand how parallelism works in SQL Server! There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about how parallelism works in SQL Server and, more importantly, how to troubleshoot and solve parallelism problems. CXPACKET waits are not necessarily bad! In this session, Victor Isakov (MCT, MCM, MCA) will cover how parallelism works before presenting how to detect, troubleshoot and solve parallelism problems.
