## Title: Building an English-Based Rules Engine using the Dynamic Language Runtime and IronRuby
## Abstract:
### In this session we will explore writing an English-based rules engine that allows developers to create domain-specific rules for an application that can be easily understood by anyone. We will use a combination of C# and the DLR (dynamic language runtime) with IronRuby on the .NET platform to create a way to write, manage, and process rules for an application.
