## Title: How To Kill SQL Server in 60 Minutes
## Abstract:
### It is easy to design a system that uses SQL Server as a database backend. However, designing a system that efficiently works under heavy load is a much more complicated task. You can encounter the same set of database design and code mistakes in almost every system implemented by a team of application developers.

This Power Point-free session is targeted to developer DBAs and developers. It shows the commonly encountered obvious and not-so-obvious database design and T-SQL code mistakes and demonstrates how to bring a perfectly healthy SQL Server to its knees in just 60 minutes.
