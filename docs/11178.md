## Title: Your SQL Server Environment--Fair or foul?
## Abstract:
### Determine what's in play and what's not.

This presentation will focus on steps you can take to determine the performance of your SQL Server and where you may need to spend some time optimizing.  We will review tools and scripts that are available from Windows Server and the SQL community so you won't have to go and ask your boss to buy something.
