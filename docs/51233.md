## Title: SQL Server 2016 In-Memory OLTP for DBAs
## Abstract:
###  In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016 has been reborn. Many limitations within the previous versions have been removed, making it a viable option for a variety of workloads. As DBAs responsible for ensuring data integrity, recoverability and performance of the databases under our care, we need to know how In-Memory tables impact our jobs and our environment.  

In this session we will highlight critical issues in implementing and managing SQL Server 2016 instances and databases containing In-Memory tables. The bulk of this session will be spent walking through the process of identifying candidate In-Memory tables, migrating an on-disk table to an in-memory table and comparing performance.
