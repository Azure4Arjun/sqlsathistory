## Title: From the Trenches - Case Study of a Data Warehouse Migration  Upgrade
## Abstract:
### There's an old adage about rebuilding the airplane while you're flying it.  That sounds a bit like our recent project - planning  executing a hardware migration, and SQL/OS upgrade, of a complex Data Warehouse environment.  The components include:  multi-TB DBs, SSIS (mix of SSISDB Catalog  old-school Pkg Store), SSRS (via SharePoint integration), SSIS, SSAS (mix of MDX  Tabular), WhereScape, DNS Aliases, multiple job schedulers, various drivers/scripts/apps, and implementation of an AlwaysOn AG.    

We'll outline pitfalls to avoid, and walk you through hard-won lessons and strategies for success.  We'll discuss our automated process for continuous deployment, which greatly reduced downtime and risk.  Of course, we'll share relevant technical tips  tricks.  Possible guest-starring appearances from Chris and Dan, who were key players in the success of this project.
