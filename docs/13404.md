## Title: Virtualizing Business Critical SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Everyone knows that SQL Server can be virtualized, but most are only virtualizing development and testing environments. Top-tier production workloads can be virtualized too, with all of the performance that you enjoy today, and Dave Pettengill will provide valuable insight into how to properly prepare for and implement a successful virtualization campaign for ALL of your SQL Server environments. Practical tips, tricks, and gotchas for designing for performance will be discussed in this session.
