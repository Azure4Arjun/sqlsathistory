## Title: SQL Server 2012 Memory Management
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 brings a wide range of changes from its previous versions - one key change is the way SQL Server memory is managed. With releases prior to SQL Server 2012, there were 2 memory managers, these have been merged into 1 with the latest version, and thatâ€™s just the start of the changes for SQL Server memory. 
This session will dive into questions related to memory primarily for SQL Server 2012.
