## Title: Concurrency in PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Moore's law is not dead; it lives on as CPU manufacturers add more and more CPU cores to the same chip real estate.  In this session, we will look at the ways in which you can leverage concurrent processing in your PowerShell code to dramatically increase the efficiency of your code.  Speed up those ETL processes, execute code on multiple servers at the same time, and complete your maintenance tasks much faster using the techniques you will learn.
