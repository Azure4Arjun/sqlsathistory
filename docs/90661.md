Learn how to build your own Machine Learning Lab, without the keeping it underground.  We will cover the fundational knowledge to get started because you don't want you blowing up things in production.  Learn step-by-step in my demo to build a full lab so you too can save the cityâ€¦or at least get started with Machine Learning today.
