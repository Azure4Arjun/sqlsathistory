## Title: Tools You Probably Arenâ€™t Using. Why Not?
## Abstract:
### Policy Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS) are tools you already have if you have at least one SQL 2008 instance. These powerful but often overlooked tools are simple to use, and together they give you a central point from which to manage all your SQL instances. You can even manage your SQL 2000 and 2005 servers as well. This live demo session will show you how easy it is to use these 'hidden gems' that have been lying about in your SSMS toolbox. Real world solutions for real world problems in just minutes.
