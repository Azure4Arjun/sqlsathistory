## Title: Understanding Deadlock Printouts in the Error Log
## Abstract:
### You know to look out for deadlocks on your system. You know how to capture deadlocks to your error log. You know some techniques to apply to problem code to reduce deadlocks. Butâ€¦

Going through the error log is a pain. There are many extraneous values. The details you want are buried in there somewhere, and don't always make sense. Why isn't it easier to find exactly where the deadlock is occurring?

Come walk with me through the error log to find all the details we need. There are many helpful details in the log you didn't know existed because they were hard to read. We can find out where in the code a deadlock happened, which objects deadlocked,  and why they deadlocked. We'll go through the extra values to help put meaning to them. After doing this a few times, it gets easier to find the main details you want, and have supporting evidence when you need it.
