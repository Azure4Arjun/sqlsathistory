## Abstract:
### Head starting to explode from all the technical information you’re absorbing?  Come spend a session with us while we play games with Reporting Services…literally!  Come watch as Stacia Misner and a special guest introduce you to some  word play, all wrapped up in SQL Server Reporting Services.  She'll push the limits with what can be built in SSRS and show you how to have fun while doing it.  Board games and SQL…who could ask for more?
