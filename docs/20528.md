## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: DBA's Rules for Dummies... And Developers
## Abstract:
### In many organizations, there is a rift between DBAs and developers. The root cause is that there isn't often an established framework between what the DBAs need to manage the data and what developers need to help solve business problems. Many DBAs think that developers just write code without considering the impact to the data. And many developers think that DBA means 'Dont' Bother Asking." 

In this session for developers, veteran production DBA Mike Hillwig will help you understand the DBA's needs in order to help you bridge that gap in your organization and work better to help solve business problems.
