## Speaker: Chad  Chapman
## Title: The Rise of the Flash Powered Economy
## Abstract:
### Flash storage has revolutionized everything from smart phones and mobile computers, to web searches and social media. Unfortunately, it's been nearly impossible to deploy flash across a data center without breaking the bank. Pure Storage has cracked the code and destroyed the disk status quo. All-flash storage is now affordable enough to use broadly across any enterprise. Every company should enjoy the performance, space and efficiency advantages of flash as well as the lower maintenance, power, cooling, rack space and management costs. With Pure Storage, your business can achieve things that weren’t even imaginable with disk. No more wondering how much data you can analyze, how fast you can respond to a customer, or how quickly you can launch a new service. It’s time to unlock the productivity and creativity of your company while delivering a responsive experience to both customers and employees. All applications. All customers. All budgets. Flash for all.

## Title: PostgreSQL for the SQL Server Pro
## Abstract:
### PostgreSQL is a mature, robust and fast open-source database whose popularity grows with each new release. Let's take a look at the latest version of PostgreSQL, 9.3, and consider its strengths and weaknesses from an SQL DBA perspective. We'll dive right into the "why?" and look at some of the features Postgres has going for it, as well as some of its limitations. By the end, you should find Postgres operation and administration to be fairly similar to SQL Server, indefinitely configurable, and another good tool for any data pro's toolbox. 

I'll be demonstrating with Postgres 9.3 running on a CentOS 6.2 VM, if you would like to follow along, bring your own Linux box or Virtual Machine!

## Speaker: Rob  Vieira 
## Title: The Things You Don't Think About...
## Abstract:
### As developers of data driven applications, we spend a lot of time thinking about performance. We read articles on how to best index, or how to how to write a better query. We make trial runs and analyze them using Show Plan. We read still other articles on using views, versus functions, versus stored procs. We learn patterns to write the most maintainable code. The list goes on…. But what about the things we don’t think about?From DMV’s to lesser talked about new features, The building blocks we code on haveall sorts of things going on that we all too often either don’t know or don’t think about. In this session, we’ll take a somewhat random stroll around data development and topics that you may not know about, or may simply have not thought about in a while, and examine what they mean to your code maintainability or performance.

# Developers vs. DBA's:  Cats  Dogs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#265-Oregon-2013)
Event Date: 16-11-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 9. New Features
## Speaker: David Moutray
## Title: Developers vs. DBA's:  Cats  Dogs
## Abstract:
### Application Developers focus on delivering working code, while DBA's focus on Data Quality.  Since developers vastly outnumber us, we must - somehow - persuade them that our objectives are important, too.  This, in turn, requires that we understand the source of the conflict and learn to see the world from multiple points of view.

Event Date: 16-11-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 5. T-SQL
## Speaker: Steve Stedman
## Title: Common Table Expressions - Introduction
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it. With the Common Table Expressions session you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query. Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's. One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which not only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server. The class is designed for people who haven’t used CTE’s before, or for those who want to learn the basics of CTEs including data paging. This session pairs well with the Advanced Common Table Expressions ses

## Speaker: Tillmann Eitelberg
## Title: Advanced Data Visualization with SQL Server Report
## Abstract:
### With the standard SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) engine, you can quickly and easily deliver basic charts. In real-life reporting, however, requirements are much more complex. You need to follow the techniques for enhanced information delivery by applying methods from Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, or Prof. Rolf Hichert, including ways to visualize by corporate identity or work with spatial information. This session focuses on charts, gauges, and maps and will show you advanced techniques that will help you get the most out of SSRS. We’ll cover tricks and workarounds, tips for building your own charting engine and creating your own maps, and ways to visualize data you never thought possible with Reporting Services.

Event Date: 16-11-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 4. Design
## Speaker: Vern Rabe
## Title: The Significance of Choosing and Using Data Types
## Abstract:
### It's an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. My goals in this presentation are to show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for proper usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of imappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition, I will cover serveral data type related functions and point out caveates in their usage.

# Stop Schemers with Schema Security
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#265-Oregon-2013)
Event Date: 16-11-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 5. T-SQL
## Speaker: Arnie Rowland
## Title: Stop Schemers with Schema Security
## Abstract:
### In releases prior to SQL Server 2005, database object owners and users were the same things. SQL Server 2005  introduced the concept of database schemas and the separation between database objects and ownership by users. An object owned by a database user is no longer tied to that user. The object now belongs to a schema – a container that can hold many database objects. The schema owner may own one or many schemas. This concept creates opportunities to expose database objects within a database for consumption yet protect them from modification, direct access using poor query techniques, or removal by users other than the owner.
 
The ability to protect database objects in this way has many practical applications. One example of relevance is the protection of database objects in application development environments where developers and testers share the same set of database objects.
