## Title: 2016! Data transformation with M, SSIS, POLY, ADF, ADLA, R [DE]
## Abstract:
### It is 2016! Launch year! For the Data Platform Community at no time there were more possibilities and tools to transform data with Microsoft than today! This session will help you to find a way through the jungle. Based on a use case, we compare the tool sets in live demos and show the different approaches and when to choose what. We provide a decision matrix including the comparison by the variety of data sources, learning curve, security, scalability and many more. 
In this comparison you will find "M" (Power Query Language), SSIS (Integration Services), POLY (Polybase integration in SQL Server 2016), ADF (Azure Data Factory), ADLA (Azure Data Lake Analytics / U-SQL) and R (the Statistical Scripting Language that ships now with SQL 2016)
This gives you a good starting point for new data transformation projects or to review existing under the new approaching technologies.
