## Title: Power BI Components in Microsoft's Self-Service BI Suite
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has made extensive effort in the arena of self-service BI. By now most BI professionals have at least dabbled in power pivot and power view. But there is so much more. In this session we will look at some new components in Microsoft's arsenal of BI tools. Power Query is used to retrieve data from a much more varied set of data source types than was ever available before. Power Map can be used to quickly visualize geocentric data with layers and Power Point like slides. Lastly, the Power BI content on your Office 365 site supports sharing your workbooks with others, and has the coolest feature yet: Natural Language Q  A.
