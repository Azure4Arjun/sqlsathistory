## Speaker: William Durkin
## Title: PowerShell for the DBA: Why I love my inner pig-dog
## Abstract:
### DBAs and sysadmins never have time for the fun stuff. We are always restoring  a DB for a dev or setting up a new instance for that new BI project. What if I told you that you can make all that time consuming busy-work disappear?

In this session we will learn to embrace the power in PowerShell to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work.

Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of PowerShell expertise and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!
