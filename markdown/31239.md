# SQLSaturday #51 - Nashville 2010
Event Date: 21-08-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Session Mix
## Speaker: Brian Kelley
## Title: Fortress SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll look at how to lock down SQL Server installation starting from the operating system and diving in to SQL Server itself. We'll take on the mindset of someone in the business of breaking into systems for pay and how they would attack SQL Server. This will lead us to consider the appropriate defenses we need to have in place. Finally, we'll look at how to take this information and come up with reasonable costs for breaches as well as the defenses we want to put in place to it in order to present to the business side for additional funding/time to secure our systems properly.
