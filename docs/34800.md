## Title: The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs: A Methodology
## Abstract:
### When it comes to the servers in your environment, do you feel alone, afraid, and in the dark ?  If we want to know if our servers are healthy, where do we start?  It's very easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when you have hundreds, if not thousands, of metrics you can monitor in SQL Server.  The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs provides a clear roadmap for designing your monitoring strategy.  This session will review monitoring from a high level, helping you develop a plan from the ground up by addressing critical metrics, business needs, and your overall strategic goals.
