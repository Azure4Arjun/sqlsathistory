## Title: Scales, Measurements and Encoding Schemes
## Abstract:
### Programmers have learned how to design programs, but they haven't really thought about how to design data. First normal form requires that the columns in a table be scalar values. But how many database people actually know what a scale is or have any background in measurement theory? Likewise, how many people invent encoding schemes by simply numbering a list of values? This session should make you into a better database programmer.
