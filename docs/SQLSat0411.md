## Speaker: Niko Neugebauer
## Title: A Day with Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
Make sure you spend the whole day learning about the most important technology Microsoft has launched since the beginning of SQL Server – Columnstore Indexes. We will investigate how you can optimise your BI  DataWarehousing solutions and take the advantage of the modern Columnstore Architecture significantly boosting your query performance and analytics reporting.

Learn how to get the very best out of your existing database environments and how you can monitor, optimise, implement and solve many Columnstore Indexing problems.

Discover how to take the full advantage of the Batch Processing mode for Columnstore Indexes, which can significantly accelerate your query processing by hundreds of times, and learn about its limits.

Through the use of Dynamic Management Views, Extended Events and Traceflags we shall analyse traditional Rowstore tables and turn them into highly

## Speaker: Penelope Coventry
## Title: Automating business processes with SharePoint, Office 365 and Azu
## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
Many people are forced to use Microsoft#174; SharePoint#174; because it is already there or part of the Office 365™ ecosystem; therefore many users see it just as another task to add to their burgeoning  workload of tasks they have to complete in their busy working day. When any technology is introduced into a business it should help not hinder users. It should enable users to do more, not less. Technology should meet business needs and not be focused around a single product.

With this in mind, Penny will look at automating business processes using out-of-the-box functionality of SharePoint and with the use of Azure™ Logic Apps outside SharePoint, beyond firewalls and beyond even your own datacentre. You can create these workflows using no-code visual designers.

## Speaker: Mark Broadbent
## Title: Implementing Business Intelligence  SharePoint High Availability
## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
High Availability solutions have been around for nearly as long as SQL Server and with “Maintenance Windows” becoming an increasingly rare luxury, businesses are relying more and more on their Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence reporting platforms being available 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.

In this pre-conference session we shall explain how to design, plan, implement and maintain an end-to-end Highly Available Business Intelligence and analytic platform laying not only the conceptual foundations for your learning, but providing the practical technical hands on know-how for Business Intelligence professionals, Database (and Windows) administrators, and Technical Architects.

## Speaker: Rasmus Reinholdt
## Title: Building tomorrows ETL architecture with BIML and MDS today
## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
In this hands-on / bring your own laptop pre-con, Rasmus will show how you can take your ETL to the next level. You will go from “Zero to BIML to BIMLScript” in the duration of the day. That means, that leaving the pre-con, you will never ever again have to go over hundreds of packages to change a datatype or add a column, all you’ll need to do, is to change your meta-data and you are home free.

As our meta-data repository, we will use SQL Servers built-in Master Data Services. You will be given a thorough introduction to this component and learn how to use and administer it.
Besides getting a working knowledge of BIML AND MDS, and become able to use that in your ETL development, you will also get an overview of, and get to work with, the following advanced ETL concepts:

Early arriving facts

# SQL Anti-Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#411-Cambridge-2015)

## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: SQL Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
You can learn the basics of SQL in three days but it’ll take you 10 years to become good at it.

In this full training day we will take a look at a range of common design and coding mistakes to get an idea of the patterns and practices that absolutely do not work well for optimum performance, scale and design.

Anti-patterns are a way of naming these common design mistakes in order to make them easier to identify and remember (and correct!). Sooner or later as the demands on your database performance increase, so will the need to identify and resolve your anti-patterns.

During the day we will grow acquainted with anti-patterns on a physical level, a logical level, a SQL Query and application level, and spice it them up with some seriously foolish errors made by both myself, my colleagues and the industry at large!

Examples of SQL Anti patterns that we will address dur

# Microsoft – Building a Data Driven Strategy
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#411-Cambridge-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DBA (The Wall)
## Speaker: Microsoft and Guests
## Title: Microsoft – Building a Data Driven Strategy
## Abstract:
### For more details visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/precon7/
IDC research, commissioned by Microsoft, shows that better outcomes from data and analytics projects correlate with greater competitiveness of an organization in its industry or a better ability to fulfil its mission in the public sector. Although correlation does not equate to causation, a growing body of research shows financial and productivity benefits directly linked to better data-driven decision making enabled by business analytics solutions.

Four characteristics distinguish leaders in analytics—the use of more diverse data types and sources beyond social media to include the Internet of Things (IoT), adoption of more diverse analytical and self-service tools, methods, and metrics suited to broad range of users from data scientists to business analysts and executives, distribution of insights to a more diverse audience of business users, and the right-time application of most timely data.

# SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#411-Cambridge-2015)

## Speaker: Terry McCann
## Title: SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.
## Abstract:
### Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB.

## Speaker: André Kamman
## Title: How to be a Cloud DBA
## Abstract:
### Traditional DBA's do not just take care of making sure the backups work.  We help teams promote their databases from DEV to Production, we make copies from Production to Dev and perhaps anonimize some data on the way. In this session we will look at a bunch of our tasks that are traditionally the domain of the DBA and we will look at how to perform these tasks in a cloud or hybrid cloud situation.

# Testing T-SQL Code with tSQLt
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#411-Cambridge-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DEV (Animals)
## Speaker: Frank Geisler
## Title: Testing T-SQL Code with tSQLt
## Abstract:
### Unit-Test are a mature tool in traditional programming languages like C# and meanwhile accepted as de-facto standard. Using Stored Procedures and Functions you can put much programming logic right into the database. This logic has to be tested too. SQL Server Data Tools from Microsoft are one possible approach to generate unit tests for T-SQL Code. One of the disadvantages of SSDT is that the tests are implemented as C# or VB Solutions outside of the database. An alternative to these approach is using tSQLt, a Testing-Framework that is written entirely in T-SQL and is run completely in the database. So you are able to write unit tests in SQL Server Management Studio. In his talk SQL Server MVP Frank Geisler will show how the tSQLt Framework is set up and how it works and how you can write Unit Tests for different SQL Server Objects. Besides the free Version of tSQLt you can buy SQL Test from Redgate which is a very useful GUI for tSQLt and is demonstrated as well.

# Using SharePoint as a Service Delivery Platform
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#411-Cambridge-2015)
Event Date: 12-09-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: SharePoint (Dark Side of the Moon)
## Speaker: Ryan Yates
## Title: Using SharePoint as a Service Delivery Platform
## Abstract:
### Large organisations usually have their own dedicated Service Delivery IT platform for tracking and managing "Service Requests", but what happens in smaller organisations?
Without the right management tools and software, tracking and delivering service request resolutions can be a resource intensive task in itself and does not bode well for the quality of service to the end-user.

If your organisation has a SharePoint deployment, it doesn't have to be this way.

In this session we will utilise SharePoint's Out-Of-The-Box functionality and through a selection of customisations and technical know how, we will lay the foundations so that you may implement your own Service Delivery platform and enable your organisation to provide the type of efficient service delivery your end users expect.

## Title: SharePoint Enterprise Platforms: Build  Run Lessons Learnt
## Abstract:
### To point and click our way through a SharePoint installation is relatively easy, but will more than likely result in some form of disaster. Join SharePoint expert, Andy Talbot for a detailed discussion on building and running SharePoint platforms fit for enterprise customers.

In this session, Andy will address some of the common challenges that can take some enterprises by surprise, lessons learnt by large organisations, factors that we should have planned for, and common failure points. Attendees will benefit from this discussion regardless of if you are just starting out with your deployment, or you’re already in production. Although this is mainly targeted at the IT PRO audience, key points are made that very relevant to business users too.

## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning. Practical Guide.
## Abstract:
### Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in process of performance tuning. And in this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way we will learn practical techniques of performance tuning and solve bunch of issues. All this will be done using tools, which are installed on your system by default. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.

## Speaker: David Dye
## Title: Creating Dynamic Packages
## Abstract:
### In a perfect world an ETL solution would only have to import data from a single file that always had the same name deliver it to a single already existing table.  Unfortunately this case is the exception rather than the rule.  How can you use SSIS to: 
1.    Iterate through all files in a folder and import their content into SQL
2.    Dynamically create and name table based on a data source 
3.    Dynamically create a T-SQL statement at runtime based on run time conditions
This session focuses on how to create SSIS packages that can change to meet runtime events dynamically based on the environment.
Each attendee will leave with the knowledge and toolset necessary to:
1.      Use expressions within SSIS packages
2.      Use variables to dynamically create SQL statements
3.      Configure custom dynamic logging
4.      Use package configurations and parameters and environments to make packages more portable at execution
5. 	Replace dynamic SQL using expressions in SSIS

## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Visualizing streaming data in real time
## Abstract:
### We're all familiar with reports or dashboards that show you a static snapshot of the data
that has to be refreshed on an interval. And those are very important visualizations.
But sometimes you just have to have a real time view of your data streams and snapshots aren't enough.
What if you could monitor multiple servers with SQL Trace or Extended Events or had some other source of streaming data and 
be able to see it all happening live on a central monitoring website?
This is a scenario we'll take a detailed look at and build a system for such monitoring.
We'll do this by using Extended Events .Net provider to get the live data stream, 
SignalR to get the live stream from the server to the website and the D3 javaScript library 
for actual real time visualizations on any device.
After seeing all this in action, you'll definitely get a few ideas on where you could use this in your company.
