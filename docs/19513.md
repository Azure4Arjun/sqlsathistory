## Title:  How New Feature in SQL Server 2014 Could Benefit Business Intelligence Solutions
## Abstract:
### This session will explore several of the new SQL Server 2014 features and how they could benefit existing and new BI solutions. This includes features that are typically considered as OLTP feature such as In-memory tables (Hekaton). The session will include a demo that will consider features and the impact they will have on data warehouse load performance, query performance, storage and maintenance. I will be using Windows Azure VMs to do the demo.
