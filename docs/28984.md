## Title: Build a Scale-Out Reporting Services 2008 R2 Farm
## Abstract:
### Delivering reports is becoming more critical due to the increasing demand for business intelligence solutions. And while there are a lot of guides that walk us through building a highly available database engine, you’ll rarely see one for SQL Server Reporting Services. This session will walk you through building a scale-out SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services farm from the ground up. You’ll be surprised how easy it is to do so that you can start building your own test environment.
