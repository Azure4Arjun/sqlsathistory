## Title: Fast and Furious Dynamic SQL
## Abstract:
### We all appreciate a well-defined and well-tuned stored procedure. But sometimes the problem calls for a more dynamic solution. What are those problems and how do you generate SQL to solve them? After attending this session, you will be able to identify situations that call for dynamic SQL and address them with rapid, maintainable, and secure code.
