## Speaker: Chris Eargle
## Title: C# Ninjitsu
## Abstract:
### C# is no longer a purely object-oriented language. It is no longer just an imperative, class-based, component oriented discipline. It is also a generic, declarative, functional discipline.
 
I will introduce new principles in the context of the classic object-oriented and SOLID principles and show you how to master the C# language to be more declarative, more fluent, and more functionally cohesive.
