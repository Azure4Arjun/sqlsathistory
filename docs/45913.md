## Title: The (Consumer) Internet of Things on your arm - MS Band  PowerBI connected
## Abstract:
### The Internet of Things (IOT) gets more and more attraction - not only on the business but also on the customer side. Connected fridges, cars and smart watches - always and everywhere connected! In this session Wolfgang will show you some possibilities of the Microsoft Band 2 SDK: how-to connect and read sensor data out of this device. But what should be done with that data? 
Power BI seems to be an ideal candidate for analyzing and presenting those kind of data. The different types of real-time analytics (Stream Analytics, Power BI API, ..) will be presented and their pros and cons will be envisioned. 
The challenge: Let's prepare a real-time dashboard of Band2 data in Power BI in 60 minutes!
