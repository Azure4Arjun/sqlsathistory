## Speaker: Jan Mulkens
## Title: Automating Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is easy for end users but tends to be hard for Operations people.
Deployments tend to be all manual which is error prone and possibly not compliant.
Monitoring usually is not in place or done manually as well. This means developers have no idea who is using what, Operations has no metrics telling them ideal planned maintenance windows, licensing issues, compliance issues, etc ...
Depending on audience choice and time, we'll cover Power BI Service and/or the on-premises Report Server.
You'll walk out of this session knowing:
- Why and how to automate deployments
- Why and how to set up monitoring
