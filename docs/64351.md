## Title: Learn to Love Database Security Audits
## Abstract:
### Configuring the security on a SQL Server instance is often treated like a one-time event, but nothing could be further from the truth.  DBAs need to proactively watch each and every piece of the security infrastructure to ensure that the security we have implemented is effective and up-to-date.  But that’s a huge task in itself.  Where do we begin?

In this session, we’ll talk about why auditing is probably the single most important piece of the security infrastructure, and where to find security-related information in SQL Server’s metadata and logs.  I’ll also demonstrate how to distill the vast amount of metadata available into reports and alerts that are manageable, meaningful, and actionable.
