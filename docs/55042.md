## Speaker: Shabnam Watson
## Title: Advanced MDX scripting: Scope statements and Time Intelligence
## Abstract:
### Most Analysis Services (SSAS) cubes use an MDX script where additional calculations beyond the basic physical calculations are defined.

In this session you will learn about adding calculated measures to the cube using the cube's MDX script. Then you will learn about Scope statements, how to use them to implement conditional logic, and how they affect physical and calculated measures differently. Finally you will see some examples of time intelligence functions such as YearToDate and MonthToDate implemented using Scope statements. 

The session is for those who are familiar with SSAS and have had some exposure to MDX syntax and concepts.
