In this full-day workshop, you’ll learn about Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml), your secret weapon for saving time on SSIS package development. We’ll start by learning about the history of Biml, the tools you can use to work with Biml, what it looks like, and the problems it’s designed to solve.

Then we’ll dive into the syntax of Biml by building out a simple SSIS package step by step. You’ll learn the structure of a Biml file and how to generate a package that you can view in Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) or SQL Server Data Tools for BI (SSDT-BI).
