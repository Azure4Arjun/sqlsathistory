## Title: Using Power BI and SharePoint as a rapid development BI Strategy
## Abstract:
### See how you can use Excel and SharePoint to quickly implement a BI solution with Power BI. The Power BI tools allow you to extract, transform and load your data (Power Query), model that data (Power Pivot) and visualise the resulting analyses (Power View and Power Map) all within Excel. The results can be shared simply in the cloud with Office365 SharePoint Online. If youâ€™re ready for the next level you can migrate your model to SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise or stick with the cloud using Azure Virtual Machines.
