Event Date: 21-05-2016 - Session time: 10:45:00 - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker: Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: Microsoft Data Platform: The Open Space Session
## Abstract:
### Over the last few years, Microsoft has begun to articulate a broader vision of data beyond the flagship product SQL Server.  Azure, Hadoop, HDInsight, R; all of these products have begun coalescing into a platform which will take some time for professionals in the field to embrace.   The big question is: what do we need to know (as SQL Server professionals) in order to be prepared for the onslaught of Big Data?

This session will provide an interactive discussion around the Microsoft Data Platform, to build on our common experiences and knowledge.  As an Open Spaces topic, attendees are expected to participate fully in discussions.  I'll act as moderator, but there's no agenda and only a few slides; the content is completely up to the group.

Experience with other components of the Microsoft Data Platform is appreciated, but not required; the goal is to define "what we know we don't know" and to encourage self-motivated learning plans.
