## Title: Data replication - who with whom, for whom, why and for what?
## Abstract:
### During this session we will review all types of replications in SQL Server and find out principal differences between them and when should be applied. Besides examples of practical scenarios, we will consider what we have as alternatives and why the AlwaysOn is not one of them. As always on my sessions quite a lot of demonstrations and T-SQL code.
