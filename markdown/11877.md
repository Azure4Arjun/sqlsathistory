## Title: Getting Started with Report Services: The Setup 
## Abstract:
### In the SQL Server tool box there is a great tool called SQL Server Report Services. With five different interfaces, Report Services can be a bit challenging to setup and configure. Our focus will include setup, configuration, and deployment. When you walk away from this session, you will understand terms like BIDS, SSRS, Report Builder, and Crescent. Also, as part of this session we will cover the differences between SQL 2008 R2 and SQL 2012. If you are looking for steps to start developing your repertoire of SQL Server Report Services, this is definitely a session to attend!
