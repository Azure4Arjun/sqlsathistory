## Title: Isolation Levels â€“ Understanding Transaction Temper Tantrums
## Abstract:
### In this session we will review Isolation levels and how they affect applications that run on SQL Server.  We will explore what happens when multiple applications accessing the same data use different isolation levels, and how that effects the server as a whole.   We will also explore different ways to relieve these tantrums, and make your applications play nice together.
