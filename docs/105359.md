## Title: Exploring the World of Azure Data Explorer
## Abstract:
### If you have large volumes of log or telemetry data, then Azure Data Explorer (ADX) may be the tool you need to perform ad-hoc queries to extract insights for diagnostics, monitoring, or reporting purposes. 

This introductory session will give you a taste of the power and flexibility of ADX and the Kusto Query Language. A demonstration will show the ease of ingesting Azure Metrics into ADX and a number of ways to query this data, including Azure Data Studio and Power BI.
