## Speaker: Rob Mandeville
## Title: Virtualizing our Environment
## Abstract:
### This session will describe our journey to convert our cluttered, underutilized, power draining physical hosts to a sleek virtualized environment.  This session will also provide some VMware high level architecture, terms and concepts, and a look at vSphere (VMware admin console).  I'll discuss the differences between virtual and physical host metrics and issues surrounding them.  We'll discuss some virtualization shortcomings and then show a little about Confio's Ignite and how it can help DBAs achieve virtualization and not lose visibility of their physical layer.
