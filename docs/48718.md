## Title: Azure Data Lake Analytics. Dive into Big Data with Microsoft U-SQL lanuage.
## Abstract:
### With Azure Data Lake a new SQL-based language called U-SQL has been introduced, that combines the familiarity of SQL with new extensions for Big Data processing and easier user-extensibility. In this session I will explain the main concepts of the new language and show examples of how to use it to query unstructured, semi-structured and structured data. Discover the similarities to the SQL and database objects you know and call out some of the important differences. We will discuss tools and practices to monitor, tune and improve performance of U-SQL. What parameters to look for, how to absorb metrics, what features to tune and how to make sure you can run massive scale Big Data environments.
