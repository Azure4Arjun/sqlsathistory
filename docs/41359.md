## Title: Policy Based Management - Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### Policy Based Management is a great feature of SQL Server and easy to implement; however, for most organizations you need a way to customize it to your enterprise. Join me for this session as we take a deeper dive into PBM to see how you can customize polices, evaluate those polices across your entire enterprise environment, track those changes over time, and deliver reports to management showing your progress.
