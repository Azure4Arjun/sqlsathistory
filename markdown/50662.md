## Title: An Introduction to Execution Plans and The Query Optimizer
## Abstract:
### One of the most complex areas of SQL Server is the Query Optimizer.
It is the component responsible for turning the logical actions (that are derived from your SQL statements) into physical actions that fetch and process the required data to form your results. Not only does it have to guarantee the correct results (no mean feat when you start to think about it) but it has to do this in a performant way and the route it takes to do this (the output of the optimization process ) is described within the execution plan.

This session will be an introduction to the Optimizer and Execution Plans and take you on a journey to a wider view of the Query Engine.
Once you understand what physical actions are being taken on your logical requests (i.e. your TSQL Statements) then you will be better placed make changes to influence those actions with an end result of a better performing database system.
