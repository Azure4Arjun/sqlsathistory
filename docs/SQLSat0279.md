## Speaker: Brian Alderman
## Title: Optimizing SQL Server for SharePoint 
## Abstract:
### Knowing the vast majority of the content accessed via SharePoint is stored in SQL Server, and also knowing an incorrect configuration of SQL Server can have a detrimental impact on the performance of SharePoint it is important to understand the integration of these two products. Regardless of whether you have a dedicated DBA, or the SharePoint administrator is also the DBA, there are critical SQL Server configurations that can be made that will improve the performance of SharePoint. Often DBA’s are familiar with how to manage SQL Server, but may not be familiar with some nuances that SQL Server has when integrated with SharePoint. In this session we will demonstrate how some default SQL Server settings negatively impact SharePoint and what changes can be made to improve the performance of SharePoint. These changes include database file settings and SQL Server instance settings. We'll also examine how to properly install SQL Server and SharePoint so they work together efficiently.

## Speaker: David Stein
## Title: Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make
## Abstract:
### Many data professionals understand the basics of Data Warehouse design, including Dimension and Fact Tables, slowly changing Dimensions, and the use of meaningless surrogate keys. However, it isn’t until you’ve created a dimensional model and put it into production, that you realize just how much of an impact seemingly trivial mistakes can make. They can hobble performance, allow inaccuracy, and perhaps worst of all, inhibit adoption and usage of the new system. 

Learn how to avoid many common mistakes, from someone who’s made them and then found ways to correct them.

## Speaker: Mark Paszli
## Title: Probing into the Microsoft SSIS Model: Reconfiguring SSIS Packages Using an Automated Approach
## Abstract:
### 
While many in the BI realm are comfortable performing SSIS tasks using Microsoft Business Intelligence Studio, there is that other world of exploration that utilizes the SSIS programming interface API. Why use it? In this session we will go over some basic approaches as to how to take advantage of the SSIS  API model to perform package configuration and property changes in an automated manner. This is especially advantageous in enterprise systems that maintain numerous dtsx packages. Automating changes to SSIS packages reduces the amount of development time that otherwise would be spent if one were to go in and manually apply these changes using the graphical interface.

#### [Back to calendar](#nr-279)
Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: APP DEV
## Speaker: Andre DuBois
## Title: What secrets does your table schema hold?
## Abstract:
### Data types are the basic building blocks of table design. Using the correct data type can affect data integrity and performance.  Redesign after a table is in production is very difficult, so getting it right when building the table is crucial. 

We begin with discussion on best practices for choosing data types and why the right data type is important for performance and data integrity. We will then run scripts to spotlight inconsistent field lengths and data types as examples of secrets that will be revealed. 

This session will help you design better tables so your data is more stable and reliable. It is also a good review if you will be taking exam 70-461.

# Introduction to the Hive Query Language for BI Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-279)
Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI / Big Data
## Speaker: Orion Gebremedhin
## Title: Introduction to the Hive Query Language for BI Developers
## Abstract:
### The Hadoop ecosystem has emerged as the most viable means of working on huge amount of data which is now commonly referred to as “BigData”. The piping- and parallelism approach of breaking heavy tasks in to smaller manageable tasks and executing them in parallel on readily available commodity hardware, relies on the MapReduce programing framework. One of the challenges facing the enterprise BI team is the learning curve in moving from existing solutions built on traditional databases to Hadoop clusters which are primarly designed to be queries using MapReduce programing constructs . Initially developed by Facebook, and used and enhanced by other companies like Netflix and Amazon; the Hive Query Language (HQL), bridges the gap between MapReduce and Traditional SQL. In this presentation I will be discussing the basic commands required to interact with Hadoop File System (HDFS), as well as the fundamental query constructs of Hive. Demos will done on a Hortonworks , Apache Hadoop SandBox.

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS
## Abstract:
### Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.

## Speaker: TJay Belt
## Title: Database Release Management: Tips to help organize it
## Abstract:
### The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. 

We will discuss various terms, define processes, share ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.
