## Speaker: Anna Hadnagy
## Title: Thanks for the Feedback!
## Abstract:
### ... "Even when it is off-base, unfair, poorly delivered, and frankly, you are not in the mood."

Feedback is everywhere. Ever heard, "you need to become more well-rounded?" That's feedback. Ever seen your spouse yawn when you tell about your day? Ever been honked at at the green light because you zoned out for a second? You get the idea. 

All our lives we want to improve: we actively participate in conferences, we read blogs, we pursue hobbies, we use smart watches to get in shape. We want to be better but we also want to be accepted as who we currently are. And when we receive (often unsolicited) feedback, we feel inadequate. Not good enough. Unlovable. Not worthy. Impostors. 

This session won't teach you how to give feedback, because you've already been to several workshops teaching that (as a result of, well, feedback). It'll, instead, help you address your own "not good enough" triggers, initiate difficult conversations, and participate in them with less stress and more success.
