## Title: R with AzureML
## Abstract:
### R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. By far the most popular programming language for data science projects, R is used to solve problems in fields such as biology, physics, finance and marketing. With the recent acquisition of Revolution R and the increasing capabilities of AzureML, Microsoft's attention to deliver an enterprise-ready version of the R platform has increased exponentially. Please join me to learn the foundations of R, how to begin plotting data using ggplot2 and how R is integrated in AzureML.
