## Title: Natural Born Killers, performance issues to avoid
## Abstract:
### You’ll learn simple tricks to write better code, scripts, and tables. Plus, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Plus, you’ll learn how to take corrective action when:
•The optimizer isn’t using all available processors 
•The database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used 
•The optimizer uses the wrong plan 
•Database tables cause memory issues
