## Speaker: Christopher Price
## Title: Into the Wild,Taming Unstructured Data
## Abstract:
### There is runaway growth in the data volumes many organizations are facing today. The bad news is that much of this data is unstructured which means your traditional RDBMS just isn't capability of helping you deal with it. As a result significant emphasis has been put on technologies like Hadoop, No SQL and other distributed databases which are better suited to handling unstructured data. With the latest release SQL Server 2012 however, Microsoft has provided new features which will help tame some of this unstructured data. This session will dive into the new FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search features. We will show you how they work and highlight real world examples for integrating these exciting new features into your organization.

## Speaker: Frank Quintana
## Title: Code Paradigms in BIDS
## Abstract:
### Using BIDS we are able to answer questions in two contradictory worlds the OLTP and the OLAP in order to do that BIDS is presented with the three services SSIS, SSRS and SSAS and a variety of languages such as SQL, T-SQL, MDX, DMX, etc.
It is impossible to explain even one aspect of one of the tools that comprise BIDS (Database Tools) even less to explain the main components of the MS BI stack SSIS, SSAS, SSRS in a single presentation. So in this presentation we are trying to explain the mind set of these three services and paradigms from the perspective of the problems they are trying to solve.

# AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#226---South-Florida-2013)
Event Date: 29-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA Track (1048)
## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!
## Abstract:
### Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.

## Speaker: Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
## Abstract:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office

Add in that some features require multiple physical instances and suddenly a single installation isn't enough. Need to quickly switch between versions and editions of SQL Server? Want to learn how to set up a cluster? Or maybe you want to try out the latest features in SQL 2012...virtualization offers a convenient way to do any or all of these. In this session we'll show you how by covering the fundamentals of desktop virtualization and demonstrating how to set up a virtual playground on your own machine.

## Title: Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis
## Abstract:
### This session introduces Data Quality Services, a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from more than one source you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL 2012 answers this need with Data Quality Services (DQS). In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data. You will see how to build a domain both manually and from an existing data table. You will then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel preparing them for use in SSAS and PowerPivot. After this session, you will understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.

## Title: A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)
## Abstract:
### In this session I will cover how PowerPivot and BISM Tabular complement each other in the domains of self-service and corporate BI. Let's face it, The Finance department does not have the expertise to model a database for reporting, and IT doesn't have the expertise in advanced financial calculations that the executive team is interested in. To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.
