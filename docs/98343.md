## Speaker: Marc Bushong
## Title: A Beginner's Guide to Using GIT
## Abstract:
### Source Control is a wonderful resource to improve team collaboration, reduce the risk of problems from lone wolf development and track change efficiently. Developers are already familiar with source control, but ANY Analysts or Operations teams can benefit! If you are struggling to use source control, are frustrated with not understanding the what, why, and how, or want to start using source control then look no further!  We will cover using source control for code in stored procedures and queries for SSMS, SSIS packages, SSAS models and cubes, and SSRS reports.

With this session, you will learn the foundational knowledge to not only to apply to your workplace right away but to lay the groundwork to continue building your skills in Git. We will cover basic terms/concepts of how Git works, understanding the process flow, executing some basic commands in Git, understanding why a merge conflict happens and how to solve it, and using different GUIs if the command line isn't your thing.
