## Title: Integrating SQL Server with Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Our company built a system mixing Big Data technologies (hadoop/ElasticSearch) along with SQL Server to make a system that is both highly scalable and cost effective.  In this session Iâ€™ll walk you through the ETL process of pulling data through sqoop, transforming data in hive and presenting a denormalized table in hive.  If you are looking to understand how to get data from SQL Server into hadoop and leveraging parallel architecture this is the session for you.
