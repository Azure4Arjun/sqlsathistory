## Title: Azure Logic Apps – how to integrate different systems with zero coding?
## Abstract:
### We would love to have "one ring to rule them all", but, unfortunately, life is a very cruel place and I am yet to find a company that is able to use only one system to manage all their business flows. To manage a dozen of different systems it will be just reasonable to have a single point of integration, an integration bus if you prefer. And that's the point where Azure Logic Apps comes very handy. With hundreds, if not thousands, of different connectors to different systems I can easily receive a new order from Sales Force, check that I have required items in stock against my SQL database, post the data to SAP ERP and send an email to a client that his order is on the way. Making those things happen will require no coding whatsoever. I will not be forced to go deep diving into different system APIs and become an expert in everything. Minimum efforts and maximum value.
