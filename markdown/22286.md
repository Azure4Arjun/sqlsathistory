## Title: Standardize SQL Server Implementations (Dev to Prod)
## Abstract:
### You'll learn about a best practice framework that alleviates many of the pain points for deploying, managing, and supporting multiple SQL Server deployments from development to production.  
There are many variables to consider when supporting SQL Servers in the real world, including:  
• Cloud systems (Microsoft Azure/Amazon AWS), virtualization (VMware/HyperV), physical servers
• Different versions of SQL Servers, and different editions (Standard/Enterprise)
• Service packs and specific Hotfixes
• Configuration differences based on OS/Memory/Disk configuration
• Different products need specific configurations and features of SQL Server
• Post installation steps and default access

The best practice framework will get us past the complexities and provide us with the following capabilities and benefits:
• A Process framework configured to support the above requirements
• Flexibility to easily add new configurations
• A consistent experience
