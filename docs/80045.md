## Title: Lessons Learned from Two Years as a Devops DBA
## Abstract:
### Join me as I talk about lessons learned from two years on a Devops team. Process, source control, changes that block, rolling back changes, out of band changes, and more! I still don't have all the answers (or maybe even all the questions), but I can say this - DBA's have nothing to fear and a lot to gain when an org adopts a devops culture.
