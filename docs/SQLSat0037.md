# Adding Spatial Data Visualization to SSRS Reports
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#37-Philadelphia-2010)
Event Date: 13-03-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Adding Spatial Data Visualization to SSRS Reports
## Abstract:
### One of the great features of SQL Server 2008 is its native support for spatial data types. Spatial data represents information about the physical location and shape of geometric objects. These objects can be point locations or more complex objects such as countries, roads, or lakes. In addition, with the upcoming release of SQL Server 2008 R2, you can add maps and map layers to your report to help visualize data against a geographic background. This session looks at how you can take advantage of this support for spatial data to enhance your location based applications in new and interesting ways. You will learn how to load and query spatial data in SQL Server as well as how to present the data to uses through Reporting Services reports.

## Speaker: Dean Richards
## Title: Tuna Helper for SQL Server DBA's
## Abstract:
### Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

# Pushing Data to a Web Client Using Comet
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#37-Philadelphia-2010)
Event Date: 13-03-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Database Development-.NET
## Speaker: Terry Weiss
## Title: Pushing Data to a Web Client Using Comet
## Abstract:
### Pushing data to a web client over HTTP has always been a hassle. There are ways to do it using Flash or Silverlight, but they all require  a component and/or separate install on the client as well as obscuring the semantic value of the data. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just use Plain Old Semantic HTML (POSH) and regular JavaScript to simplify client requirements? Comet (aka long-polling) allows you to open a channel to the client and push data from the server down asynchronously. This session will walk you through the Comet architecture using .NET and JQuery to push POSH or JSON data to a web client in a performant and scalable way.

We’ll see how we can import the readily available and predefined SQL Server best practices into the Policy Management umbrella.    Finally, we’ll look at the Enterprise Policy Management Framework which can be used to provide insightful and intuitive Reporting Services reports that can provide you with the policy adherence metrics for your SQL Server Instances across the enterprise.
