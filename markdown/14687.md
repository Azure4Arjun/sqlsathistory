## Title: Dr. DMV: How to Use Dynamic Management Views
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2008 R2 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL Server 2005 through 2012), presents and explains over fifty DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment.
