## Title: Azure Data Factory. Ingest,prepare, transform and publish your data
## Abstract:
### Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data. You can create data integration solutions using the Data Factory service that can ingest data from various data stores, transform/process the data, and publish result data to the data stores.   Cool.  What is it? It is cloudy ETL? Really? Why can't I used SSIS? What  is the difference between SSIS and Azure DataFactory?  So  come to my session and I can answer all question about Azure Data Factory.
