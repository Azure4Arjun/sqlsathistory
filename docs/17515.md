## Speaker: Josh Fennessy
## Title: The Essential 8: Narrative Reporting Techniques
## Abstract:
### Providing boring static reports is no longer acceptable in today's business culture.  Analytics are expected to be highly visual, interactive, and should tell a meaningful story.  The latest version of Microsoft Excel is designed to perform those duties and more.  Narrative reporting goes far beyond the tabular format and eliminates the need for comments.

Learn how to craft narrative style reporting in this unique session.  Join Josh Fennessy and Julie Koesmarno as they guide you through several design scenarios that are often asked of a business analyst.  You'll learn Excel reporting techniques that will enable you to build highly visual and interactive reports without the need for heavy infrastructure requirements.
