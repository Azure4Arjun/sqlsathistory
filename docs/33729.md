## Title: Leveraging SQLDiag for Efficient Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Over the years, Microsoft Customer Service and Support (formerly known as Product Support Services) has developed a number of amazing tools for troubleshooting SQL Server.  Thankfully, many of these tools have been shared with the public.  Trevor will demonstrate the configuration and usage of PSSDiag (for SQL Server 2000) and SQLDiag (for SQL Server 2005 and 2008), which are for collecting a variety of useful diagnostic data.  Then he will cover analyzing the data using RML Utilities as well as a few scripts of his own.  Come and see how these tools can save you massive amounts of troubleshooting time!
