# SQLSaturday #492 - Phoenix 2016
Event Date: 16-04-2016 - Session time: 13:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Stan Geiger
## Title: "Polybase and Time Travel (Temporal Tables)"
## Abstract:
### "With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   The Temporal Table feature creates all kinds of possibilities for implementing Type 1 and 2 dimensions as well as time based reporting and logical data recovery.  In this session we will take an in depth lock at the features and scenarios for use.   We will also look at some actual demos of the technologies so you can get a feel for the technologies in action."
