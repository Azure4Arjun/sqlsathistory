## Title: SELECT Questions FROM Diversity.Inclusion WHERE AfraidToAsk = 1
## Abstract:
### In the past several years Diversity, Equity,  Inclusion (DEI) have become more important and visible in the workplace.  Studies have shown that organizations are often more successful when they are more diverse, yet the tech sector is moving slowly to improve representation and inclusion.  Many IT professionals want to improve but don't know where to start.  

This session will cover key concepts in DEI and how they apply to data practitioners.
