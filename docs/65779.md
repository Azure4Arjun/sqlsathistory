## Speaker: Ami Levin
## Title: Where did I put my (primary) keys?
## Abstract:
### In this session we will revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases: normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues from a practical perspective.
We will consider the benefits and challenges of using different types of keys - natural, surrogates, artificial (and others?) from multiple aspects: data consistency, application development, maintenance, portability and performance.
