## Title: Data Science, easy until it's not
## Abstract:
### Data Science, it really is easier than you think. 
You’re a DBA or BI Developer?
You don’t have time to become an expert in R or Python?
You’re sick of these data science sessions that assume everyone knows statistics?
Using demo’s in SQL Server 2017 ML Services, I’ll share my experience applying Machine Learning experiments as both a DBA and BI Developer.
This way you’ll finally see how easy it can actually be to build and bring a Machine Learning experiment to production.
I’ll share good practices you should apply to make your job easier and will guide you through the end to end process using Microsoft’s Team Data Science Process.
That way you'll also have all the practical knowledge you need to do this yourself.
