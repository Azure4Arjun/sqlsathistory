## Title: SQL Server 2008 Auditing
## Abstract:
### You may ask yourself, “Who did drop my table? Who altered this Stored Procedure? When did this SQL login grant access to a database? Who inserted, updated or deleted records in a table? Do you need to meet regulatory compliance needs?”
If you’d like to know the answers, this session is for you, I will cover the technical details of the new Auditing feature in SQL Server 2008 with lots of demos and how you can leverage it in your SQL server environment. I will show you how to build a Centralized Auditing Solution where you can view all audit events in your environment centrally with rich dashboards and reports to track and view all audit actions by server, database, object and users across all SQL servers.
