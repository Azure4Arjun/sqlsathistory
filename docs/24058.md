## Speaker: Scott Heffron
## Title: SSIS Metric Performance Collection (Case Study)
## Abstract:
### When architecting a data integration solution, the design decisions not only determine how successfully the solution meets functional requirements, but also how well the solution meets performance requirements. To make the right performance design decisions, you need to understand the performance architecture of the integration tool and, just as importantly, the techniques that enable you to maximize the toolâ€™s utilization of system resources.

This presentation will discuss how we created the storage area for the metrics and how capturing metrics was implemented.
