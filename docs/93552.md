## Title: We Need To Talk Security
## Abstract:
### Unless you've been stranded on a deserted island for years you've heard about all the data breaches that seem to happen every day. 

This means data security has never been more important which means SQL Server security has never been more important.

We'll take a high level look at security starting with physical security, see the two authentication modes, differences between logins and users, troubleshooting some common login issues, see how to gain access to a SQL Server and wrap up with security similarities and differences between on premise SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.
