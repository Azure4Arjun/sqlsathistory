## Title: 10 reasons you are paying too much (or too little) on your SQL licenses
## Abstract:
### If you are running SQL server in your production environment, then you know that licensing is not cheap. Not only is it expensive, but SQL licensing can be confusing, changes often, and can be hard to navigate even for the most seasoned professionals. This session will dive into 10 reasons your company may be overpaying (or underpaying) on your licenses and provide you with practical steps you can do to discover and fix those issues. As a bonus, I will also be sharing a free calculator script that I created that takes into account several things shared in this presentation (and more) that you can begin using immediately to help with your licensing decisions.  

This session is intended for anyone who is responsible for managing, allocating or advising on SQL licensing.
