## Title: Power up SSRS 2017 with Power BI and other new enhancements
## Abstract:
### Power BI and SSRS 2017 have come together as Power BI Report Server. This provides us a modern, on-premises solution for enterprise reporting and mobile business intelligence. 

Will review and demonstrate the new Mobile Reports, KPIs and Paginated reports. The new Mobile Report publisher produces stunning dashboards that can be viewed on any device (iOS, Android and Windows). Other enhancements include, show/hide download menu, report comments, custom placement of parameters, custom branding your SSRS portal's with your choice of colors and logo.

Will top off by demonstrating recent technical releases that support hosting Power BI reports (.PBIX) in Power BI Report Server, which include custom visuals.
