## Title: Zero to "MERGE" in 60 Minutes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 saw the introduction of the new MERGE DML statement. In this session, we'll take a look at the basic syntax and capabilities of the command. Once we have reviewed some simple examples, we'll dive into some of the more advanced uses (abuses?) of the command, reinforcing our understanding by looking at more complex examples.
