## Title: Indexing Internals for Developers
## Abstract:
### What are the secrets to making your queries run faster?  Why does SQL Server use an index for some queries and not for others?  What makes a good index?  How many indexes should I have?  Have you ever asked these questions? When you want to understand an application you look at its core architecture. Underneath the covers SQL Server is just a C++ application.  Together we will discuss how the application architecture of SQL Server works, and how to apply this logic to building the best indexes for your queries.
