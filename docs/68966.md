## Title: Understanding Your SQL Server Ecosystem
## Abstract:
### As it becomes more likely that our SQL Servers are virtualized, viewing it as part of a complex system becomes more important.  Learn the key components to the SQL Ecosystem, and how they interact with other aspects of your IT environment.  I'll show you a few gotchas and a few neat things you can possibly take advantage of.  We'll also talk about some key communication points across teams, and ways to facilitate the flow of information.
