## Title: Visual Studio Database Tools
## Abstract:
### Visual Studio is now host to several improvements for developing databases, database objects, and database code. These features are collectively known as SSDT -- SQL Server Data Tools. During this presentation, we'll discuss what SSDT has to offer, how database developers and administrators might take advantage of these features, and common patterns for working with database designs between SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SSDT.
