## Title: SQL Server Extensibility Framework
## Abstract:
### You may ask yourself what SQL Server Extensibility Framework (SSEF) is. Well, you may know it under another name: SQL Server Machine Learning Services (ML services). The thing is that since Python was added to the languages of SQL Server ML Services, you no longer are limited to purely data science "stuff" in SQL Server ML Services, you can do a lot of other things as well. So in this session, we will "use and abuse" SSEF and through lots of code and demos see what awesome things we can do!
