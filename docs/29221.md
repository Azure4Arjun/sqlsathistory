## Speaker: Brent Ozar
## Title: Performance Tuning for Race Car Drivers
## Abstract:
### Times are tough even for the best drivers: Helio Castroneves is dancing for money and Danica Patrick is doing ads for what appears to be an adult services company.  Maybe itâ€™s time to switch careers, and Brent has just the thing.  Use your hard-earned knowledge of high speeds, million-dollar hardware and surviving disastrous crashes to become a SQL Server performance tuner!

In this session, Brent will show you why Colin Chapman and Enzo Ferrari would have used index tuning, database mirroring, and other tools that can give you an edge.
