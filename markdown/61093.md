## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Support Engineers troubleshoot performance issues all day, every day.  They use a set of tools that not only gather all the data necessary to troubleshoot any performance issue, but the tools also analyze the data and generate visually attractive reports. These tools have been available to the public for free for years.  This presentation explains the tools, how to run them and how to interpret the results, including how to determine disk latency root cause, top reasons for high cpu, and what to do when you have excessive waits.
