## Title: Unit testing Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### Attend this session to get an overview of two different approaches to automate your testing of Analysis Services cube. The first approach captures snapshot of the cube metadata/structure and a representative sample of values from all measures. With a set of reports it is possible to compare the snapshot and find the differences - ie before and after deployment. The second approach uses the test framework nBI to test result sets, performance, syntax, structure and dimension members.
