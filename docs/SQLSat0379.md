# Once Upon a DateTime
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#379-South-Florida-2015)
Event Date: 13-06-2015 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: BI track
## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Once Upon a DateTime
## Abstract:
### Creating calculated measures and columns in DAX is an essential part of any Tabular or PowerPivot model. Since most data represents events that occur over time, a time dimension is critical in those models to reveal data trends. However, perhaps even more important than just using time as a dimension is using DAX time functions to calculate aggregate measures grouped on discrete time periods such as months, quarters, and years, period to date aggregates, and the analysis of parallel periods to compare the past to the present. For most financial analysis of data, the ability to look at data grouped by different time periods is essential in making good business decisions. Come to our monthly meeting to learn how to use the DAX date functions to successfully analyze data over time.

### Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

# Easier schema migrations, data migrations  more w/ Redgate tools

## Speaker: Eric Soto
## Title: Easier schema migrations, data migrations  more w/ Redgate tools
## Abstract:
### Managing data models and data for existing applications can be cumbersome and fraught with pitfalls. Many developers and DBAs rely on "change" scripts they produce manually whenever they need to deploy changes or updates. Though this might work well for small and infrequent changes, it's much harder to pull off with large teams, complex applications or applications that change all the time. In the world of software, we rely on source control and code-differencing tools. However, these tools are much less common when it comes to database schemas and data in databases. Enter RedGate tools: SQL Compare, SQL Data Compare and others. These tools allow the DBA to quickly "compare" databases (even data) and quickly generate "change scripts" that can be used to roll out changes and/or audit databases. In this session, we explore these tools and how I've integrated them in my workflow when supporting business applications. [Note I do not work for Redgate and this is not a vendor session.]

## Abstract:
### What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!

### The Entity Framework enables developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects and properties, without having to concern themselves with the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With such great power comes great frustration; Namely our Database Administrators' as they trace through and attempt to optimize the Entity Framework auto-generated SQL statements hitting our databases.

This talk aims to empower the DBA with an understanding of the architecture behind the Entity Framework and the most common pitfalls programmers fall for when attempting to rapidly write data access layer code using the Entity Framework and what can be done to overcome them.
