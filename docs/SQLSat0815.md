## Speaker: Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI
## Abstract:
### No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.

# Learn History from Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#815-Nashville-2019)
Event Date: 12-01-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Database Administration 
## Speaker: Ameena Lalani
## Title: Learn History from Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.

# Modern SQL Server Security Features for Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#815-Nashville-2019)
Event Date: 12-01-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Database  Application Development 
## Speaker: Leonard Lobel
## Title: Modern SQL Server Security Features for Developers
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, the relational engine has been greatly enhanced for security with three new features that you’ll learn about in this demo-packed session. With dynamic data masking (DDM), you can fully or partially conceal sensitive columns from query results. Masking does not modify data on in the table, it simply hides data from users that don’t have permission to see it. Row-level security (RLS) also hides data from unauthorized users, but at the row level. With RLS, you can create your own security policy to control which users can read or write specific rows in the table. Finally, Always Encrypted (AE) uses client-side encryption to ensure that data is encrypted in flight, not just at rest. Furthermore, the encryption keys are accessible only to the client. This guarantees that data cannot be decrypted on the server, easing the migration path to the cloud for users with highly sensitive data.

# Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#815-Nashville-2019)
Event Date: 12-01-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Database  Application Development 
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
## Abstract:
### We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for worloads that are _mostly_ insert? Are they always recommended for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations? Does it help to create non-clustered indexes on top of heaps? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Cleaning Is Half The Battle: Launching A Data Science Project
## Abstract:
### There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will use the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.

## Title: SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.

# Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#815-Nashville-2019)
Event Date: 12-01-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: Database  Application Development 
## Speaker: David Maxwell
## Title: Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis
## Abstract:
### When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views for examining wait statistics from the instance level to the database level, all the way down to the individual query level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods including T-SQL queries and SQL 2017’s new XEvent Profiler, and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

Event Date: 12-01-2019 - Session time: 14:50:00 - Track: BI Architecture  Management
## Speaker: Spencer Swindell
## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
## Abstract:
### Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

We’ll look at both traditional and non-traditional weak points, how an attacker discovers them, exploits them, and then covers up his or her tracks. We’ll also discuss what we can do to compensate for a weakness we can’t fix, which revolves mostly around detection and response and how an attacker will respond to such countermeasures.

# Characteristics of a Great Relational Database

## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database
## Abstract:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad relational database design (whether they know what the term "normalized" means or not.) Normalization is a key to great relational designs, but there is so much more to be considered. A normalized database that suffers from poor naming, too many or too few indexes, terrible interfaces, and so on can derail your design's value to the user.  In this session I will present primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.
