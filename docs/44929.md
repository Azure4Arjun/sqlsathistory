### SQL Server 2014 has come with many performance boosting features. In-Memory OLTP being one of the favourites, there are two more less talked about heroes - Delayed Durability and Buffer Pool Extensions. With the increase of usage of SSDs in production environment it has become essential to use them to the full potential. In this session Manohar will explore Delayed Durability and how it is achieved. He will also cover a case study with delayed durability and SSDs. SSDs can be fully utilized by enabling Buffer Pool Extensions. He will cover the usage and caveats of both these features which boosts the transaction throughput.
