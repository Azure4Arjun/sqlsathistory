## Title: Bad SQL
## Abstract:
### How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.
