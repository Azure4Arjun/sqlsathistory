## Title: Autonomous Transaction Logging in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Autonomous/nested transactions are available in other database products, but are not natively supported in SQL Server. Fortunately there are several methods available to provide this functionality. 

We'll cover the standard table variable techniques to preserve data outside of transaction scope, and how the new in-memory table type can improve their performance.  Other techniques like user-defined events, CLR procedures, linked servers will also be demonstrated, and how they can enhance functionality.

We'll review minimal techniques like RAISERROR and the new SESSION_CONTEXT() feature in SQL Server 2016, to provide different levels of logging and transaction management.
