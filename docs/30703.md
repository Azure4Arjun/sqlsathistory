## Title: Women in Tech:Why are we still talking about this?
## Abstract:
### If you find yourself rolling your eyes at another Women in Technology talk, then this panel session is DEFINITELY for you. WIT talks aren't exclusively for women, aren't time set aside for complaining about injustices. WIT talks ARE about finding new ways to make the exciting and lucrative IT field more accessible for our friends, and our children.
