## Title: SSIS 2012 Parameters, deployments, and environments
## Abstract:
### SSIS 2012 brings some paradigm shifting concepts to the table.  Configurations are being deprecated in favor of Parameters, the Project deployment model vs. the package deployment model, and the addition of environments.  This sessions will go hands on to review upgrading some packages, working in parameters and dropping your configurations, work through some of the advantages of the Project deployment model, and round it out with a discussion on Environments to help control the behavior of your packages.
