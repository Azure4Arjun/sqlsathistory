## Title: Real-Time Streaming in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI offers compelling streaming features that allow you to view your data in real time in a web browser and on mobile devices. In this session we'll examine how to setup streaming datasets and dashboards for real-time viewing. For a demonstration we'll look at how to stream performance counter data from Windows into Power BI using C#, giving us a real-time view of system information that is accessible from anywhere.
