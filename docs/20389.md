## Title: Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL by Changing Your Habits
## Abstract:
### Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. You’ll also learn how to use set theory to improve performance. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.
