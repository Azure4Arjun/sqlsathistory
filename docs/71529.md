## Title: SQL Audit - Evidence Never Lies
## Abstract:
### We've all heard about massive data breaches from big name companies. As a DBA, you should consider your company's data to be the most valuable assets. So when a data breach happens at your company, will you be able to provide management with the information? If not, then discover how SQL Server Audit can help provide you with an accurate forensic analysis of who did what to your data. In this session, we'll cover what SQL Audit can capture, how to set it up for both on-premise SQL Servers and Azure SQL Database, and finally produce reports from it.
