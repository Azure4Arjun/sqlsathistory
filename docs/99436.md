## Speaker: Bob Phillips
## Title: Do I Need To M?
## Abstract:
### Power Query is an powerful tool enabling the data analyst in creating usable data. It is one product that can truly claim to be user friendly, as so much of the functionality is available within the UI.

But, and there is always a but, sometimes you need to do things that are just not available through the UI. This is where you need to get down and get dirty, and manage the M code directly (M being the language that drives Power Query).

This session is all about the value of developing skills in M. Starting with a brief intro to M and some references to resources to help develop those skills further, we will then demonstrate a number of things you can do by directly coding in M, things that are not as simple or just can't be done through the UI.

The session will be using Power Query in Excel as Excel is still the most used BI delivery tool, but all of the techniques and code also apply to Power BI.
