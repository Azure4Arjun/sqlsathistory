## Title: Cube Monitoring  Load Balancing in MS-Adcenter 
## Abstract:
### The session is mainly a review of Cube Health Monitoring and Load Balancing in adCenter Enterprise Cube Environment.  It is a detailed discussion and review of our process on achieving the following goals:
1.	Create a load balancer across the OLAP cubes
2.	Achieve better monitoring and alerting of our enterprise OLAP systems
3.	Increase our Up-time and monitor our SLA
4.	Increase our ROI of the HW
Currently AdCenter has two major services that are integrated / connected to each other: first one does the monitoring and alerting of the OLAP cubes and the second one does load balancing across the OLAP servers. The monitoring service notifies the load balancer when a server is not available so the cube balancer does not route traffic to it
