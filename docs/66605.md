## Title: Intro to Azure from a DBA's Perspective: How to Cover Your a.a.s.
## Abstract:
### Head in the "cloud"? Looking for a "cloud" with a silver lining? There are many clich√©s that can be used when talking about "cloud" technology but really, how does Microsoft's "cloud" offering, called Azure, actually work? Let's take a look at some basics and maybe even take a dive into the deep end. We'll look at terminology ("subscriptions", "Infrastructure as a service", "resource manager" etc.), how to create various resources (virtual machines, databases, virtual networks etc.) and maybe even log into a "cloud" database. I'll present a solid foundation that will enable you to get comfortable with the technology and allow you to expand your "cloud" skills.
