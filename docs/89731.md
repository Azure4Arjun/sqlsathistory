## Title: Power BI Governance 101
## Abstract:
### Deploying an enterprise business intelligence solution is no small task but one of the most important factors to consider in order to have a successful roll-out of a self-service analytics tool like Power BI is governance. In this session, we'll discuss why governance is so important for a successful Power BI deployment, what are the components of Power BI that require governance, and how to govern your Power BI environment. By the end of this session, the audience should have a clearer understanding of governance in the context of Power BI.
