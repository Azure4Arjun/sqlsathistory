## Title: MS Access with SQL Server Strategies and Tips
## Abstract:
### Access can be a rapid development UI for small SQL Server databases, saving you time and money over .Net, IF you follow the right strategies and avoid the pitfalls. We will discuss how to fine tune the relationship between the two, strategies on importing data, how to minimize connections to SQL Server and touch on Access Data Projects. We will also discuss where Access as the presentation layer makes sense and DBA strategies in working with Access developers. At the end you will walk away with a better sense of managing the Access/SQL Server relationship.
