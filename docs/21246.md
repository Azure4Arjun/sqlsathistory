## Title: Long running task processing with Azure
## Abstract:
### Azure offers amazing capacities for computation for a low cost, but it can be a challenge to create a seamless user experience when there are so many moving parts. This talk will go over a methodology of getting potentially gigabytes of data to azure and back to the user seamlessly using ASP.NET MVC, SignalR, and Azure CORS. I also plan to go over some important limitations of various azure services and tools that I've discovered (the hard way) working on my projects with Azure.
