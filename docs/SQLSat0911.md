## Speaker: Tim Lentine
## Title: Building Scalable Cloud Databases
## Abstract:
### Usually when developers and DBAs talk about scaling databases we mean 'scaling up' our database server to handle the increased demands of our users.
But what if 'scaling up' isn't the only or best answer? 
What if we're building a multi-tenant SaaS application, and want to have a single front-end for each of our clients, but have multiple back-end databases to segregate customer data?
In this talk, we'll look at ways we can scale our SQL Server Databases 'out' instead of 'up'.
We will touch on a few database design considerations before diving into the Elastic Database Client libraries to see how we can add intelligent data-dependent-routing to our applications, ensuring that each request is routed to the correct database. 
Finally, we will explore how Azure Elastic Database Pools can be used to optimize our database workloads in Azure.

## Speaker: Ashwini Jain
## Title: How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.

## Title: A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Index Column Selection
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder how to select what columns need to be in an index definition and what columns should be in the INCLUDE clause.  This session will take a deep dive in looking at two SELECT queries on the AdventureWorks2017 database and what indexes give the best, adequate, and poor performance and their relation to disk space utilization.  Sometime what you have heard (word of mouth) is not always the overall best solution.  In addition ever wonder if covering indexes can be used for UPDATE statements -- answer is yes and a demo will show that.  And a final tidbit will be a demo how an unused index can affect a SELECT statement's performance poorly.  This session is about 60% demos and yields some surprising results.

# CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming

Event Date: 09-10-2021 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: ETL
## Speaker: Diane Schuster
## Title: CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.

# Azure SQL DW. Redefining MPP, how it stacks against Snowflake and RedShift

## Speaker: Oscar Zamora
## Title: Azure SQL DW. Redefining MPP, how it stacks against Snowflake and RedShift
## Abstract:
### Data Warehousing has been traditionally deployed via on-prem MPP solutions, and due to cloud modernization, and datacenter reduction footprint initiatives, organizations are looking out to establish a relationship with a cloud solution that can help them get off the traditional storage and compute licensing scheme, to easily scale their workloads without spending millions in newly acquired hardware, and to reduce their database administration operational tasks. 
Snowflake, RedShift and Teradata provide a path to migrate workloads into the cloud and allows a very reduced utilization expense for both compute and storage. That is at least, what the marketing says as it has a tacit disclaimer around it. 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse offers scalability, pay-as-you-go compute solutions, with data contained within the database boundaries. 
The presentation shows a side by side comparison, with pros and cons of each platform and debunks some of the myths that have surfaced.

## Speaker: oscar garcia
## Title: Build a Modern Data Warehouse from disparate sources with Apache Spark and Power BI
## Abstract:
### A data warehouse (DW) is a core component of business intelligence and a central data repository for different sources. This poses many challenges as the schema definition for those sources may be completely different from one another. In this presentation, we discuss how to create a data warehouse model that can support data from multiple systems. Oscar Garcia shows how to build a dimensional model which can enable us to import the data with different shapes into a data warehouse. We then create processes to transform and load the data using Apache Spark. We finally use Power BI to visualize the data from our data warehouse and Spark.


Learning Objectives:

Challenges when using disparate data sources (different models)

Define a common model to support the different model shapes (Star Schema)

Apache Spark Overview

Strategy for loading the different data-sets into the common model

Data analysis and visualization with Power BI

## Speaker: Santosh Hari
## Title: SQL Server is not an excuse to avoid DevOps
## Abstract:
### Working as a DevOps consultant in the field I hear this excuse all the time: "We can't do DevOps, we use a SQL database"
Handcrafted database deployments take days and are extremely fragile. This often leads DBAs to the misconception that introducing DevOps - which naturally leads to an increased cadence in deployments - will result in DBAs doing deployments all the time and with more breakages. We will dispel this misconception by showing how DevOps automation and a little discipline allow better testing, shorter release cycles, and reduced business risk. We will also discuss some techniques and best practices for introducing DevOps for SQL Server deployments.

## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.
