## Speaker: Tomasz Libera
## Title: Service Broker in action
## Abstract:
### Service Broker is one of the interesting but not so widely known SQL Server feature. It allows processing massive workloads without need to wait until processing is done because it is asynchronous in contradiction to stored procedure. Processing of workloads and other interesting scenarios of Service Broker feature usage will be covered during the session. You will see many interesting demo scripts that allow you to start using asynchronous processing straight away after the session. There will be also information about messages, contracts, queues, services, conversations, activation and all other stuff you need to know.
