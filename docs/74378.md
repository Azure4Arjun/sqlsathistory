## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Operationalizing Data Science
## Abstract:
### The challenge of developing a predictive model is the secret sauce that data science practitioners strive to achieve. While sophisticated predictive models can be game changers that give you a competitive edge, they must be nurtured and closely watched to ensure they perform as expected. This session shows attendees how to build a framework and develop a data model that handles prediction logging, prediction performance management, and analysis. A case study will show predictions can degrade and ultimately fail, further emphasizing the importance of tracking their performance.
