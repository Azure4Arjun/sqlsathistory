## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
## Abstract:
### So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.
