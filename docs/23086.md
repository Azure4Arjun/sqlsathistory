## Speaker: Robert Miller
## Title: You got an OVER clause in my SQL.
## Abstract:
### The OVER clause tends to be under appreciated and, sometimes, ignored.  SQL Server 2012 includes new features in the OVER clause.  The new features will be discussed along with what that pesky "Window" thing is and how it fits with the OVER clause.
