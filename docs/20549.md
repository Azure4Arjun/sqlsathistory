## Title: New Server in an Hour? No Problem!
## Abstract:
### "We need a new server before you leave on vacation!" Never mind that it's Friday at 2:00 PM and you need to be in the airport in a couple of hours. This isn't the time to panic. Mike Hillwig deploys new servers every week and has a streamlined process that allows him to deploy a new server in an hour from delivery of the Windows server. We're not talking just installing SQL Server. This is having the new server production-ready in an hour, including scripts to backup, monitor, and maintain databases. With a little bit of advanced planning, following a few simple rules, and some scripting, you can be ready for just such an emergency. And you'll still catch you flight!
