## Title: SQLServer2012 as semantic search engine
## Abstract:
### With the increase in the number of documents created, received and stored by computer, consequently increases the difficulty and time to retrieve these documents based on their content and meaning. With SQL Server 2012 and its new features of Filestream and FullText engine, it is possible to go beyond the "classical" management of key words and phrases linked to each document. Thanks to semantic search you can search for documents according to their meaning, find related documents and retrieve similar documents easily and effectively.
