## Speaker: Pat Latorra
## Title: Accelerate SQL Server 10x
## Abstract:
### This interactive session presents reference architectures and actual IT case studies for integrating Solid State Disk (SSD) into existing storage infrastructures to boost performance and enable virtualization especially in big data environments where data volumes are growing rapidly, and applications and users are demanding high-speed concurrent access.  Attendees will see how large database environments can be more strategic in their deployment of SSD and reap 10-fold performance acceleration without the need to reconfigure or move applications or data, without forklift hardware upgrades, and without changing data protection policies. This session will allow one-on-one Q  A with a technical architect.
