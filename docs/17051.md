## Title: SQL Server Amnesia: Diagnosing Memory Problems
## Abstract:
### Amnesia is caused by injuries, traumatic events, or physical deficiencies.  Memory problems in SQL Server can also be classified using these same terms.  This session will take a deep dive into memory internals in SQL Server by covering the SQLOS and the differences in memory allocations in SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2012.  This session will focus on common patterns and problems that affect SQL Server memory usage and how to solve them based on real-world scenarios. From incorrectly sized hardware to code and schema design challenges that tax SQL Servers memory usage, this session will give you the tools necessary to tackle even the most challenging memory problems.
