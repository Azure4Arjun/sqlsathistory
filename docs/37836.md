## Title: Real World Error Handling in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Every SQL developers should by now be aware of the new error handling introduced in SQL Server 2005, i.e. BEGIN TRY ... END TRY BEGIN CATCH ... END CATCH, and all of us are most likely extremely happy that we finally have "proper" error handling. 
However, in the "real world" it may not be so straight forward as just using this new error handling. As we at Derivco have seen there are quite a few "gotchas" when it comes to  how to handle errors. In this session we will take a look and see what issues we have to be aware of, in order not to be bitten by our error handling.
