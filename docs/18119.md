## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: Partitioning as a design pattern
## Abstract:
### How do you design a data warehouse for the handling of management information in seven subject areas for all 98 municipalities in Denmark? Especially when there exists up to five different IT systems per field, and that the municipalities can use the systems differently. Add to this a requirement to change the business rules for each municipality, and the ability to report on one municipality, while data for another municipality is updated.

The talk is relevant for DBA's, (BI) developers and BI architects.
