## Title: SQLCmd Mode - The T-SQL Easy Button
## Abstract:
### Ever found yourself writing a T-SQL script and wishing you could do a relatively simple task that T-SQL just doesn't support? Like running a SQL script and passing in parameters at run-time? Or using a variable across multiple connections without using a linked server? Or run the script across multiple instances in a single window?

SQLCmd mode in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the answer to these problems and many more. Unfortunately, most people don't even know about these capabilities. It's the T-SQL easy button that almost nobody uses!

This demo-heavy session will teach you how to leverage new capabilities that have been at your finger-tips the whole time ... well at least since 2008.
