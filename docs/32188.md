## Title: A step back in time - Temporal Database Designs
## Abstract:
### Jane Smith's name has a typo and someone fixes it. Jane gets married and she takes a new last name. It too has a typo, but gets corrected. A temporal database can show who changed what when. But wait there's more, querying the table "as-of" the day before Jane's wedding should return 'Smith' because that was the valid data on that effective date. Temporal databases have a reputation as being difficult, but I'll demo a few design patterns and timely functions that can tame the beast of time. Specifically you'll see: AutoAudit, temporal columns, temporal foreign keys and joins, and temporal hierarchies.
