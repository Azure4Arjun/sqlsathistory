## Title: Windows Server 2016 Infrastructure for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### A paradigm shift has occurred in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. For the last 4 years it has been possible to design a platform for SQL Server 2012/2014/2016 where you no longer need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and where I/O is no longer a problem.

Windows Server 2016 will not only increase functionality from previous versions but brings entirely new features such as Storage Spaces Direct and Storage Replica to the table.

The session will briefly cover the Windows Server 2012 R2 and SQL Server 2012/2014/2016 setups, but we can also add this functionality to older versions of SQL Server.

But the main part will show how new Windows Server 2016 features for the first time can overcome SQL Server limitations, all the way up to and including SQL Server 2014.

This will all be based on the last version of Windows 2016 before release and show results from the first customer in the world to run this in full production on the beta builds.
