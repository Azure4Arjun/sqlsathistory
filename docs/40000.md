## Title: SQL Server 2014, more than just in-memory
## Abstract:
### It feels like the only feature of SQL 2014 people talk about is in-memory but SQL Server 2014 has some other really cool features like Buffer Pool Extensions, Resource Governor Improvements, Incremental Statistics, Online Operations Enhancements and more.  We'll take a look at some of the lesser advertised improvements to SQL Server.
