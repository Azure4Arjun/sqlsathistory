## Title: Loading a Data Warehouse with SSIS
## Abstract:
### You've just been assigned a data warehouse project. Maybe you've figured out what tables you want to work with, but outside of that you don't really know how to get started. In this session we'll cover some of the basics of data warehousing, and then we'll show how to use SSIS as an ETL tool to load a Kimball data warehouse.
