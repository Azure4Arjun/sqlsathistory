## Title: Query Tuning without Production Data
## Abstract:
### The DBA is constantly ringing your phone complaining about why you did not include an index to support your new stored procedure. They have full access to production and do not understand how hard it is to tune a query with an underpowered development machine and a database which is less than 1/10th the size of the production equivalent. This session will cover query tuning techniques which will stop those phone calls and can be exercised on the worse of development environments. I will focus on query execution plan anti-patterns and faking out the optimizer.
