## Title: PolyBase: I now pronounce you SQL and Hadoop
## Abstract:
### If you thought the Royal wedding of 2011 was a big deal, then you're about to be blown away! This is a match made in Data Heaven. You're all invited, no need to RSVP, there is plenty of food for thought in this session. There will be some background talk and a demo for querying and creating data on HDFS (using Azure Blobs). As a special gift to the happy couple, we will also have a special demo with JSON documents. This will be the greatest coming together of 2016! See you there!
