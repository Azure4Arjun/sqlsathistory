## Speaker: Julie Koesmarno
## Title: Analytic Cartography: Master geospatial reporting
## Abstract:
### One of the hottest trends in analytics right now is geospatial reporting. Long gone are the days of viewing region based data in a grid. Now it is possible to provide users with additional insight on the regional performance of business.

In this session, Julie will show you three options for creating and delivering these analytics. First SQL Server Reporting Services 2012 will be presented to show how we can create custom shape objects to conform with business defined regions. Secondly, using the power of Excel 2013, Bing Maps and GeoFlow, learn how to build captivating visualizations directly in Excel. Finally, we'll show how easy it is to build interactive maps using Power View.
