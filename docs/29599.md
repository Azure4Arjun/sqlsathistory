## Title: Don't Be Trigger Happy: Safe Use of Triggers
## Abstract:
### Triggers can be a handy tool in the toolbox, but many times they are used improperly because of a lack of understanding of how they work.  This session will give an overview of the different types of triggers available in SQL Server and then will focus on specifically on the safe use of DML triggers.  We will talk about when to use triggers and touch on other options.  I will demonstrate of both safe and unsafe triggers.
