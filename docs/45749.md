## Title: PolyBase in SQL Server 2016: Query Hadoop with ease
## Abstract:
### With the increased volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data , organizations are adopting heterogeneous data stores like Hadoop and cloud, requiring new skill sets to operate and making it harder for DBAs to build applications over them. This session will describe PolyBase, a new feature in SQL Server 2016, that will open the doors to data stored outside of SQL Server. PolyBase allows customers to use T-SQL to access and query data residing in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. It can intelligently push-down computation to Hadoop by generating Map jobs on-the-fly as well as scale-out query processing in SQL Server to enable highly performant queries on massive Hadoop data sets. 

This session will cover the PolyBase fundamentals of what the feature is, how customers are using it and how it works under-the-covers. In addition, the session will include a Live Demonstration of how PolyBase can be used to bring relational and semi-structured data together using SQL skill sets.
