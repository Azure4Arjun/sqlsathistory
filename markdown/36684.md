## Title: Big Data querying with HDInsight and Hadoop with Excel
## Abstract:
### More and more companies are tackling big data to gain business insight. In this presentation, we will learn how to process Big Data in Azure using HDInsight, Microsoft's implementation of Hadoop. It is oriented towards non-traditional data querying. We will go through how to set up an HDInsight cluster, load data, query it, and then use Power Query to pull the data into Excel for visualization. If you've been wondering what all the Big Data hype is about or how you can solve it with the Microsoft stack, this is the presentation for you.
