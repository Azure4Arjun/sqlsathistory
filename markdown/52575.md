## Title: Deep Dive on the IoT Hub
## Abstract:
### When you design IoT solutions in the Azure cloud there are some things you are going to need to do.  Being able to send events to a resilient queue that can handle millions of transactions per second is fine but what do you do about security?  Surely you only want registered devices to be able to send to that queue?  What about storing details about those devices too?  Maybe we want to be able to tell where a device is located, its model and serial number.

IoT solutions very often are not a one way street.  Having devices send their data to the cloud is great but often you need the cloud to talk back to your device.  
OK so our data is in the cloud but now what?  What do we do with it?  What can we do with it?

This session is going to show you how to solve all of these things.  It is going to be heavy on demos and will build the solution in stages so nobody gets lost.  We'll use a mixture of technologies all of which are available in Azure.

Come to the session to learn more.
