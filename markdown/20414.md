## Title: Database Development Comes out of the Dark Ages
## Abstract:
### Database development has traditionally been done using SQL Server Management Studio query window as the primary tool, when far more powerful tools are available in your toolset. This is the equivalent of writing a document using Notepad, when MS Word is available on your desktop. This session will take you through some of the basics of using SSDT, show you how to use VS2012 database projects effectively, how to utilize TFS build, test and deploy your code. I've had my share of bumps on the road to deploying these toolsets. At the end of this session you will have a good introduction into how to use the tools and how to avoid some common issues with legacy code you are already have in your environments.
