## Title: Merge Replication for High Availability
## Abstract:
### Load balancing web servers between database servers enables high availability when using merge replication. When one data center has a power failure, the HVAC is down or other disaster, the web hosting and databases at the other data center can take over new connections along with the existing connections and continue with the entire load. Upgrades and equipment maintenance are more convenient when another data center can easily take over. There are limitations and specific procedures for setup and maintenance. Discover the benefits and caveats of merge replication.
