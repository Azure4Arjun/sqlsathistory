## Title: Do More Than Just Talk
## Abstract:
### Most of us can talk - we've been doing it since we were young.  Unfortunately there can be a huge gap between talking and effective communication.  While not all of us will be chosen for TED talks, there are methods we can use to keep our audience engaged and help our message to be understood whether you're asking your boss for a raise or presenting a session at the PASS Summit. Understand the barriers to effective communication and learn to use words, tone, expression and behavior to enhance your communicate skills.
