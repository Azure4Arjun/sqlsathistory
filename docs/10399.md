## Title: Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems
## Abstract:
### Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers?  After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels.  This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel.  No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools.  You can do this with the tools you have and Iâ€™ll give you the scripts to get started.  Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.
