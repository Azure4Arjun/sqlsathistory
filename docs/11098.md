## Title: Windows Azure from a Data Perspective
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure is an incredibly large set of features that technical professionals can use to solve almost any computing need. With that breadth of features, what can the data professional use to help their organizations with small, disconnected datasets all the way to "Big Data"? Buck Woody, Senior Technical Professional on the Windows Azure Platform at Microsoft and a technical professional with close to 30 years of data implementations shows you what you need to know to leverage Windows Azure from a data perspective - when to use it, when to leave your data on-site, and how to create hybrid solutions that encompass both architectures.
