## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server in Production
## Abstract:
### Virtualization has been growing in popularity for years and changes in Windows Server 2012 and ESX 5 make it so that even high end workloads that demand large amounts of memory, significant I/O, and lots of processing power can be virtualized.  With over 8 years of experience virtualizing SQL Server in production, SQL Server MVP Jonathan Kehayias knows what it takes to successfully virtualize SQL Server for production workloads.  This session will explain the features that make virtualizing SQL Server possible using both VMware and Hyper-V, and will explain the most common problems businesses encounter trying to virtualize SQL Server.
