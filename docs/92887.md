## Title: Using Azure Cosmos DB and DataBricks to provide Realtime Customer Matching
## Abstract:
### Find out how a major UK hotel chain unified their wildly different sources of customer data to build a supercharged automated customer communication engine. 

Cosmos DB and Databricks where used to process and match customer data in real-time, helping them get to know their customers, how best to retain them, and how best to keep them happy, all while ensuring GDPR compliance. 

Learn how downstream systems received customer identifiers allowing tailored content to be produced in near real time, and how business users consumed the insights via Power BI

Learn how scale up and scale down allowed us to meet challenges around massive initial data loads, without blowing the project budget. 

Find out what lessons were learned and what best practices helped ensure that the Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Event Hubs and Azure Databricks instances all played harmoniously together. Hear how we used partitioning, indexing, scaling and other cloud design patterns to deliver incredible performance.
