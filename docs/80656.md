## Title: Alexa – Skills Development, Data, and Continuous Improvement

### "Alexa, make Song Quiz smarter and more fun."

Alexa is fast growing to be the strongest of the three personal assistants.  Much of this growth has come from the fact that Amazon opened up 3rd party development through their Skills program. In this session, we’ll start with the Alexa ecosystem and terminology. We’ll then cover the infrastructure behind skills and development framework We’ll wrap things up with how to implement continuous improvement, by using data to drive it all!
