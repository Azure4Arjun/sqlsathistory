# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#888-Sioux-Falls-2019)
Event Date: 10-08-2019 - Session time: 16:05:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

# Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#888-Sioux-Falls-2019)
Event Date: 10-08-2019 - Session time: 16:05:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration
## Abstract:
### If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.

## Speaker: Kevin Mackey
## Title: Don't just code it—Generate It
## Abstract:
### Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?

## Title: Hidden Power: Service Broker
## Abstract:
### Service Broker is a robust asynchronous programming model that provides reliable messaging between SQL Server instances. Making life easier for developers creating sophisticated applications to communicate between databases and servers. 

With focusing on your basic database to database asynchronous messaging to more advance messaging across multiple servers, we are positive you will walk away with new knowledge about Service Broker. And just as positive we will learn something new with you. As some of you may know, Service Broker never ceases to surprise.
