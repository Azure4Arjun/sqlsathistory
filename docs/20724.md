## Speaker: Mike Huguet
## Title: SharePoint Primer for .NET Developers
## Abstract:
### This session will cover an introduction of the SharePoint architecture, details on the more common customization and extensibility areas for developers including application pages, JavaScript, event receivers, workflows, web parts, and field types. We will also cover different options for developing composite solutions leveraging SharePoint data and hosting of your applications in SharePoint. Due to the amount of content, this session is mostly at the architectural level. There will be some demos, but there will not be a lot of depth in one particular area. To gain the most value out of this session it is suggested that you be at least an intermediate level web developer and some experience using SharePoint basic functions as an end user.
