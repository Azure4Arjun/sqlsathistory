## Speaker: Shawn Harrison
## Title: SSIS Troubleshooting, Error Handling, and Logging
## Abstract:
### Encountering error messages in SSIS can be confusing and incredibly frustrating. Sometimes it’s difficult to determine what’s causing a problem and how to correct or avoid it if it happens again. As developers, we have a useful yet underrated set of tools to help us navigate many ETL pitfalls. In this session, Shawn will walk through a variety of tips and tricks to interpret errors during design time and demonstrate some common uses for event handling to help prevent problems after deployment.
