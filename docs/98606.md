## Title: Power BI for Data Scientists
## Abstract:
### Data Scientists often use a variety of tools to perform engineering and predictive modeling activities in their quest to squeeze as much value from data as possible. Although Power BI is sometimes seen as “just” a front-end visualization tool, its capabilities for data manipulation along with its interoperability with popular data science platforms make it a good choice for data experimentation on a broad set of scenarios.

This session will provide an overview of typical use cases that benefit from Power BI’s rich exploration capabilities in support of data science efforts. Attendees will learn about integration points between Power BI and data science platforms that can help uncover valuable business insights.
