## Title: Easier schema migrations, data migrations  more w/ Redgate tools
## Abstract:
### Managing data models and data for existing applications can be cumbersome and fraught with pitfalls. Many developers and DBAs rely on "change" scripts they produce manually whenever they need to deploy changes or updates. Though this might work well for small and infrequent changes, it's much harder to pull off with large teams, complex applications or applications that change all the time. In the world of software, we rely on source control and code-differencing tools. However, these tools are much less common when it comes to database schemas and data in databases. Enter RedGate tools: SQL Compare, SQL Data Compare and others. These tools allow the DBA to quickly "compare" databases (even data) and quickly generate "change scripts" that can be used to roll out changes and/or audit databases. In this session, we explore these tools and how I've integrated them in my workflow when supporting business applications. [Note I do not work for Redgate and this is not a vendor session.]
