## Title: Data Masking Algorithms Strengths
## Abstract:
### "All animals are created equal but some of the more equal than the other." - and so are algorithms. Data masking is used to secure privacy of data and brings data lifecycle processes into the compliance with HIPAA, FEPRA, GLBA , state and European regulations. Data masking uses a variety of algorithms. Each algorithm has a different strength and your understanding how secure the algorithms are  protects your organization from not only from non-compliance risks, but also from reputational and monetary damages - and it saves your job.
