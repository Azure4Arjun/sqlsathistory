## Speaker: Nicholas Cain
## Title: PowerShell: Are you checking out my profile?
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is a very powerful management tool and you can spend hours writing magical scripts to provide automation for frequently run tasks. Often forgotten is the PowerShell profile, a place you can add your own functions which can provide you lightning fast access to information. 
In this session we'll talk about the power a profile puts at your fingertips. I will also demo (and share) several PowerShell functions that I use frequently for common tasks like checking database backups and disk space. 
I'll show you my PowerShell profile if you show me yours.
