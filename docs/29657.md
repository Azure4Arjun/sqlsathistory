## Title: SQL Azure: Future-Proofing Your SQL Career
## Abstract:
### SQL Azure's not just coming; it's here. In your role as the local expert on all-things-SQL-Server, you will need to know how to talk intelligently about it. You may also want to be able to whip up an impromptu SQL Azure demo for co-workers and decision makers. This demo-heavy session will help get you to that point.

We'll look at what kind of usage scenarios work best for SQL Azure. We'll look at what SQL Azure does, and what it doesn't do. We walk through the process of creating, loading and querying databases, at what management tools are available, and how you will create and manage your account. We'll explore what cost-efficient ways there are for an individual to get access, and how to monitor the costs on an ongoing basis.
