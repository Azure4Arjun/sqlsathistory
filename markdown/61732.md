## Title: How to Setup and Manage a Corporate Self-Service Analytics Environment
## Abstract:
### As companies face the challenges arising from a surge in the number of customer interactions and data, it can be difficult to successfully manage the vast quantities of information and still provide a positive customer experience. It is incumbent upon businesses to create a consumer-centric experience that is powered by (predictive) analytics.

Adopting a data-driven approach through a corporate self-service analytics (SSA) environment is integral to strengthening your data and analytics strategy.
