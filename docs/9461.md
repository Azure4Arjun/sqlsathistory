## Title: DW Design Tips Slowly Changing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### In the session we are going to take on a challenging subject that all designers face: how to deal with changing dimensions. Unlike most OLTP systems, a major objective of a data warehouse is to track history. So, accounting for change is one of the analyst’s most important responsibilities. Ralph Kimball introduced the concept of slowly changing dimension (SCD) attributes in 1996. Dimensional modelers, in conjunction with the business’s data governance representatives, must specify the data warehouse’s response to operational attribute value changes.  In this session we will also explain “type numbers” assigned to several techniques that have been described in the past.
