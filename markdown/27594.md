## Title: Introduction to APS
## Abstract:
### We will have a conversation of what is APS and specifically how it differs from the normal SQL Server instances we work with daily.  By the end of this talk, you will have a very good understanding of the differences between the APS' MPP architecture compared to SMP SQL Server.  We will cover the topic of Polybase and what Hadoop Components are supported by Polybase.
