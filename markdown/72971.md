## Title: Applications of Hashbytes and Compress Functions
## Abstract:
### Both Hashbytes and Compress functions have some use cases that we should consider when designing and tuning databases.  These functions can be used to improve query performance, reduce storage, and enforce consistency.  We will walk through some examples where these functions have helped me and will hopefully help you in the future.
