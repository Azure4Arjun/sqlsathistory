## Title: Indexing Internals
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll dig into the internal structors of indexes.  We will explore the differences between clustered and non-clustered indexes, what's layed out within each page of the indexes and how the SQL Server uses the data within the indexes to find rows quickly.
