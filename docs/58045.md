## Title: SSIS Monitoring Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll see everything interesting is hidden in the SSISDB database, where you can gain a lot of insight on the outcome, the performance and the status of your SSIS Packages. I'll share everything I've learned building the SSIS Dashboard we're actually using in production and that you can test here http://ssis-dashboard.azurewebsites.net/. Weâ€™ll see the internals of SSISDB database, how we can add custom logging information and how we can use all these data in order to know exactly what happened on a specific point in time.
