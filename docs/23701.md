## Speaker: Rusty Frioux
## Title: Analytics 101 : Big data, business intelligence, and predictive analytics for decision makers
## Abstract:
### Business analytics is the hottest ticket in the IT world these days.  The trouble is, the industry doesn’t seem to agree on what “it” might be.  Is analytics jazzed up reporting and slick dashboards?  Is it statistical modeling?  Is it Hadoop?  Is it SAS?  Is it PowerView? What’s a poor technical manager to do when the C-Suite demands it?
Business analytics is the art and science of data driven decision making.  Analytics projects span corporate performance management, reporting, dashboarding, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, a/b experimentation, and a host of other techniques all designed to help organizations make fact based decisions using business data.  
Rusty Frioux from DataClear will sort out truth from hype and give some practical guidance for anyone tasked with starting an analytics initiative.
