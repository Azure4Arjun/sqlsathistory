## Speaker: Rodney Landrum
## Title: Bulk Loading SQL in Space (drive space)
## Abstract:
### This session will demonstrate the numerous ways to quickly and efficiently import and export large data volumes to SQL Server. Using BCP, BULK INSERT, OPENROWSET and third party tools, you will learn how to "minimally" log transactions to avoid run away log file growth as well as the best method to backup and restore large databases, 300GB or more. We will see how much we can fill a database in the course of the hour and discuss why we (or your business) would want to store so much data in the first place.
