## Speaker: Pat Phelan
## Title: Relational Data Architecture 101
## Abstract:
### This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.
