## Title: An (Advanced) Introduction to Dax
## Abstract:
### Coming from the Excel world, DAX can look like Excel formulas on steroids. However, to be successful with DAX and Powerpivot, you'll need a completely different mental model. In this introduction to DAX, we won't spend too much time on the basics. Instead, we'll focus the concepts that make DAX unique. This will help you avoid the stumbling blocks of working with DAX. We will cover calculated columns, measures, aggregations, filtering, and iterators.
