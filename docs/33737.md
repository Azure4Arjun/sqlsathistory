## Title: A PowerShell Cookbook for DBAs
## Abstract:
### This introduction to PowerShell is different than most.  Instead of starting with a full treatment of the language, you will receive a brief overview then a collection of "recipes," stand-alone PowerShell scripts that automate various administration tasks for SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008/2008R2.  You will learn by example, and quickly realize why investing a little time into learning PowerShell will make your job a great deal easier.
