## Speaker: MIKE DONNELLY
## Title: SSIS: Figuring Out Configuring
## Abstract:
### As with most things in the IT world there is more than one way to skin the SSIS configuration cat.* I'll focus on SQL Server 2008 methods (being called Package Deployment method in SQL 2012) and show how to use 1)XML config files or 2)an environment variable or registry entry that points to a config database. I'll also give a brief overview of the new project deployment method in SQL 2012.

*[No cats were skinned in the making of this presentation.]
