## Title: Data Types Do Matter
## Abstract:
### They're just numbers, right?  A date's a date.  It's just string data, who cares?  I can't tell you how many times I've heard these phrases.  This session will help you understand why choosing the correct data type for your data is so important.  It affects data quality, storage and performance.  It can even produce incorrect query results.
