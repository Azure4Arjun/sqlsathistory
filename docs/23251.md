## Title: Getting Started With SQL Server Replication
## Abstract:
### In this session we will examine how SQL Server replication works.  A technology that has been around, this tool is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's an excellent way to keep a subset of data synched with another database without having to synch the entire thing (although you could if you wanted to!).  We will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of different replication pieces so you can implement this technology in your environment.
