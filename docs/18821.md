## Title: BIML â€“ the best friend of SSIS developers
## Abstract:
### Many BI developers use SSIS. It's great tool. But exists many routine tasks. For example, you need create package for incremental updating of 10 tables. You did it. But structure of tables was changed. Or you need add to package 5 (or may be 50) additional tables. In this situation you need help. And you have new assistant. His name is BIML (Business Intelligence Markup Language).
