## Speaker: Peter Willmot
## Title: Developing effective IoT back-end services with SQL Server and .Net
## Abstract:
### In this session Peter Willmot (who has developed embedded/IoT and similar applications with SQL back-ends for many years) will help you to understand some of the opportunities that SQL (and, to a lesser extent,  .Net) offer when you need to design and build effective, scalable and secure IoT back-end platforms with SQL Server.

The session content covers various aspects of a typical SQL IoT back-end notably including:
- working work binary-opaque data streams using SQL CLR
- leveraging SQL Service Broker and Queues for CQRS and deferred aggregation scenarios
- consistent JSON handling across SQL versions
- selecting optimal data types and indexes for IoT-typical data structures
