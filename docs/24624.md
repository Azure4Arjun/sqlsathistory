## Speaker: Shannon Lowder
## Title: OnPremise to Azure
## Abstract:
### During this talk I'll walk you through the process actually used to migrate a client's systems from hosted in a company closet to multiple Microsoft Azure data centers.  Along the way we'll discuss the planning that went into the migration, the testing we went through, the pain points we hit,  all the way to up and running in the cloud. This session covers the roadmap, we won't go through the actual migration itself...that took almost a year to complete.
