## Title: Using Expressions to Avoid Three SSRS Annoyances
## Abstract:
### As powerful as it is, SQL Server Reporting Services still has frustrating annoyances. Three in particular are: 1) non-queried parameter values must be entered one value at a time, with lots of clicking along with way; 2) the page header and page footer sections cannot contain data regions and therefore cannot display sets of data-driven values; and 3) matrix reports promise the analytical ability of Excel PivotTables but fall short because they are fixed and lack the ability to dynamically slice-and-dice data by values selected by the user. With the expression techniques taught in this session, these annoyances will annoy no longer because you will be able to work around all three.
