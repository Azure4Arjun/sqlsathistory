## Title: Transitioning from SQL Trace to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Extended Events were introduced with SQL Server 2008, but without a UI, which meant using T-SQL to create and manage them and using XPath and XQuery to parse the output.  Microsoft has added an Extended Events UI in SQL Server 2012 and also added additional events.  With the announcement that SQL Trace/Profiler is being deprecated now is the time to begin learning Extended Events.  This session will show you how to take existing Traces and convert them to Extended Event Sessions.
