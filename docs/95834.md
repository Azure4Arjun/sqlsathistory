## Title: Automate your Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### A typical machine learning experiment involves the following phases - data preparation, algorithm selection, model training, model testing and hyperparameter tuning. The process is usually repeated for a range of machine learning algorithms and then the most optimum model is selected for scoring. This model needs to be exposed to client applications – in SQL Server the model can stored in a table and then wrapped in a stored procedure, while models built using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn can be exposed through REST APIs.

The machine learning lifecycle is iterative and often time-consuming. What if there was a way to automate some of the processes involved so that the outcome could be generated sooner? In this session, you will see Automated Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure in action. You’ll get to learn key concepts and takeaway enough knowledge to be able to run simple machine learning experiments.
