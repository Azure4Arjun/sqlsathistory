## Title: Migration path from SQL Server Instance on Azure VM (IaaS) towards Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)
## Abstract:
### Database migration path from SQL Server Instance on Azure VM (IaaS) towards Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS).
DMA (Assessment), DEA (Capture the trace / Replay the trace / Analyze), DMS (Migrate database)

Data Migration Assistant (DMA)
Use DMA tool to detect potential compatibility issues which may impact database functionality after migration to Azure SQL managed Instance.

Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA)
Evaluate targeted version of SQL Server instance for a specific workload, in this example Azure SQL Managed Instance.
Create workload from the source SQL Server Instance using Extended Events XEL trace, replay that workload against the targeted Azure SQL Managed Instance, and then create report and analyze those two traces.

Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)
Use Azure DMS as end-to-end solution for migrating source SQL Server databases to the cloud, in this example from SQL Server Instance on Azure VM (IaaS) towards Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS).
