## Title: Compliance and Auditing in Sql Server
## Abstract:
### I have this database which must meet all of these governmental regulations.  Just like the government to make life a lot harder but wait, now they say I most also meet International regulations.  Can this be true?  Why me?  Let's look at what we can do to help us pass audits and comply with the laws around us.  I need to install TDE, what do I do? Move the database to other server, can I do that?  I used certificates, can I change them.  I don’t like governments making me do all this stuff, it complicates my database.  What does TDE do to my backups?  Can I remove it? Auditing, no, let’s run for the hills.  Let’s see how Sql Server can help us with these issues.
