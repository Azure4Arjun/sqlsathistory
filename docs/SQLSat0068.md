# Managing Sparse Resources with Resource Governor
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 151
## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: Managing Sparse Resources with Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing the resources on their systems in order to ensure that they are being followed and resources are accessible when needed. SQL Server 2008 provides Resource Governor, which allows the DBA to discretely manage system resources in a very structured way. In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features as well as demonstrate some of the pitfalls and helpful hints that you will need in order to successfully implement this fascinating tool.

# Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 252
## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture 
## Abstract:
### Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.

## Speaker: Buck Woody
## Title: Cloud computing for the Data Professional
## Abstract:
### The term “Cloud Computing” has become so polluted that it has come to mean “web”. How do you de-tangle all the hype and vendor terms and determine when and where you can use it? Buck Woody, a Senior Technical Specialist in Distributed Computing at Microsoft will explain your options – and describe the information you need to take back to your organization.

# Strategies for Working with VLDBs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 352
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: Strategies for Working with VLDBs
## Abstract:
### Very large databases (VLDBs) are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love. Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer and minor issues become major very quickly. In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to minimize your maintenance window requirements, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas. Demos will include how I set up a log shipping secondary and a replica of a 2 TB database in less than half an hour.

# Get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 351
## Speaker: Diane Robey
## Title: Get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition
## Abstract:
### How can you get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition? The SQL Server Enterprise Edition (EE) is far more expensive than the Standard Edition (SE). Many small office applications use SE. What features do you really need for your database system? Many features that are only available in EE, such as partitioning and data compression, are specific to managing larger databases. If you do not have very large databases, perhaps SE will be sufficient. Find out what actually improves performance for SE.

# Through the Looking-Glass 
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 252
## Speaker: Greg Larsen
## Title: Through the Looking-Glass 
## Abstract:
### "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" - When your world is SQL Server, you need a looking-glass to determine server health, diagnosis problems, and tune performance. In this session will we follow Alice through the looking-glass to determine what she finds in SQLServerLand. Alice will be using dynamic management views and functions (DMVs) to explore the land behind the looking-glass. She will find statistics, poorly performing queries, and much more. Follow Alice and her new friends, as she traverses across SQLServerLand and provides you with snippets of T-SQL code that you can use to explore your own SQLServerLand.

# Visual Report Design: Bringing Sexy Back
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#68-Olympia-2011)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: 151
## Speaker: Paul Turley
## Title: Visual Report Design: Bringing Sexy Back
## Abstract:
### Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades? Stop living in the past and make your reports pop. Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports. Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let business users explore the details to gain insight and take action. Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports. With a little simple programming code, these design techniques apply to big analytic solutions  smaller-scale operational reports.
