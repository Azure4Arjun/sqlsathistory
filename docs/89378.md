## Title: â€œPast, Present and Future of the Data Profession"
## Abstract:
### In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we forgot that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom. 
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? What is a Data Engineer? What is a Data Analyst? Which skills do we need?
