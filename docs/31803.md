## Title: Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records 
## Abstract:
### Perhaps you inherited a database with one or more tables having duplicate potential keys or maybe even entire duplicate records or maybe you generated a recordset from a SELECT statement that has duplicate records. In any case, you have a problem. You need to identify which tables have duplicate records or duplicate index values, isolate those records, and then delete only the duplicate records from the table. This session will focus on the functions and methods that you can use to identify and remove duplicate data from your tables
