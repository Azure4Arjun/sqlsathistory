# “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-861)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance
## Abstract:
### This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 1st of two back-to-back sessions, we'll learn how the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory/disk space, costly/continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance and how it all negatively impacts your code even if it’s perfect code.

We'll also discover the true costs of page splits, how REORGANIZE can perpetuate them, their effect on performance, introduce and learn how to use "sp_IndexDNA" to see indexes as you've never seen them before, and introduce methods to make even active GUID-based indexes 100% fragmentation free for months at a time, which will also fix the problems we’ve discovered.

This 1st session is also a recommended segue into the second session.

## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.

## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: “Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.
## Abstract:
### This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 2nd of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn the 5 main “Insertion Patterns” and how they cause or prevent fragmentation, introduce the additional page splitting/fragmenting horror of “ExpAnsive Updates”, continue to learn about the true costs of using REORGANIZE and why it should be avoided, how it all affects performance and disk/memory usage, how it all affects Index Maintenance, and steps that can be taken to seriously improve all of that. 

We'll also learn that simply reducing Fill Factors isn't the "fix" for fragmentation and can actually cost you serious amounts of additional totally wasted memory while providing little to no value.

Unfortunately, there won’t be time to cover it all but well documented code will be provided to help identify the sources of page splits and “ExpAnsive Updates” so that they can be eliminated.

Session #1 is a strongly recommend prerequisite for this session.

## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Extending Your Use of Extended Events
## Abstract:
### If you have made the leap to using Extended Events, chances are you’re using Extended Events to do the exact same thing you used to do in Trace. Maybe you use it to capture query performance over time, or find queries that exceed a specific duration, I/O, or CPU.  Maybe you want to find what login executed a query, or from what workstation or application the query originated.  But Extended Events is so much more than a replacement for trace; it is a whole new way to think about troubleshooting.

In this session we will discuss the targets, actions, and predicates available in Extended Events and see how you can leverage them to look at problems in SQL Server in ways that you never could before. We will step through as many demos as possible in the time available so you can see why joining Team XE was one of the best decisions you ever made.  You’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of Extended Events along with a new methodology for approaching and solving issues in SQL Server.

Basically, the CI/CD process helps to establish a good software development practice and aims to build a healthy relationship between development, quality assurance, and other supporting teams.

Let's explore how we can use Microsoft DevOps and GitHub to build and release our ADF pipelines to other environments.

Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Kerry Tyler
## Title: 45 Minutes to Your First Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the Azure Analysis Services product? Power BI's data modeling? These technologies are all effectively the same, but live in different places and can serve different roles. Now's the time to dive in and figure all of this out.
In this session, we will talk about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various "flavors" it comes in. We'll explore development processes and will wind up with a model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.

# Classification With Naive Bayes
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-861)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Classification With Naive Bayes
## Abstract:
### The Naïve Bayes series of algorithms are some of the simplest classification algorithms, but they tend to offer reasonably good results very quickly for a number of problems, including Natural Language Processing problems such as spam classification, as well as more classical feature-driven classification.  In this talk, we will look at the math behind Naïve Bayes classification, solving problems by hand before looking at a package in R which solves the problem for us.  By the end of this talk, you should be able to apply Naïve Bayes to existing problems.  No experience with statistics is required, although there will be a small amount of math.

# Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-861)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Sam Nasr
## Title: Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.

# Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-861)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Ben Weissman
## Title: Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!
## Abstract:
### Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… :)

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages or ADF pipelines, this is the right session for you!

# Hey, You Got Your TDD in my SQL DB!
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-861)
Event Date: 08-06-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Jeff McKenzie
## Title: Hey, You Got Your TDD in my SQL DB!
## Abstract:
### When should we test our data? From an application development perspective, a unit test against a database isn't a unit test at all. Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.
