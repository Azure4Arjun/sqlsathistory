## Abstract:
### Have you ever been thinking that you would like to be able to do more in SQL Server than what T-SQL allows you to do? If that is the case, the this session is for you!
Here we look at the SQL Server Extensibility Framework, and we see how we can call out to external languages from inside SQL Server. We look at R, Python and Java, and what we can do from SQL Server having access to those languages.
