## Speaker: Cameron Snapp
## Title: Azure Data Engineering
## Abstract:
### As Microsoft releases new Azure features, migrating your ETL processes to the cloud is becoming easier all the time, but also more confusing.  Understanding the use and connectivity of the different storage and services is more critical than ever.  I'll start with an overview of Azure data components, detail how they can be integrated, and demo the lift and shift of existing SSIS packages to Azure.  I'll also demo some dynamic ways to program Data Factory and the features of the brand new Data Factory Data Flow!  Throughout, we'll discuss best practices for different Azure centric data migration strategies and explore the benefits of adopting an ELT approach.
