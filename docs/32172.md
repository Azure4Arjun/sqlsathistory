## Speaker: Paul Turley
## Title: Visual Report Design: Bringing Sexy Back
## Abstract:
### Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades? Stop living in the past and make your reports pop. Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports. Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let business users explore the details to gain insight and take action. Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports. With a little simple programming code, these design techniques apply to big analytic solutions  smaller-scale operational reports.
