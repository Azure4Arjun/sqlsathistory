## Speaker: Tim Hidalgo
## Title: Baseline,  Like a Boss
## Abstract:
### When you are analyzing your database servers, how do you quantify performance gains or losses?  After you've made a change, do you wait for your users to tell you if things are better or worse?  Do you implement every “best practice” based on an author’s popularity?    Join Tim M. Hidalgo for a presentation on the why, how and “what then…” of baselining and the benefits of making informed decisions.
