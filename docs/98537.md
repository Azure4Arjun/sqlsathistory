## Speaker: Erik Darling
## Title: Total Server Performance Tuning
## Abstract:
### You've been working with SQL Server for a few years, and you're sick and tired of not being able to understand how it all works. Every day, you stare at monitoring tool charts and graphs, wait stats, and widgets, and none of it seems to add up. In this fast paced full day of demos, I'm going to show you how queries interact with your server, and each other. You'll discover that concurrency isn't just about locking and blocking; concurrency is also about hardware. I'm going to teach you how to diagnose your worst server issues and practical ways to solve them.
