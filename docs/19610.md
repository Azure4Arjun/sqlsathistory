## Title: Architecting Real-Time Data Warehouses with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most data warehouses are scheduled to update periodically, such as once nightly.  Others need to be refreshed in real-time, providing business users with up to the minute reports and analytics.  This session will review the architecture required to construct a dimensional data warehouse, source it with real-time ETL using Change Data Capture (CDC), and query it efficiently from various reporting tools.  It will cover advanced topics such as managing concurrent reads/writes using RCSI, storing real-time aggregates using indexed views, avoiding deadlocks using application locking, and other real-world construction/tuning/maintenance issues inherent in a real-time system.
