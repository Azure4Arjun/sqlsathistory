## Title: SQL SERVER 2016 / 2017 AND AZURE SQL DB: SECURITY ALL UP
## Abstract:
### We will cover many security features in SQL Server 2016/2017 such as Row Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking, Always Encrypted, Advanced Threat Detection, and the Azure Security Center covering SQL Server. 
 
Row-Level Security enables customers to control access to rows based on the characteristics of the user executing a query. RLS enables you to implement restrictions on data row access. Dynamic Data Masking limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data stored in a SQL database. Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine.
 
We will cover the Azure Security Center and Advanced Threat Detection which can be used to provide a dashboard for viewing  responding to security risks. The benefits of include configuration of SQL threat detection policy, email alerts, Azure Portal and Excel integration.
