## Title: Master Data Management with SQL Master Data Services (MDS) and Ma
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will focus on how to formulate a Master Data Management (MDM) strategy and build a solution to find the single version of the truth, aka the Golden Record. While these techniques can apply to any data domain, we will demonstrate building a sample customer domain, showing how to leverage SQL Server Master Data Services (MDS) and other tools for data quality, matching, and de-duplication across multiple data sources.
