### [ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
High Availability solutions have been around for nearly as long as SQL Server and with “Maintenance Windows” becoming an increasingly rare luxury, businesses are relying more and more on their Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence reporting platforms being available 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.

In this pre-conference session we shall explain how to design, plan, implement and maintain an end-to-end Highly Available Business Intelligence and analytic platform laying not only the conceptual foundations for your learning, but providing the practical technical hands on know-how for Business Intelligence professionals, Database (and Windows) administrators, and Technical Architects.
