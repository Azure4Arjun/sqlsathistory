## Speaker: Paresh Motiwala
## Title: TempDB- More permanent impact than you think
## Abstract:
### As a DBA you hear different theories and "gospel truths" about TempDB from many people. Frankly there is no single version of the truth except that if you don't use and manage it well, it will make your life a real h*ll.
What works for you in one situation may not work for you in another situation. What works for a situation today, might not guarantee its success for a similar situation tomorrow.

We will talk about 
Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?
Trace Flags to Manage Tempdb?
Should we store the entire Tempdb on SSDs?
Should we shrink TempDB or not?

Hopefully at the end of the session your knowledge on Tempdb won't be Temp.
