## Title: Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure Drone
## Abstract:
### Hybrid Data and Analytics via a SQL Server 2017  Azure-Controlled Drone

Using SQL Server 2017, we will control a drone via NodeJS.  With the help of Python and ML we will then make the drone fly in the "Safe Zone". 

Join me in a presentation on how to create your Azure environment for data and analytics using the first ever drone controlled by SQL Server 2017. 

- creating a template to make proofs of concept possible
- real world situations and lessons learned in Azure
- consumption of that data through Power BI

This presentation will include creation of a hybrid solution for operational analytics both on-prem and cloud using Azure SQL Database in-memory and temporal tables to create the ultimate data and analytics experience.

## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps
## Abstract:
### We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for inserts? Are they ever a good idea? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.

# Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics

## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics
## Abstract:
### Have your tables and indexes that have grown rather large? Are they taking longer to query? Are your windows for maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, table partitioning may be for you!
With table partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and sliding windows. You'll see how we can make our index and statistics maintenance easier. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and be able to make decisions on how and when to implement.

## Title: SQL Server on Containers – Part 1
## Abstract:
### Windows 16 introduced containers which has started a new era which will help with VM consolidation big time, the future of SQL Implementations is about installing SQL Server on Windows 16 NANO Server running as containers. It provides an isolated, resource controlled, predictable and portable operating environment inside a VM.

SQL server 2017 with complete support for creating containers using Dockers, a defacto industry standard API for container packaging is to allow running SQL Server as micro-services. Docker has industry-wide support with hosted services on Azure/AWS, monitoring, logging, orchestration. No matter you want to deploy SQL server on Linux or windows containers are the way…

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBA/Developers understand the basics of containers and windows 16 NANO servers running SQL Server 2016  17. in subsequent session Prakash will cover several demos and share scripts to start with containers

## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: A DBAs guide to the proper handling of corruption
## Abstract:
### Corruption can strike at any time. As DBAs how we alert, investigate, and respond can have profound impact on our company. In this session we will learn how to detect and respond to various types of corruption.
First we will be focus on ways to detect corruption early. This will include understanding tools available to us like DBCC CheckDB as well as the importance of testing your backups. We’ll look at some sample scripts to automate corruption checks and common alerts we should have set up on our instances.

Then we will move onto how to respond to some common example of corruption through live demos.  We’ll look at how we can analyze the situation safely as well as point out various pitfalls that trip people up. We’ll also discuss when and how we may be able to fix corruption vs restoring the database.

## Speaker: Jason Brimhall
## Title: Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.

## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

## Title: Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?
## Abstract:
### Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.

### In this session, we'll show the power of this Azure MPP solution.  T-SQL is a great data language that makes parallelism easy.  C# is a fantastic statically typed language that taps into the power of the .NET framework, but parallelism has a big barrier to entry.  Learn how U-SQL combines the best of both worlds to clean and analyze data at incredible levels.  Azure Data Lake Analytics makes Hadoop affordable and easy by leveraging your existing knowledge of T-SQL and C#.

## Speaker: Eric Freeman
## Title: SSIS Process Automation Design for the T-SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### This session is geared towards T-SQL developers who are interested in ETL framework or process automation. In this session we will go over how to create a single SSIS package that can be used for process flow automation without the need to constantly update the SSIS package whenever there is a change. When something happens, something or multiple things need to happen. The architecture that will be presented is powered by tables, stored procedures and recursive CTEs.

## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight
## Abstract:
### This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.
