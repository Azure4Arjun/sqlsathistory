## Title: Virtualizing SQL 2012: Doing It Right
## Abstract:
### A database is a very resource intensive by its very nature and one of the most resource intensive applications you will ever virtualize. If it is not done correctly you will not be successful. This presentation will teach the DBA how to do it right. We will discuss why you virtualize a database, using the right hypervisor, installation, Architecting for performance, the storage layer, the processor, Memory considerations, the network layer and end with SQL Server 2012 licensing. This presentation focuses on VMware but much of the information is relevant in any virtualized environment.
