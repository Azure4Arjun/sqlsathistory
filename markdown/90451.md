## Title: What just happened? Creating your own real-time dashboard with Grafana, Influx, and Telegraf
## Abstract:
### Like many of you, I've been fortunate enough to work in places where the budgets were non-existent, the systems were always crashing, and what tools we did have, were good for some, not all.  For those fighting fires and wearing multiple hats, you're used to, but still scared of "hey, what just happened?"    

In this session, I'll show you how to install, configure, and build your own dashboard with Grafana, and utilize InfluxDB and Telegraf, which I believe will help you fight your fires better than before.  If you're like me, you've at times wished you had a way to easily display and create your own metrics, and after this, you'll be well on your way to do so.  You can also integrate in monitoring, alerting, and so much more, all for the low, low, price of whatever your time is worth.
