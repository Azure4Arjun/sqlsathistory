## Title: Annoyed with a stubborn pivot table? PowerPivot is your answer.
## Abstract:
### This session is for you if you’ve ever built an amazing data set that was everything you needed, but then you went to create a dashboard, you got annoyed by any of the following:

-Your boss won’t approve the costs to get PowerBI Desktop.
-You’re not a coder, so learning R or Python sounds super scary
-You add a whole bunch of columns to your data set and now your file size is gargantuan 
-You add a field to a pivot table and the grand total row makes no reasonable sense
-Your average between two dates is 2.6166666667; how many hours and minutes is that?
-You add a date field to a pivot table and the month names get sorted alphabetically
-You add a graph to your dashboard, but have to add a table that will be hidden from a user later
-The two new pivot tables make your dashboard looks out of whack

Providing an overview of the above, the demos will give an insight into how powerful PowerPivot, PowerBI, and DAX can be.  I'll provide cool tricks and new ideas on what to search
