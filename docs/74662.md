## Abstract:
### The session covers an overview about the best practices and features of 3 amazing Visuals in Power BI.
1. ArcGIS Maps - bring your data on a powerful Map with additional custom layers.
2. SandDance - play with your data as never before. Create new dimensions on the fly and play your insights as an animation.
3. Synoptic Panel - prepare any image to act as a filter. Got a plane image and want to bind each seat individually to your Dataset? Go ahead and try Synoptic Panel.
