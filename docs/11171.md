## Title: Standalone to High-Availability Clusters over Lunch—with Time to Spare
## Abstract:
### Don’t miss this demonstration of the hot new container technology that will change your assumptions about what it takes to implement high-availability clusters. Join DH2i’s Carl Berglund as he transforms standalone SQL Server instances of different versions and editions into an automated HA cluster failing over between systems—in just a few minutes. In fact, he’ll have plenty of time left over to show you some other cool tricks with his new cluster, such as: QoS controls at the instance level, SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start, and multi-subnet geo-clustering capabilities. And you’ll still have time to grab dessert.
