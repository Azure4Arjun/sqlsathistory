## Title: Inside xVelocity In-Memory Analytics Engine
## Abstract:
### The xVelocity engine used by SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular, Power BI, and Power Pivot, is a columnar database capable of incredible performances, both in speed and compression ratio. In this session, we will perform a deep dive in the internals of the database architecture, discovering how Vertipaq stores information, in order to gain better insights into the engine and understand the best way to model your data warehouse to leverage the features of VertiPaq. We will show common and useful techniques to increase the compression ratio and obtain better performances from your Tabular data model.
