## Title: SQL Server Backup in the Era of the Cloud
## Abstract:
### Backup? Who cares! Now and Then? We store our data in the cloud. Somewhere in the Cloud. Which Cloud? Who cares! But we are still SQL Server Professionals, so... are we need backup? Should we use newest opportunities or old methods? Are we going step further or step back? On my session I will try to find answers for all of those (and more) questions. Demos, cases and examples from world of backup. And of course worst practices.
