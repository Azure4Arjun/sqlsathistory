## Title: Getting Started With Service Broker
## Abstract:
### Since SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has implemented a feature known as Service Broker that provides a very sophisticated message queuing service. In this session, we will unearth what is one of the least used features in your SQL Server toolbox and show you how you can implement it in your own environment through a series of real world examples. Along the way, you'll learn how to leverage the technology not only for single server queuing but also for server to server database queuing as well. This is sure to be a real eye opener for some whom have never had the time to dig into this fascinating piece of technology.
