## Title: Synapse Analytics: Beyond the Basics
## Abstract:
### Let's discover how to configure Synapse Analytics in order to achieve better result from the MPP environment, going beyond the default configuration

Synapse Analytics, which is way beyond the former Azure SQL Data Warehouse, is focused on MPP, Multi Parallel Processing, being a very powerful environment for Data Warehouse processing. It's former name, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, usually pushed many DW and BI developers to use this powerful tool in order to build a Data Warehouse. However, just implementing the logical design of a Data Warehouse inside an MPP environment can be very deceiving, because many default settings for the MPP environment will not be at their best. On this session you will see how to configure the MPP environment to achieve it's best performance for your Data Warehouse. You will understand the importance to understand and control the distributions by compute nodes, how critical are the correct choice of resource classes and users, the benefits to correct manage.  https://speakerscore.com/Z111
