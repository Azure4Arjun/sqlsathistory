## Title: Unstructured Data  Deep Learning
## Abstract:
### Many companies are trying to still figure out just how sophisticated they need to be about their data. While companies like Narrative Science ($29M raised), InsideSales.com ($143M raised), and many others aim to bring advanced analytics as a service deeply integrated into their products. Together we'll take a look at the cost/benefit of going from a simple classifier to a more complex deep learning approach to keyword relevance in a simple proof of concept around predicting and optimizing responses in email and tweets.
