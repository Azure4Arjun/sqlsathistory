## Title: Azure Data Factory: Ingestion Framework
## Abstract:
### You're going to learn how to design an Ingestion Framework capable of scaling multiple sources without additional pipelines to populate Azure Data Lake. We will walk through Ingestion Strategy, the Ingestion Model, and the Ingestion Pipelines that fully automate data lake ingestion.

Ingestion Strategy - First, we will lay the foundation for best practices when it comes to ingesting data and storing data within Azure Data Lake. 

Ingestion Model - Second, we will learn how to design a metadata model framework built using Data Vault techniques to capture and store data from across the business.

Ingestion Pipelines - Finally, we will build two Data Factory pipelines that read from the framework and does that actual data ingestion, these are built so that we only ever have to build these two pipelines when scaling to a new source type.
