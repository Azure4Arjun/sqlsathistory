## Title: Power Query: The ETL bit of Microsoft Self-Service
## Abstract:
### Power Query is an Information Worker focused ETL Tool integrated in Excel 2013. We will show this cool new tool to mash up data from different data sources (from Active Directory to Windows Azure Marketplace , from SQL Server to Files in a directory) and using the transformation capabilities of PQ. We will take a closer look to “M” the scripting language behind this Excel Add In and how you use it to do some pretty cool stuff.
