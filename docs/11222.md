## Title: Making your SSIS Fly Beyond the Sky
## Abstract:
### How fast can an ETL package be? How big of a dataset is too big that make us wait several hours to load data? Remember those properties that you never touched because you were afraid to break something else? Well, let's try them. In this demo-rich presentation, we'll focus on some 101 tips that will maximize your package throughput. We will also go deeper toward a 200-300 level, when we will walk through some very interesting database design patterns that will ultimately affect the performance of your SSIS.
