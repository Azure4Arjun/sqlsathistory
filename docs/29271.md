## Title: Leadership Coaching: A repeatable methodology...
## Abstract:
### Leadership coaching is the practice of using relational influence, the people kind, not the database kind, to develop and empower adult leaders. Coaching embraces a set of structured techniques designed to help you make other people more effective in reaching their goals and developing as leaders and can be a powerful tool for developing and managing teams in a technical environment.
