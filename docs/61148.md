## Title: Change Data Capture, maybe you should consider it again.
## Abstract:
### Change Data Capture (CDC) was released with SQL Server 2008 and has been enhanced in several subsequent releases of SQL Server. Sever Stored Procedures were first provided to aid in using CDC with ETL and/or other CDC related processes. SQL Server 2012 included the release of the CDC Source and several other SSIS Task that greatly simplified the process of using CDC in your ETL. In this session, I want to share some of the creative uses I have seen involving CDC and hear about some of the things you have seen and or done with it.
