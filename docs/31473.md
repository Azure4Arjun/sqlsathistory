# SQLSaturday #44 - Huntington Beach 2010
Event Date: 24-04-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Kevin Stephenson
## Title: Locks, Blocks, Deadlocks and Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### Concurrency management is a fundamental function of RDBMs. In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses locking to manage the conflicting goals of concurrency and ACID compliance. You will learn about the different lockable resource types, lock granularities and modes, and how the selection of transaction isolation levels modulates locking behavior. A novel locking pattern used at MySpace called READ UNTIL will be described. You will also be given a demonstration of troubleshooting techniques using documented and undocumented features, along with a research technique to help further your own locking knowledge.
