## Title: Database Restores - Lessons from the Real World
## Abstract:
### Having consistent, regular, verified backups are only a starting point. When failures happen - and they will happen - can you recover your database?  In this presentation we will dive into the mechanics of database restores and discuss how choices made previously in database/server/backup design can have profound effects on how ( what) you can recover.  We will also discuss spectacular ways to fail miserably... all in the hopes of preventing those same failures in the future.
