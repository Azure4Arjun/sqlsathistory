## Title: Azure Data Factory, your data pipeline in the cloud
## Abstract:
### Before data can be analyzed it must first be converted and copied into a format and a location where the analysis is the easiest. ETL tools (Extract, Transform, Load) make this possible. But if the data is needed in the cloud, itâ€™s best to run the ETL in the cloud as well.
Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based ETL tool, allowing data to be copied from on-premises as well as cloud based locations. Transformations can be hand-coded, but recently Microsoft added data flows to the product, which allow you to do data transformations without the need to write custom code.
In this session you will see the product in action and learn how to get started building your own flows.
