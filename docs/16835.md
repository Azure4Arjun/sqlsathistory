## Title: Taming Complex Tasks with the Psake Module
## Abstract:
### PSake is a PowerShell module that helps you work with a tree of interdependent tasks.  Originally designed for software builds, the simple workflow-as-tasks model lends itself to solving many other complex problems, such as VM provisioning, database setup and migration, even installing software.

In this session we will explore the PSake module, specifically learning how we can use the module to make small work out of a versioned SQL database migration.  You will learn how to translate a complex problem into a set of reusable and interrelated tasks, how to make your tasks discoverable, and how to manage large numbers of tasks in your workflow.
