## Title: 101 Stupid Things Your Colleagues Do When Setting Up A SQL Server
## Abstract:
### There are some things that you just wish your colleagues had known before they set up and installed SQL Server.  A successful installation of SQL Server requires more than someone accepting all the default options or clicking Next a bunch of times; proper choices need to be made.  In this session you'll learn from the mistakes of others as well as best-practice configurations across the entire infrastructure stack (Physical server, storage, virtualization, OS, and SQL Server layers) in order to ensure stable performance.  This session is for the accidental DBA or anyone who needs to install SQL Server occasionally (or for their colleagues who need to mop up afterwards).
