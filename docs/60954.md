## Title: Are you down with MPP? - Part 1 - Hadoop Based Solutions
## Abstract:
### Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures allow the use of large numbers of processors (or computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously.  MPP architectures can help with the processing and aggregation of large volumes of data with varying shapes, but can be complicated and costly to deploy and maintain.  We'll explore using the Microsoft Azure cloud as a platform for quickly creating cost-effective MPP solutions.  We will use Microsoft Azure to deploy and process data with a Hadoop based MMP architecture (using HDInsight).  The pros and cons of Hadoop based MPP, as well as when a company might choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering over an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution.  This talk will be packed full of demos and real-world learnings.
