## Title: Boosting SSAS productivity with Tabular Editor
## Abstract:
### Authoring SSAS tabular models using the standard tools (SSDT) can be a pain when working with large models. Tabular Editor is an open-source alternative, that relies only on the Model.bim metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM). Compared to SSDT, making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" experience, making it much easier to manage and author large models. In this session, we will briefly go over the basic features, and then dive into the productivity enhancing features of Tabular Editor, such as scripting, custom actions, the Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more. You will never want to use Visual Studio for Tabular Modelling ever again! Attendees will also have the opportunity to ask questions or provide feedback about the tool.
