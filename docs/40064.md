## Title: SQL Server 2016 - New Feature Preview
## Abstract:
### Be the first on the block to try the shiny new features coming in SQL Server 2016.

We'll review how you can get up and running with the SQL Server 2016 Community Technology Preview and play with all of the new toys.

Time travel with Temporal Tables. Watch the gears turn with Live Query Statistics. Go shopping in the Query Store. And impress your developer friends with some freshly minted JSON.

Maybe we'll even figure out how to bottle up that new version smell.
