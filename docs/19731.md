## Title: Thinking Out of the Box: Manage SQL Server Using Built-in Tools
## Abstract:
### It’s often the case that your budget doesn’t stretch far enough for all the great third party tools that help manage your SQL Servers. So, how can the in-built components of SQL Server help you with your daily tasks?

Policy Management, Data Collector and Extended Events, all included in both Enterprise and Standard Editions, provide a framework to keep your configurations consistent and give you some insights into the performance of your SQL Server instances. In this session, we will see how to make use of these components to formalize your configuration and track some performance attributes.

After this session you’ll be able to build out an effective management and monitoring toolkit using only “out-of-the-box” features.
