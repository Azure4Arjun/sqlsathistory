## Speaker: Eric Wisdahl
## Title: SSIS Configurations, Expressions and Constraints
## Abstract:
### This session will look in depth at some of the more powerful aspects of Integrations Services: Expressions, Package Configurations, and Precedence Constraints. A short tutorial will show the users how to build up a package structure to allow logging to a remote location determined through configurations as well as capturing errors, destroying the error file if no errors are present and emailing a configurable user if any errors are found.
