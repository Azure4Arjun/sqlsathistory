## Title: Epidemic Plague: Superficial Indexing [EN]
## Abstract:
### Proper indexing is a very time and cost-effective way to improve SQL performance. Yet hardly anyone gets it right or knows how different ways to write a query affects indexing and performance. In this session I'll explain why this knowledge is sparse and what developers can do about it. Finally we will go through the most important indexing mistakes by example and discuss them during a short live quiz with the audience.
