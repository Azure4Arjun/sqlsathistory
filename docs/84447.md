## Title: Using In-Memory OLTP in Production workloads!
## Abstract:
### In-Memory OLTP has come a long way since it was first introduced in SQL Server 2014. Many of the early restrictions have been lifted, but still fear and uncertainty of adoption into Production environments exists.

In this session, we will explain and demonstrate when, how, and where you should use In-Memory OLTP to improve your SQL Server performance. We will discuss using it in real-world production scenarios, highlighting administrator best practices, and developer use cases and considerations.
