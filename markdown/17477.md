## Title: Azure Development - Soup to Nuts
## Abstract:
### Joe Mack from Sogeti will be giving a demo of an end-to-end development scenario using Microsoft's cloud offerings. You'll see how to create and deploy an ASP.NET Azure Web Site for displaying data from an on-premise repository and another Azure Web Site to host a RESTful API to do all the heavy lifting. Joe will also demo an automatic deployment of code to an Azure Web Site on check-in from Visual Studio to Microsoft's cloud-based Team Foundation Services offering.
