## Title: Performance for SMB Developers - 2011
## Abstract:
### Is performance still important today, with powerful systems and storage, especially in small and medium business environments? The popular concept “code reuse” misinterpreted in SQL has catastrophic consequences.  The cost based optimizer, a cornerstone of modern database engines, can lead to seriously bad execution plans. The immense power of modern system is distribute of many processors cores. The database must be designed for scalable parallel execution plans to benefit from modern system architecture. Finally, random IO performance appears to be solved with SSD. Well, now it is time to admit that there are CPU elements of disk IO that are not solved by SSD storage with immense IOPS capability.
