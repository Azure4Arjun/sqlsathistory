## Title: Data Modeling and Prototyping in Power BI Desktop
## Abstract:
### Power BI Desktop is often shown as a self-service reporting and analytics tool, but it can also be used earlier in the development cycle for prototyping and data modeling, doing it quicker and easier than other tools made for this purpose. 

In this session, we will go through multiple examples showing how Power BI Desktop is the perfect tool to quickly model data from multiple data sources (including web sites, databases, cubes, online services, and even flat files), and perform quick actions to cleanse and connect these various sources to each other using M and DAX functions built-in to Power BI Desktop. Once this model has been built, it can be used to create some quick reports to show how this will be used to help get a project approved/funded. Best of all, using Power BI Desktop to do all of this is completely free, no licensing or Power BI login required!
