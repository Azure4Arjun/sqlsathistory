## Title: SQL 2016 : Obtaining High Performance with In-Memory Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Columnstore indexes uses column-based data storage and query processing to achieve up to 10x query performance gains in your data warehouse over traditional row-oriented storage. It also makes you gain up to 10x data compression over the uncompressed data size. Beginning with SQL Server 2016 columnstore indexes enable operational analytics, the ability to run performant real-time analytics on a transactional workload. In this session we'll see how columnstore indexes work and how we can get most benefits from them in practice.
