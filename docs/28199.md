## Title: SQL Server Consolidation - Resistance is Futile
## Abstract:
### The IT world is currently in cost-saving mode - cutbacks are all over the place and then Microsoft pushes out SQL Server price hikes.  

In this session we will discuss how consolidating SQL Server can reduce overall costs and increase efficiency.  We will cover the reasons for consolidation along with the advantages and the disadvantages of consolidating SQL Servers.  We will also take a look at some of the tools that can assist with a consolidation project and some pitfalls that I have experienced on previous consolidation projects.
