# Rules, Rules, and Rules
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#120-Orange-County-2012)
Event Date: 24-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jeremiah Peschka
## Title: Rules, Rules, and Rules
## Abstract:
### Computers are governed by the rules of physics: electrons, drive heads, and disk platters can only move so fast. Understanding how these rules operate and interact leads to insights into application performance. Understanding why something might perform a certain way makes it much easier to understand the tradeoffs of a specific design.

Database systems are built according to those rules: memory is faster than disk which is faster than the network. Database schemas and queries are built within the rules of database systems. You will hit the limitations of these rules. If you know what the rules are and why they are in place, you'll know when it's time to break them... and how to succeed.

## Speaker: Phil Helmer
## Title: Up Your Game With OUTPUT
## Abstract:
### There are some classic database programming tasks that rely on answering the question "What did I just change?" Prior to SQL Server 2005, we had to use functions like SCOPE_IDENTITY() and some extra tricks for handling multiple rows. Some people even had to resort to triggers. Yikes!! This session focuses on the practical use cases for the T-SQL OUTPUT clause. More importantly, you will find out how you can ditch the tricks of the past for a simpler solution that will help keep you sane.

Event Date: 24-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Warren Sifre
## Title: AlwaysOn – Way to get your 9’s?
## Abstract:
### We are always being told 9’s, 9’s  and more 9’s, but when implementation time comes to take action, technology / budget limitations get in the way, especially in the High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) technology space.  Clustering and Mirroring are great and meet many of our needs, but there are some things we have wished for, such as a mirror database that is usable. AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both Mirroring and Multi-Node Multi-Subnet Clustering (True Geo-Clustering Support!!!).  AlwaysOn also allows the replica database to be used in a Read-Only capacity, so we can use it for reporting purposes. (Imagine that!)  Join us in providing a warm welcome to this new functionality with extensive demos.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding SQL Server XML Features 
## Abstract:
### The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server.

## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.

# Understanding Parameter Sniffing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#120-Orange-County-2012)
Event Date: 24-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Understanding Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.
