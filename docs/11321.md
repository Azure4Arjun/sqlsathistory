## Title: Fast-track to BI Analytics with SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 has made it easier to make the move to Business Intelligence and in this session Carlos Bossy will present three new features you can (and should) implement immediately.  The new Analytics functions in T-SQL, Columnstore indexes, and the Tabular model are powerful features that will give your users the ability to analyze data in a faster, more effective manner.  Each of these features was targeted at casual or beginning BI developers and DBAs who more familiar with traditional relational database models.  You will leave this session with a good understanding of the next steps to take to get on the fast-track to BI.
