## Title: The Future Is Here for Containers!
## Abstract:
### Demonstrate how to use docker swarm to quickly spin up many containers and persist the same data set to all of the containers.  This is what every developer wants. Should your container be on premise or the cloud? Does it matter? Demonstrate how to move a container between on premise and the cloud with data.
