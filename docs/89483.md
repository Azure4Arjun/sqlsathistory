## Title: Practical Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### An improvement of cardinality estimation is something we try to find in every next version of SQL Server. Even with all the improvements the SQL Server 2014 Query Processor gained, we still need to deal with Hash and Sort Warnings, extremely high or low Memory grants, or the well-known User Defined Functions performance issues. That’s why we are so existed to find the new wave of adaptive query processing improvements to handle the more intractable cardinality estimation issues that often result in a poor query performance. Join me in this demo rich session to find what’s in Adaptive QP for you and how it affects your queries and workload. You will find answers of questions like is there a reason to migrate my database to SQL Server 2017 or 2019, what it will bring for my workload.
