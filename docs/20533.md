## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: Recovery and Backup for Beginners
## Abstract:
### We all know that backups are important. But are we building a backup strategy that can recover in a manner that meets business needs? All too often, we plan a backup strategy without a recovery strategy.

In this session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will start with understanding the recovery strategy and work toward implementing the right backups to meet that recovery strategy.  He'll also set the record straight around some very common myths around database recovery and backups.
