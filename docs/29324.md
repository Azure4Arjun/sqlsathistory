## Title: Dynamic SSIS:  Configurations, Expression and Vari
## Abstract:
### One of the biggest hurdles  in any organization is migrating from DEV to PROD with minimal issues.  In this session Brad will help get you over the learning curve of making dynamic SSIS packages to make this transition easier.  Topics of discussion will include using all the different types of package configurations, the SSIS expression language and variables.  After diving into each of these topics Brad will talk about best practices as well as the pros, cons and limitations of using each type of configuration.  At the end of this session you will be able to configure your SSIS packages to be as simple to modify and move without even opening a package!
