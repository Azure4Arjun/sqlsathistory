## Title: Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution
## Abstract:
### This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time. (Or don't even know what the Maintenance Solution is!)
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline.

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for jobs created using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.
If you don't know what I just described in that last paragraph, you should come to this session and that will be explained as well!
