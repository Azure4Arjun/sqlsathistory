## Title: 5 Query Plan Culprits That Cause 95% of Headaches
## Abstract:
### Ever open a huge query plan to track down a performance issue and find yourself overwhelmed by the number of objects on the screen? How do you figure out which part of the plan is causing the problem? What should you do about it? The vast majority of query plan troubles boil down to the same basic causes; solving them is simply a matter of knowing where to look. In this session you will learn how to open a plan and drill in to the most likely problem areas. Once there, a simple analysis of five key indicators will help you diagnose your performance problem faster than you thought possible. Say goodbye to guesswork and game playing. This session will teach you how easy it can be to apply a bit of logic to improve performance of your queries.
