## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services is a phenomenal tool to get the ‘good word’ out to management. Working with Reporting Services can be challenging at times (to say the least) and one learns to work with its subtleties and nuances.
In this hands on presentation, we shall be discussing some best practices that one should follow during the project life cycle from development to the production and implementation phases.
We shall be discussing the pros and cons of utilizing shared datasets, the pluses and pitfalls of utilizing embedded reports, report utilization logging, utilization of graphics and the portability of solutions from one server to another.
