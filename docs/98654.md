## Title: Docker  ASP.NET Core
## Abstract:
### Containers are an increasingly popular way for deployment and application management. Regardless whether we have monolith applications or we make applications as a collection of micro-services, containers provide extreme portability and the possibility of running the same applications in different environments (on local machines, servers, cloud...) without any code or configuration changes. Docker is the leading container technology and Microsoft did a lot to enable it to run on Windows and Azure. Where do the ASP.NET Core applications fit into that picture? After the introduction to containers and Docker, we'll go through the basics of working with Docker from ASP.NET Core developer perspective.
