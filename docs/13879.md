## Title: PowerShell - Making the most of SQL Server Commandlets
## Abstract:
### PowerShell is the Windows IT Pro's new best friend however it has not gotten much love from SQL Server in the past.  Still with the newest releases including Preview version 5 we can do some amazing things and there is no reason we can't share the love back to our favorite RDBMS!  Lets automate SQL Server together with PowerShell.
