## Title: Ansible Automation for MSSQL Server
## Abstract:
### Automation is now required. For DevOps, for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), for user self-service, and for overworked staff, automation is the buzzword. Ansible provides that cross-platform functionality with minimal effort. In this session we'll install and configure MSSQL on a Windows host, install and configure a fail-over cluster on RHEL hosts using pacemaker and availability groups, and provision and deploy a new schema to an existing instance all utilizing playbooks. Also, we'll walk through getting started and example use-cases.
