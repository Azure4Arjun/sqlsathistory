## Title: Currying in a Hurry (Functional Programming with F#)
## Abstract:
### Most of us spend our days coding in object oriented (OO) languages like C#, Java or C++. By looking at other programing paradigms we have an opportunity to reason about problems in different ways, and gain a deeper understanding of what's in our OO toolkit. This talk takes an idiomatic approach to functional programming (FP) using F#. At the end of the talk you'll have a better idea of what FP is, know what "currying" is, and have the information you need to get started with F#.
