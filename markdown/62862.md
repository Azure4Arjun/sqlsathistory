## Speaker: Dummea Vincent
## Title: Access, Users, Permissions for Beginners!
## Abstract:
### Who, What, and Why are important when allowing access to anything in SQL server. Who needs the access, why they need it, and what they will be doing with it, are key factors to think about when assigning permissions. Join me in learning about the different levels of permissions allowed in SQL server, from the server level to the database level and more. You will leave with a better idea and plan of how to say “NO” to that one developer that NEEDS sysadmin access.
