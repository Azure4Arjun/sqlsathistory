## Title: Cassandra for SQL Server Professionals
## Abstract:
### Recently, there's been a big shift towards Big Data and event-driven architectures with eventual consistency. Tech leaders in your organizations may even be using words like Hadoop or Spark or ElasticSearch as answers to these Big Data problems. In this session, we'll look at Cassandra, what it is, how it works, and how it compares to SQL Server. We'll walk through use cases and highlight some places where SQL Server is still a better choice.
