## Speaker: Kate  Treadwell
## Title: Data Visualizations: From Zero to Hero
## Abstract:
### I will discuss one of the easiest ways to make our bosses happy: using data to answer their most difficult questions.  Our challenge is to take massive amounts of data and transform it into meaningful visualizations for the business teams that that IT department services. The most difficult problem often lies at the intersection of millions of lines of data and the teamâ€™s ability to sort through pages upon pages of Excel or printed reports.  I will discuss simple methods of transforming that data from Excel, SQL Server, Oracle, and even flat text files into visualizations which answer some of the biggest questions in a matter of seconds; SSRS or BI development experience is not required.
