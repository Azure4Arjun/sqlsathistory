## Title: We Don't Need Roads: A Look Into SQL Server Indexes
## Abstract:
### Have you ever ran a SQL against SQL Server and it was so slow that you wondered if the database was from 1955? You could use a Delorean or you can create indexes in your database.  This session will introduce you to SQL Server indexes.  Indexes are a powerful tool to improve the performance of our queries. We'll discuss how indexes are structured and why they speed up queries, how INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries are affected by indexes and how to identify if an index is necessary. Then, we'll take a look at an Entity Framework application and see how EF reacts to our fresh new indexes. If you want to make bad query performance a thing of the past this session is for you.
