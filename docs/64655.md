## Title: Replacing Institutional Knowledge with Artificial Intelligence so I can Take a Damned Vacation
## Abstract:
### A lot of my job involves leveraging knowledge that only I possess. Anecdotal stuff and volatile-state-of-the-data stuff that gets updated several times a day and is almost entirely in my own head. Taking vacations kind of sucks because that institutional knowledge travels with me, and no one is able to pick up my slack. All of my peers in the organization are in the same predicament.

Recently though, we've been capturing this institutional knowledge in small artificial intelligences. These systems act in an advisory capacity, routinely automating many of the research and state checks that we need to do our jobs.  These systems make us more productive, more collaborative, and enable some luxurious time away from the desk.

In this session, you'll learn how we identified the candidates for "micro-AIs," how easy these systems were to implement using freely available tools, and gain some of our hard-won insight into balancing automated AI and human decision-making.
