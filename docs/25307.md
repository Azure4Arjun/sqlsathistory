## Title: Unit Testing - Solving some Tough Issues
## Abstract:
### Unit Tests are common place in our tools for creating quality code.  However, we still run into several road blocks that often prevent us from writing a thorough suite of tests.  This session will suggest ways of solving 2 specific problems that I have personally experienced when trying to write suites of unit tests.  Specifically, I'll attempt to address:

* how to write test for older code libraries that do not currently have unit tests so that the code can be changed with confidence (a look at the new Fakes framework in VS 2012).
* how to write tests for logic/data access code that uses Entity Framework without hiding the flexiblilty of Entity Framework (note, I actually don't prefer the repository pattern).
