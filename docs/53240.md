## Speaker: Ian Choy
## Title: instant Business Insight with Azure SQL and Power BI
## Abstract:
### Start gaining the benefits of going to the Cloud for your Business Intelligence needs right now!
In this session we will explore how we can start implementing and using both Azure SQL and Power BI together.
The idea is to develop a demo template that audience can take away and start building their own real-world solution.
Heck, we may even implement some cool Azure SQL features like operational analytic if time permits. ;-)
