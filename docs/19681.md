## Title: Cloudbursting - Amazon RDS for SQL Vs SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### We all know about the low startup costs of using cloud based SQL Servers, but what are the (hidden) costs and benefits?

In this session, we will run thought the supported feature sets of each and how they stack up against one another.
Does one perform better than the other? Are they better for different work loads?

If the demo gods are with us, will can see they both in action and you can see for yourself!
