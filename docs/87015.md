## Title: Query Tuning Internals for the Advanced SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### Skilled SQL developers know that the SQL Server Query Optimizer uses a multi-step process to produce execution plans. But what about deeper components like the parser, the binder, the algebrizer, as well as the optimizer itself? This session will teach you advanced techniques for query tuning as well as surprising behaviors of the query optimization process that can have a dramatic impact on performance, with special attention paid to the transformations applied by the algebrizer, including associative, commutative, and transitive transforms. We will examine a variety of everyday queries whose performance can be greatly improved by applying a deeper understanding of these internal behaviors. Lots of examples and demos!
