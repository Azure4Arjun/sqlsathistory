## Title: Data Engineering Brick-by-Brick: An Introduction To Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### Do you want to be a Data Engineer in the next step on your career path?  Maybe you're just getting started in the rapidly-growing Data Science and Analytics space?  Or perhaps you're already doing on-premises analytics and want to take things to the cloud?  Then come to this introductory session and see what Azure Databricks can do for you!

Azure Databricks provides a cloud-based Apache Spark environment that can be scaled up and out to tackle your big data analytics needs.  We'll look at how to set up your first Azure Databricks cluster, how to use shared notebooks in a collaborative environment, and how to leverage the integrated Azure Machine Learning capabilities.  We'll also discuss where Azure Databricks fits in the modern cloud data warehouse.
