## Title: Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
## Abstract:
### Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours.
