## Title: SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) = Awesome
## Abstract:
### Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is awesome! Here are a few reasons why.

- Create and organize database objects more easily with the Database project template.
- Write SQL code faster with IntelliSense.
- Checks for errors in real-time to identify mistakes quickly. 
- Makes refactoring database objects seem like magic.
- Includes powerful tools for comparing database schemas and data.
- Integrates with source control systems including GIT.
- Helps make team development easier and safer.
- Enables continuous integration and deployment for modern end-to-end application lifecycle (ALM) practices.

Best of all… It’s free! Also, it works with all versions of Visual Studio – including the free community edition.
In this presentation, I will show you how to get started with SSDT, get some quick wins, and touch on some of the advanced features. By the end of the presentation, I hope to make you as excited about SSDT as I am.
