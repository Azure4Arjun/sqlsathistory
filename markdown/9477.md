## Title: Microsoft's Big Play for Big Data
## Abstract:
### Big Data entails collecting and analyzing large volumes of data obtained from Web, social media, scientific and other pools of fast-growing event-driven data. Recently, Microsoft announced its Windows Server and Windows Azure implementations of Hadoop, the open source distributed processing engine widely used in Big Data implementations. And the plot thickens, as Microsoft also fits SQL Server business intelligence (BI) tools on top of Hadoop, to make the analysis part of Big Data work with familiar and accessible Microsoft technologies.

Come to this session to get an overview of Big Data, Hadoop and its integration with te Microsoft BI stack. See how your skills can be applied to this rapidly growing part of the industry.
