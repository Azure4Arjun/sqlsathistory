## Title: Technologies to Watch: A Gaze into Greg's Crystal Ball
## Abstract:
### Last year, Greg delivered a session on technologies that fascinate a technologist as the keynote for SQL Saturday Auckland. People were raving about it afterwards and wanted to see a longer version of it. This is a longer and updated version of that keynote. Greg dives into technologies that fascinate him, that he thinks will fascinate you, and that he thinks will fundamentally alter the world. He looks into how they are likely to change work as we know it today. Come and be intrigued and inspired.
