# Achieve More in Less Time by Using the New SQL PowerShell
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-560)
Event Date: 17-09-2016 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Aaron Nelson
## Title: Achieve More in Less Time by Using the New SQL PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it, using SQLPS prior to SQL Server 2016 was like installing training wheels on a Ducati.   Then, some community feedback was incorporated before SQL 2016 shipped and presto, SQLPS is actually useful all of a sudden.

There is a faster way to manage and even SQL Servers using PowerShell.  I will show you what the new features in SQLPS and why you will probably find it useful, even if you aren't a "DBA".

## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
## Abstract:
### Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

Event Date: 17-09-2016 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: BI  DW
## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: Biml and SSIS Frameworks
## Abstract:
### You’ve probably heard that it’s a data integration best practice to build small, unit-of-work SSIS packages. You’ve heard that with Biml you can create a lot of SSIS packages in very little time. You follow this advice and end up with dozens of SSIS packages. Now what? A metadata-driven SSIS Execution Framework will simplify the execution of several SSIS packages down to a simple, one-line stored procedure call. But then, how does one manage all the metadata required to populate the SSIS Execution Framework? Biml to the rescue!

## Speaker: Geoff Hiten
## Title: What’s your Imperative doing in my Declarative?
## Abstract:
### T-SQL is one of a minority of computer languages where you describe the results rather than code an algorithm.  Unfortunately, many people use habits and constructions learned in imperative languages such as C# or Java when writing T-SQL Code.  In this all-demo session we will explore several such commonly used constructions that are detrimental to SQL Server performance and scalability.

## Speaker: Bill Anton
## Title: 20 Minute Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### Are you familiar w/ SSAS Multidimensional and curious about Tabular? Having trouble deciding between cubes and tabular models? Then this is your session!

Analysis Services Tabular was introduced back in 2012, and yet it has only just started to emerge from the Proof-Of-Concept phase to a legitimate production alternative in most IT departments. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models provide considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. And with major advancements in 2016, Tabular has never been a more appealing solution. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a Tabular model.

## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: IO Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but now has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of t his can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.

## Abstract:
### Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Service Broker - Put Me In Coach
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to Service Broker basics and how you can use it to for an alternative to ETL, batch processing and other asynchronous operations. Service Broker allows you to process your data asynchronously in a single instance. It makes for  a near real time ETL process. 

We will start off with the basic components of Service Broker. Then use what we have learned to  configure it to process some real life data using American Football Plays on a single database deployment. In addition, we will then use Service Broker as a replication alternative to show the ETL capabilities using databases on two separate instances.

At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to use Service Broker for batch processing, ETL or even an alternative to replication.

## Speaker: Jonathan Buller
## Title: Tips and Tricks for the SSIS Catalog
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of the SSIS Catalog in SQL Server 2012, we can now manage our SSIS package execution and monitor performance and logs in a much easier manner than executing packages from the file system.  In this session, we'll walk through setting permissions for SSIS read-only access, executing packages from T-SQL or stored procedures, viewing the logs generated during a package execution, writing custom messages to the logs, and many other tips to make your use of the catalog easier!

# APPLY Yourself

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Title: Enterprise Machine Learning with R and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### R is a pure data science and statistics scripting language. It is considered the best fit for Machine Learning. With more than 5000 packages all machine learning algorithms are covered and improving. R packages help you prepare the data, e.g.: packages for cross validation with N folds, build machine learning models, validation, create plots and to generate predictions. SQL Server 2016 and R Server are a perfect match for building enterprise grade solutions that support deployments for real time predictions and continuous model updates. Join this session for an overview based on sample cases about how to build enterprise grade machine learning solutions with SQL Server and R.
