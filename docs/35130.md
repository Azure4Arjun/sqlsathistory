## Title: Gaining SQL Server Insight with DMV's
## Abstract:
### This session will explore SQL Server 2005 DMV's.  During this session will explore what DMV's are, and how they can be used to obtain information that SQL Server has collected about your SQL Server environment.  Thing we will explore is how to identify indexes that have not been used, or indexes that SQL Server has identified that are missing.  Other thing we will explore is how to use DMV's to identify your most expensive queries by CPU, I/O and elpased time.
