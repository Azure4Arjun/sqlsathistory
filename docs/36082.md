## Title: The Data Loading Performance Presentation
## Abstract:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be a challenging task. When doing it, there are quite a few factors that can help or hurt you.

For that, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it.

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and talk about the ways you can optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

Among other topics, we will talk about the #1 enemy of high performance data loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Load, indexing techniques, properly leveraging parallelism and partitioning, SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability, and more.
