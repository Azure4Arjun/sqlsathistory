## Title: Enterprise Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### Tabular models in SQL Server 2012 give us a powerful analytic engine that is faster and easier to implement than traditional multi-dimensional cubes using Analysis Services. In this session, you'll see how to develop analytic models using your existing data sources and learn best practices for preparing data so that it can be effectively used as a Tabular database. In addition to creating the model, you'll see how to quickly add measures, hierarchies, and calculated columns to provide a rich user experience and how the model works with Excel, SSRS and other reporting tools.
