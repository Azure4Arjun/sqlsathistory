## Title: Breaking Bad Habits: Solutions for Common Query Antipatterns
## Abstract:
### Your query returns the correct results, but even with supporting indexes it seems slow. Can it go any faster? In this session, we focus on T-SQL query antipatterns – commonly used techniques that are unintentionally counter-productive. Through an interactive story of user requests, we identify several antipatterns, examine what makes them troublesome, and show alternative methods to improve performance.
