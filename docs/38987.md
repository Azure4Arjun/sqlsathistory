## Title: What about the Data Dude? SSDT Database Projects
## Abstract:
### For years the database has been treated as a second class citizen when it comes to source, change, and version control, often thought of as a dumb data store.  Microsoft first addressed this with Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition, aka "Data Dude".  After the release of Visual Studio 2012, Microsoft pulled the database project out of Visual Studio and created SQL Server Data Tools as separate, free to SQL Server users, install on top of the Visual Studio shell.  The database project was updates making managing databases as code much easier and making the database a first class citizen in the code world.  We will cover how to create a database project, connect it to source control, and deploy to our database servers.
