## Title: Tasting the Flavors of Analysis Services 2012
## Abstract:
### The Unified Dimensional Modeling (UDM) concept was introduced in Analysis Services 2005 as the semantic layer to enable the OLAP cube development from multiple sources using an abstract layer. Now, Analysis Services 2012 introduces the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) concept as an evolution to UDM, offering two new "flavors": the Multidimensional Mode and the Tabular Mode. The BISM represents the heart of Microsoft Business Intelligence strategy for now and the upcoming years. This session will explain and clarify the basic concepts of Analysis Services 2012 and PowerPivot 2.0 and discuss different scenarios  that will allow BI architects / developers to take better decisions when developing OLAP solutions with SSAS.
