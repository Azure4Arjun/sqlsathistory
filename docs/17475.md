## Title: 10 tips everyone should know about powershell
## Abstract:
### If you are not using powershell once in a while, then you really need to attend this session. We still find many people compiling small Console apps, or building expensive configuration UIs, but what we need in operations is a good script. Let’s learn why scripts are safer, easier to maintain and debug in production. Because the language and the runtime platform are also huge in terms of programming styles and wrappers (COM, WMI, Registry, XMLDOM, DOS, DotNet), there are always many ways to do it. In this session we will dig into some of the tips that can make our scripts much easier to use, learn and maintain.
