## Title: How to get your Dream Job: Resume  job hunting tips
## Abstract:
### What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be a DBA, a teacher, a blogger, and a world-traveler. I'm living my dream. 

In this session, we'll talk about how I got where I am, and how you can get to where you want to be. In addition to sharing my journey, I'll give some helpful tricks to getting your next job. You'll learn how to write a resume that gets you noticed, how to navigate interviews, and learn how to decide if a potential job and employer is right for you. 

Bring your own resume to this session, and I'll provide you some personal (and private) feedback on what I would do to help improve your resume so you can land your Dream Job.
