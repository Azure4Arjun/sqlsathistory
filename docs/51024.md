## Title: Use SVG to Bring the Web to Life
## Abstract:
### SVG is more than just an image format. It’s a solution that solves many problems with today’s rapidly growing web, especially in responsive design. SVG also contains many features to enhance the user's experience: accessibility, resolution independence, and interactivity. We'll see why we should use SVG, how to style SVG using CSS, how to animate SVG to bring the web to life, and much more.
