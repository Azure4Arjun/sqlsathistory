## Title: Partitioning Performance in the Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### By simply applying partitioning to large tables, a database developer can possibly yield immediate benefits in query and ETL performance. This presentation will discuss methods that will allow BI developers to more fully leverage table partitioning in order to improve ETL and query performance in the data warehouse lifecycle. The benefits of partitioning‘s participation in an implementation of SQL Server 2012’s new columnar index storage will also be discussed.
