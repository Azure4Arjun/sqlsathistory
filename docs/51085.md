## Title: Building a Simple SQL Server Partitioning Solution
## Abstract:
### In this session we will build a partitioning architecture in SQL Server for high volume insert scenarios. We’ll begin with a short discussion of our problem scenario and motivation to partition. Then, we’ll create the partitioned tables and related supporting database objects. Next, we’ll create some data access code to perform crud operations. We’ll finish by creating data retention artifacts to complete a simple, production ready partitioning solution.
