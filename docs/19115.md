## Speaker: Lenni Lobel
## Title: Native File Streaming with SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### In this dynamic session, Lenni will teach you the ins-and-outs of unstructured data storage and native file streaming in SQL Server 2012. Learn all about FILESTREAM, an innovative feature introduced in SQL Server 2008 that integrates the relational engine with the NTFS file system. FILESTREAM revolutionized BLOB storage in the database, and now FileTable, new in SQL Server 2012, builds on FILESTREAM to deliver a logical file system—implemented as a FILESTREAM-enabled table in your database—on top of your BLOBs. Lenni will demonstrate how to program FILESTREAM using T-SQL and, for maximum performance, using the OpenSqlFileStream API in C#.
