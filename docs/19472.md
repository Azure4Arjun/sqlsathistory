## Speaker: Marco Russo
## Title: DAX from the field: Real World Case Studies
## Abstract:
### DAX is still relatively new for many BI practitioners, but it has being used for more than 4 years now, also in large installations that push the xVelocity in memory engine to its limit. In this session, we will share some of the lessons learned from the field, where real customers have problems harder to solve than Adventure Works scenarios. How do you make a database fit in memory, if it does not fit? How do you handle billions of rows with complex calculation? Can you perform reporting in any time zone, with time intelligence, in an efficient way? What tools do you use to benchmark and choose the right hardware? How do you scale up performance on small and large databases? What are the common mistakes in DAX formulas that might cause performance bottlenecks? These are just a few examples of the problems that you will see in this session. You will learn the solutions found and how far you can push the limits of the system.
