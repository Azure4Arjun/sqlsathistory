## Title: Exploring the SSIS API
## Abstract:
### The SQL Server BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) is a great tool for graphically designing SSIS packages, but there are times when having the flexibility of just working in code is preferable to the GUI interface.  In this session, we'll explore the SSIS API and discuss how it can be used to create and manipulate SSIS packages in .NET code.  We'll have a number of practical examples throughout the discussion.
