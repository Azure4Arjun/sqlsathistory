## Title: The Smart Way to Troubleshoot SQL Server Always On Cluster and Av
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances (FCI) and Availability Groups (AG) depend a lot on Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). But when mission-critical databases go offline, bringing them back online could be a nerve-wracking experience.

This session will look at understanding how the underlying WSFC platform works to help us maintain availability of our databases. This is for DBAs and systems administrators who are responsible for administering SQL Server FCIs and AGs but are not so comfortable with figuring out why the databases went offline and what they can do about it. Weâ€™ll walk thru the troubleshooting process that I follow to quickly identify and resolve SQL Server FCI and AG availability issues.
