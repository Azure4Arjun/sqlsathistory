## Title: How do you create nice/horrible packages?
## Abstract:
### SSIS Development Best Practices:
I have seen my share of unreadable and unmaintainable SSIS packages. Last year I showed how to create faster packages, this time I want to show you how to create better packages with a list of do's and don'ts when creating packages and working in a project team. And how do you use/setup a product like TFS when working with SSIS?
