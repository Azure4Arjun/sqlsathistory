## Title: Making the Most of Virtual Chapters and Other Free Training
## Abstract:
### Are you a member of SQL PASS Virtual Chapters? Why not?  Do you regularly attend VC training sessions or other free webinars provided by almost endless sources  vendors? It costs you nothing but makes you more employable.  That's a total win in my book!
We'll teach attendees about Virtual Chapters, how to pick which one works for them,  registering for and attending the sessions that would help them most on their career path.  We'll also cover other free training provided by PASS, Pragmatic Works, SQL Sentry, etc.
