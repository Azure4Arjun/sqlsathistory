## Title: Is AlwaysOn really as powerful? Tips and Tricks from the field
## Abstract:
### CIOs and VPs everywhere are asking me, how do we achieve HA with SQL Server? Having architected and implemented over 100 architectures, see how to architect, design, setup, deploy, tons of gotchas and best practices from real production deployments
With the introduction of AlwaysOn and the deprecation of Database Mirroring, Windows Clustering Services is now more critical than ever. If you have moved away from clustering or implemented database mirroring as an alternative to clustering and found it lacking AlwaysOn is the way forward for you. This talk will demonstrate a complete end-to-end solution using Windows Server Failover Clustering, AlwaysOn, SQL Server 2012 Enterprise edition, and Active Directory.
