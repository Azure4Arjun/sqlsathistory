## Speaker: Chris Shaw
## Title: Tips for SQL Server Performance and Resiliency
## Abstract:
### After working 20 years in the industry on hundreds of SQL Servers clear patterns emerge. These observations of patterns and best practices directly relate to the health of the server.#160; During this session we will review the patterns of healthy SQL Servers and identify unhealthy behavior that clearly shows servers that are at risk.#160;
We will review shared patterns, configuration and practices.#160;#160; Which of these repeating patterns represent healthy Servers and which of these patterns are#160; shared with servers that are having issues daily.#160;
These patterns are so clear in fact that I many SQL Servers will benefit from the application of at least one if not more of the tips we will cover.#160; At the end of this session attendees will have the tools to identify and correct common issues that impact SQL Servers Performance and Resiliency.

## Speaker: Paul Nielsen
## Title: Developing Production Quality SQL Code
## Abstract:
### Most of the training we receive as SQL Server professionals has code developed for the purpose of demoing or providing training for a specific feature. I’ve developed my share of demo code and it serves it purpose. This session is different. I’ll quickly demo my company’s application (so you can get a sense of what it does), and then walk through many key portions of the actual T-SQL code showing you how the techniques I’ve used to make it production worthy with a focus on robustness, security, and performance. note: this session includes a LOT of dynamic SQL.

# Hadoop and SQL Together: Modern Data Warehouse Design Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#415-Colorado-Springs-2015)
Event Date: 06-06-2015 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: NoSQL
## Speaker: Josh Fennessy
## Title: Hadoop and SQL Together: Modern Data Warehouse Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### No question about it, Hadoop is here and enterprises large and small are starting to embrace it. The adoption rate of Hadoop is making some EDW professionals anxious about this technology replacing their tried and true relational data warehouse.  This is a worry that need not be had.

In this session, we'll go through several design patterns that show how Hadoop can augment an existing relational data warehoue, and show WHY we need both technologies to cover the broad spectrum of reporting an analytics.

This session is largely conceptual, although we will cover a few code examples to show how some of the Hadoop technologies work in conjunction with SQL Server as a data warehousing platform.

# Getting Started with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#415-Colorado-Springs-2015)
Event Date: 06-06-2015 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Andy Galbraith
## Title: Getting Started with Extended Events
## Abstract:
### Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: SQL Server Backups and Restores A to Z
## Abstract:
### Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

# Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#415-Colorado-Springs-2015)
Event Date: 06-06-2015 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Marc Beacom
## Title: Getting started with Dimensional Modeling
## Abstract:
### Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.

## Title: An Unexpected Journey: SQL Server 2000 to 2014
## Abstract:
### As a DBA yourself, I’m sure you’ve encountered instances where the SQL Server has been running fine, there’ve been no changes for ages, everything is stable, there’s no exposure to the outside world, and the last time anyone updated or applied a patch to the server was in February 2004… …and then the world intruded, and all of a sudden you’ve been given a directive to “bring that system up to date!” Now what? You’re faced with upgrading not only the SQL Server, but the Windows server as well (and a bunch of other applications), because Microsoft has announced that ALL support for Windows Server 2003 will be going away (far away!) this summer! And some clever person upstairs decided that it would be A GOOD THING to have this SQL Server exposed to the outside…and has commissioned the web dev team to build a whole suite of apps that WILL MAKE THE COMPANY MILLIONS! Where to start…

# The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#415-Colorado-Springs-2015)
Event Date: 06-06-2015 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Michael Sexton
## Title: The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise
## Abstract:
### Every database professional knows the database design ideal and we have all seen that ideal on numerous occasions -  databases in perfect third normal form;  constraints and relational integrity rigorously enforced; elegant error handling in every SQL statement;  data so clean you can eat off it.

Unfortunately we’ve only seen this ideal in textbooks and sample databases designed by vendors.  

The databases we see in the real world are… less than ideal shall we say.  Of course, we use other phrases for what we see but human resources frowns on such terms and this is, after all, a family friendly presentation.  
Database professionals in Greece circa 600 BCE may have access to the Alpheus and Peneus rivers to cleanse their particular stables but we modern folks need to rely on the tools on our own computers such as SQL and SSIS.  Mike will review various techniques and tools for data cleansing that will help you wash away the muck to get to the data gold standard.

# Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#415-Colorado-Springs-2015)
Event Date: 06-06-2015 - Session time: 15:40:00 - Track: Architecture
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.

## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: An Introduction to Hadoop Development
## Abstract:
### Big Data has moved beyond the hype and entered the mainstream as a tool for managing large and unstructured data sets, giving data architects more options for managing data. The Hadoop ecosystem has become the tool of choice and Microsoft has entered this arena with HDInsight in the cloud. For DBAs this means having a place to store data that can be accessed using a highly parallel framework. In this session you’ll see how to use the numerous tools available to store data in Hadoop, process it, manage it, and retrieve it. We’ll explore Sqoop and how its many options can be configured to import data by taking advantage of Hadoop’s massive parallelism. We will develop and run Map\Reduce code, with an emphasis on understanding what belongs in a mapper function versus what belongs in a reducer function, while demonstrating Hadoop Streaming with languages such as R and C#.  Finally, Hive will be shown to exhibit the use of a high-level query language in Hadoop for those who prefer SQL.

## Speaker: Brian Flynn
## Title: IO, IO, Why's my SQL Slow?
## Abstract:
### Disk I/O can be a significant performance bottleneck for SQL Server. And when physical I/O is the suspected culprit, the first thought is to purchase more storage. But expensive hardware upgrades don’t necessarily ensure a faster database. So how do you determine how much I/O is contributing to poor performance? How can you assess the performance of a specific workload on different types of storage? And how do you decide which infrastructure is best for a specific storage solution?  

This presentation will cover :
The difference between latency, throughput, IOPS, and how they relate.
Performance characteristics of several storage solutions.
Techniques for analyzing storage subsystem performance.
How database design and infrastructure interact and impact performance and scalability.

## Speaker: Kat Long
## Title: SQL Server Maintenance Plans
## Abstract:
### Most DBA’s know you need to be doing some form of maintenance on your databases: Backups, index rebuilding\reorganization, update statistics, integrity checks, and system cleanup.  SQL Server offers some basic tasks to complete this needed maintenance. The session will cover setting up a maintenance plan including the tasks, schedules, and logging. From there, we will dive deeper into the basic task, find out what is going on behind the scene, and discuss when it is OK to use them and when you should create your own.  At the end of the session you will know how to create a maintenance plan, how to log results and keep a history of success or failures, when you should use what SQL Server has provided and when you should create your own plan.
