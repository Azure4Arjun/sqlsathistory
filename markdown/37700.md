## Title: What to expect from QA
## Abstract:
### This is a Beginner/Intermediate level discussion.  I will discuss some of the basics about what QA is capable of.  This will all be based around the waterfall methodology.  I will demonstrate test cases, bug tracking, and discuss building a test matrix and its effectiveness with multiple checkpoints throughout a given testing session.
