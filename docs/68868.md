## Title: Azure Data Lake: What, Why, and How
## Abstract:
### We will explore the capabilities of Azure Data Lake, and use cases for implementation. Options for integration of the data lake with SQL Server, Azure SQL DW, Azure SQL DB, and Azure Blob Storage will be discussed, as well as the role of U-SQL and PolyBase in a multi-platform system. You will leave this session with suggestions for getting started with organizing, populating, and securing Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Data Lake Analytics.
