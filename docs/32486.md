## Title: Asynchronous T-SQL processing
## Abstract:
### Many times an application needs to launch into execution a T-SQL script, but it is not interested in waiting until the script is finished. Traditionally such a task would be accomplished using a SQL Agent job. I will present an approach that leverages SQL Service Broker Activation mechanism and go over the advantages and disadvantages of this alternative.
