## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Tune Like a Guru!
## Abstract:
### In this Pre-Con event we will cover a wide array of topics that form the backbone of my SQL Server performance analysis and tuning work.  As a long-time relational engine consultant I have repeatedly found that the majority of clients I work with get amazing improvements by simply putting to use a fairly small collection of knowledge and tools.  We will cover many topics, including:
  
- Server, virtualization and database configuration
- Optimization processes
- Statistics
- Indexing
- Understanding query plans
- Improving design
- Improving code
- Profiler use and analysis
- Temp object usage
- Waits and IO stall analysis
- ORM Badness
 
We will look at all of these things and more from a variety of angles, while also covering many of the tips, tricks, tools, etc. I have collected in my almost 45,000 man hours of working with SQL Server.  I promise you will come away with lots of immediately-applicable information which you can take back to work and Tune Like A Guru!
