## Title: Power BI Implementation: A Guide to the Other 90%
## Abstract:
### When learning about Power BI, the part you learn first is all the powerful visuals. But like an iceberg, that's just the 10% everyone sees. If you are asking yourself "what's next?", this training will teach your the other 90%.

In the first half of the day, we will focus on data manipulation. Often times, the hardest part of making a report is shaping the data. We will cover applied database theory, data cleansing with PowerQuery and data modelling with DAX. We'll show you what each tool is good at and when to use it. We'll also cover some internals so you understand at a deeper level how these tools really work.

The second half of the day is all about deployment and administration. Do you have a data governance plan in place? We'll show how to access your on-premises data with data gateways. We'll cover options for securing and protecting your data, including row-level security and auditing. Finally, we'll go over the ways you can share and distribute these reports.
