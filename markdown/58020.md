## Title: On the Doorsteps - Women in Technology
## Abstract:
### Women make up over half of the workforce, and yet there are still discrepancies in pay and in the number of women in certain industries. Technology is one of the industries where women are drastically underrepresented. What factors in industry and society have contributed to these outcomes?

In this session, we will discuss the effects of trends in industry such as college graduation of women in technology fields, and women currently in tech or in positions of leadership. And, even important to us, how the contributions of women in PASS affect our community. This will be an open discussion with input from the audience encouraged.
