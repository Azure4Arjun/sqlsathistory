## Speaker: John Martin
## Title: Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.

# Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#592---Raleigh-2017)
Event Date: 11-03-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: Query Store – What is it all about?
## Abstract:
### SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.

# Module Signing or: How I Learned to Stop Using EXECUTE AS and Love Certificates
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#592---Raleigh-2017)
Event Date: 11-03-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Solomon Rutzky
## Title: Module Signing or: How I Learned to Stop Using EXECUTE AS and Love Certificates
## Abstract:
### Often enough we need to grant higher-level than ideal permissions to a Login or Role that are necessary to perform a task. For example, someone needs to start a SQL Agent job without being able to edit any jobs. Or, a task needs data from one of the DMVs that requires the "VIEW SERVER STATE" permission, but you don't want the user to see everything that is made available by that permission. When ownership-chaining doesn't work, the common solution is to use EXECUTE AS (i.e. Impersonation). Sometimes this works, but cross-DB tasks often require enabling cross-DB ownership chaining and/or TRUSTWORTHY, which are security risks.

Module Signing is more flexible and more secure, but requires a Certificate or Asymmetric Key. Those can be confusing to work with, and the security mechanism isn't intuitive.

Come learn how to have more secure, granular control over permissions that covers cross-DB tasks and Dynamic SQL. See what signing can do, understand how certificates work, and rejoice.

## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: The Art and Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server
## Abstract:
### When asked to design a critical database solution, too many people pick an HA feature assuming it will be the right fit for the application. This can result in a costly and disappointing design that does not meet your availability goals. 
This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way, you’ll hear some best practices, tips, and real world advice for choosing between features like Availability Groups and clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. You will also get a glimpse of how some of the largest mission critical systems running on the Microsoft platform are created using a distributed model where redundancy replaces failover.
While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will improve how you approach designing systems.
