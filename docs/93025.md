## Title: Building a Machine Learning Regression Model with Zero Code in PowerBI
## Abstract:
### PowerBI recently added support for AutoML (Supervised Automated machine Learning). This session demonstrates the new ML capabilities with an end to end example using Power BI Dataflows. In this session, we will use AutoML to create and apply a regression model. Regression is a machine learning technique used for understanding the relationship between input and output variables. Regression  techniques provide additional insight into data, making it easier to see relationships between dependent and independent variables.
