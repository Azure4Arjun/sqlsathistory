## Title: Power up SSRS 2017 with Power BI Report Server
## Abstract:
### Power BI Report Server is a superset of SSRS 2017 that includes on-premise hosting of Power BI reports. 

PBIRS provides us a modern solution for enterprise reporting and mobile business intelligence where you can apply your own terms of governance and distribute reports behind your organizations firewall.
 
In this session you will learn how to develop and publish Power BI reports (.PBIX) in Power BI Report Server, including custom visuals.

I will also show how you can develop and host Mobile reports, KPI and Paginated reports. You can view these on your browser or on any device (iOS, Android and Windows). I will round off this session with custom branding, add sharable comments, and (yes!!) the newest feature addition of Excel Workbooks.
