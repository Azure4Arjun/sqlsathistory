## Title: Azure Data Factory V2: SSIS in the Cloud or not?
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory V2 is an Azure a Platform-as-a-Service with many SSIS-like features, but is it good enough to replace SSIS? In this session we will review some of the ETL and ELT features in Azure Data Factory, discuss design patterns for ADF pipelines, review useful activities in ADF and see how closely it compares to SSIS.
