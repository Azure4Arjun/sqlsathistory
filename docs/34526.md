## Title: Introduction to Database Mirroring
## Abstract:
### Database mirroring was introduced as a new database-scoped high-availability option in SQL Server 2005 and has quickly become a popular alternative to database clustering and log shipping. We will look at what makes database mirroring a particularly inviting option, the basics behind the technology and implementation as well as discuss first-hand the caveats we discovered during the implementation of database mirroring at the University of Iowa.
