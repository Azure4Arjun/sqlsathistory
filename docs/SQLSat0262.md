## Speaker: Ayad Shammout
## Title: Building BI Semantic Model Tabular in 60 minutes
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2012 introduces the new Analysis Services Tabular Mode. BI Semantic Model (BISM) Tabular is in-memory database in Analysis Services using state-of-the-art compression algorithms. BI Semantic Models can be developed in either Visual Studio or in Excel using the SQL Server 2012 PowerPivot add-in. In this session, I will show you how to build a complete solution in Tabular and creating one from the ground up, deploy a rich semantic model and discover a simpler method for analyzing business data. You also learn the basics of DAX language and how to manage role based security and partitioning in a Tabular model. You will be able to create your BISM Tabular models, and gain a solid background to enable you starting your next project.

## Speaker: Bradley Ball
## Title: Trimming Indexes Getting Your Database In Shape
## Abstract:
### Indexes are a wonderful thing.  We should be using them, and we should be maintaining them.  But over time our production databases start to look a little pudgy around the mid-section.  Maybe they are a little bloated with Unused Indexes, maybe they have Duplicate Indexes, and possibly even Reverse Indexes.  The first step to fixing these problems it so see if you have them, and if you do the second is to set about fixing them. You could be costing yourself CPU cycles, I/Op’s, and space and never even know it.

Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Longfellow
## Speaker: Bob Pusateri
## Title: Whatcha Doin'? Passive Security for Hostile Environments
## Abstract:
### Ideal database security settings usually exist in books, but rarely in reality. Is your CIO a member of the sysadmin role because they demanded it? Or maybe some users have rights for purely political reasons? Just because you can't enforce security through typical means doesn't mean you're powerless. Attend this session to learn about the features SQL Server provides that will allow you to keep track of what your users are up to at all times and sleep a little easier. Through various scenarios and demos, see how technologies such as event notifications, auditing, and extended events can help ensure nothing happens on your system without you knowing about it. Even in optimally secured environments these techniques can still come in handy. The best security is often that which cannot be seen.

## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics
## Abstract:
### Partitioning allows us to isolate parts of our table as small chunks called partitions.  In turn, these partitions allow us to do some really cool tricks for manageability and performance.  In this session we'll look at the concepts surrounding partitioning and how we can apply them.  We'll reinforce what we cover with some cool demo's showing some really neat tricks.

# Implementing a HIPAA Compliance Strategy with SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-262)
Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Constitution
## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Implementing a HIPAA Compliance Strategy with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### HIPAA puts a lot of responsibility on our companies and compliance can be hard to maintain. Today medical data is more valuable on the black market than a social security number or a credit card.  As DBAs we're charged with the security of our data and thus act as front line defense.

In this hour long session We'll delve into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what implications it has for us as data professionals. We'll discuss SQL Server best practices that can help protect ourselves, our company, and the people whom we serve. We'll also dive into features in SQL Server that can help in this endeavor.

Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Constitution
## Speaker: Bryan Cafferky
## Title: So you think you know SSIS? What about Scripting? 
## Abstract:
### If you don’t know how to extend the power of SSIS through the Script Task and Script Component, you don’t know SSIS.  Empower your SSIS skills by learning how to add  .Net scripts to your packages using C# or VB.Net code to access the full power of Windows and its object models.  In this presentation Bryan will walk through the basics of SSIS scripting building to more complex examples using real world cases.  Learn how to load any external flat file by taking direct control, how to leverage the power of the SQL Server Object Model (SMO), ActiveX Data Objects (ADO.Net), and use the power of Regular Expressions for advanced string parsing.  You will leave with the basics you need to start scripting and a number of useful scripts you can add to your packages.

## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: Optimizing Protected Indexes
## Abstract:
### As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.

# Statistics and Query Optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-262)
Event Date: 29-03-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Hawthorne
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics and Query Optimization
## Abstract:
### There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Effective use of temporary tables
## Abstract:
### Every developer eventually comes against business logic that can’t be handled with a single simple or complex query. TSQL provides the developer with several constructs that can store temporary result sets that are passed to the next query in the script.

I will be covering these various TSQL techniques with examples using the [AdventureWorks] database as well as a toy database called AUTOS. The pros and cons of each construct will be examined. Advanced options like enabling trace flag 1118 will be explored.

Coverage:

1 – Derived tables.
2 – Local temporary tables.
3 – Global temporary tables.
4 – Table variables.
5 – Common Table Expressions (CTE).
6 – User databases in [tempdb].
7 – Trace Flag 1118.

## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
## Abstract:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

## Title: T-SQL : Bad Habits  Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. You will also learn about best practices that will help you avoid falling into some of these bad habits. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them - leading to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases – both.

## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Patch Management Strategies for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### We all have to deal with applying some sort of update to Windows, SQL Server, and/or hardware. Keeping things up to date is crucial for supportability, not to mention other things like security, performance, and stability. Since patching often involves downtime, you need to be careful not only what you apply to avoid problems, but also find ways to minimize the impact to the business and end users. This session will cover topics such as how to approach patching including what changes you should and should not consume, features that may help you automate or script patching, and developing your own long term patch management strategy.

## Speaker: Adam Machanic
## Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Clash of the Row Goals
## Abstract:
### The fight for better performance is a battle of wits: your mind, your intelligence, and your honor pitted against the less-than-dependable whims of the Query Optimizer. But alas, the arbitrary rewrites and clunky hints leveraged by most developers to get around optimization deficiencies make things feel less like a proper duel and more like a skirmish at the sandbox. To truly engage your enemy you must comprehend his inner workings, and in the case of the Query Optimizer, that means you must delve into the mysteries of "row goals." These internal metrics are tracked and enforced within Top iterators--and they exhibit a considerable amount of influence over plan shape and flow, both at compile time and as your query runs. Attend this session to learn how to take charge of optimization, expertly mold your query plans, and gain a new set of tools for eliminating bottlenecks in even your most complex problem queries. En garde!

## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: Designing an SSIS Framework 
## Abstract:
### In this “demo-tastic” presentation, SSIS trainer, author, and consultant Andy Leonard explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and centralizes logging. Key takeaways: 1) Developers can migrate packages from Development, through their lifecycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Managers properties. 2) A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution. 3) Demonstration of a centralized logging reporting application.
