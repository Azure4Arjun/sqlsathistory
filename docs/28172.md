## Title: Bus Matrix â€“ The Foundation of your Dimensional DW
## Abstract:
### The Bus Matrix is the cornerstone of a successful Dimensional Data Warehouse strategy. It serves many purposes: from communicating requirements, capabilities, and expectations with the business users down to the prioritization and delegation of tasks across the development team.

Join me in this session and learn what a Bus Matrix is, why it is the single most important document in your Data Warehouse project, and what can go wrong without it. We'll also cover several approaches for creating and maintaining the Bus Matrix document.
