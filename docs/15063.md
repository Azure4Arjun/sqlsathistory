# SQLSaturday #228 - Cambridge 2013
Event Date: 28-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: The Meaning of Life (DBA)
## Speaker: Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Advanced Indexing
## Abstract:
### So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.
