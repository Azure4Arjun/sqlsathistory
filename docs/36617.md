## Title: Sponsor (Artis): Changing the Game – The Restaurant Experience With Data
## Abstract:
### Imagine the ultimate restaurant experience – great food and service, timely food delivery, entertainment and on-demand check payment. Ziosk delivers this idyllic experience through thoughtful technology and improved data and analytics capabilities. Tablet technology allows diners to relay orders directly to the kitchen, play interactive games, and pay at the table, and also substantially increases the likelihood of survey responses and loyalty enrollment. With real-time data collection, analytic and content management capabilities, wait staff, management and corporate can optimize the customer experience. Kevin Mowry (Ziosk), Al Pappa (Ziosk) and Jeff Johnston (Artis Consulting) share how Ziosk is changing the restaurant game with technologies such as the Analytic Platform System, HDInsight, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Data Factory and Power BI.
