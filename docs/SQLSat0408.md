# Managing Security in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#408---Houston-2015)
Event Date: 13-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Managing Security in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In the world of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), everything we do involves moving data from one point to another. However, very often the focus in SSIS package development is on functionality, not security. When building internal data transformation and movement processes, it is easy to forget that these operations broaden our security footprint, and must be actively managed to ensure that ETL doesn’t become the weak link in the security chain.
In this presentation, we’ll discuss the security features in SQL Server Integration Services, while reviewing best practices for securing your ETL infrastructure while providing enough (but not too much) access to those ETL assets. Among the topics we’ll cover:
	Properly securing connection passwords in SSIS
	Using package protection levels
	Restricting access to deployed packages
	Using role-based security for SSIS deployment and execution
	Using execution proxies

# AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#408---Houston-2015)
Event Date: 13-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.

## Title: A DBA's pick of differences between SQL Server and Oracle
## Abstract:
### In this session, I want to talk about 5 major differences between SQL Server and Oracle, namely: 
1. Backup, Restore, Recovery (RMAN vs T-SQL/Powershell) 
2. Schema (Single vs Multi tenants) 
3. Alter Index Rebuild (defragmentation) 
4. AWR, ASH vs DMV/DMF (Performance Trouble-shooting) 
5. Data Guard Mode vs AO Availability Group Mode (synch, asynch).  
I will reference my prior year presentation (SQLSaturday#308) how to automate Backup, Restore, Recover SQL Server, Alter Index for Defragmentation, and monitoring backups and agent jobs by using Powershell/T-SQL.
I will also reference my prior year presentation (HASSUG 11/2012) Trouble-shooting with Active Session History (powershell and T-SQL). 
I will show Oracle 12C in Oracle SQL Developer. Target audiences should have SQL Server DBA working knowledge and basic knowledge in Oracle on these topics.

# Building Bullet-Resistant SSIS Packages

## Speaker: Tim Mitchell
## Title: Building Bullet-Resistant SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### It's 2:30 a.m., and you've just gotten that call no ETL developer wants to get: an SSIS package has failed unexpectedly. Immediately, you start asking yourself: "What could have caused this?", "What do I do to fix the data from this failed execution?", and, most importantly, "Could I design the package in such a way that this doesn't happen again?"

In this demo-packed session, we will examine the design patterns and logistics of building error-resistant SSIS packages. Starting with the control flow, we'll work through various tools and patterns that can be used to prevent, or at least handle appropriately, task-level errors. We'll then move to the data flow, and discuss and demonstrate how to proactively address problem data to prevent unexpected package failures.

## Title: The DBA Career Roadmap
## Abstract:
### Nobody has a step-by-step plan for your career. But, you do need to know the general direction you’re heading in; which roads go that way (and which ones dead end); and what might be worth stopping for along the way. For example, working for a small shop might be a dead end career move, or it could be a fantastic shortcut to somewhere you really want to be. Getting that next certification might be a worthy way to spend your time, or it might be running around in circles. 

Want to find out how to get to the next great place in your career? Get solid advice from the people who have already been there. If you want to be somewhere in five years, start moving today.
