## Title: Azure SQL Hyperscale Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### The Azure SQL Database Hyperscale tier is  SQL architected for the cloud and allows applications that encountered limits of prior tiers  to be unshackled. Will deep dive into the architecture of Hyperscale and discuss  the components of hyperscale and iteraction between each component and  the internals of each component. We will cover  scaling aspects and the new application patterns it enables. Last but not the least best practices during migration as well as new diagnostics introduced in Hyperscale that help in performance troubleshooting and bottleneck identification.
