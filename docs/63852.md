## Title: Supercharging Backups and Restores For Fun and Profit
## Abstract:
### Super-fast queries are an essential part of any business process, but speed will never be more important than during a disaster when you need to restore from backup. Come and see how both backups and restores can be tuned just like a query. In this demo-intensive session, we will discuss the different phases of the backup and restore processes, how to tell how long each of them is taking, and which are the easiest to significantly speed up. You just might be surprised how simple it is to achieve dramatic results - cutting your backup and restore times by 75% or more is absolutely possible using the methods covered here.
