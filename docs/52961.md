## Title: Role Based Security in Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Database has a different security model than on premise SQL Server. Although similar, the differences are important and sometimes subtle. In addition to role based security in Azure SQL Database, Azure itself has a role based security model that is independent from the role based security model of Azure SQL Database. This PowerPoint free presentation is all demos where the different security models are deconstructed and explained.
