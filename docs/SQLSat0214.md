# TFS for SQL/BI Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Dave Fackler
## Title: TFS for SQL/BI Developers
## Abstract:
### If you do any kind of SQL Server or BI development, you eventually have to grapple with the problem of keeping multiple copies of your work.  You either need to maintain stored procedure and DDL scripts or you have copies of SSIS and SSRS reports to keep up with.  In most cases, this problem starts off small as you need to have development versus production copies of your code.  But eventually, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your "source code" as your environment becomes more complex and as you potentially have to start working with a team of other developers.  During this session, we'll talk about Team Foundation Server (TFS) and show you the different ways it can be used to keep up with all the different types of source code you might be responsible for -- from full database designs to complete BI solutions.

# How to Write a DML Trigger
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Write a DML Trigger
## Abstract:
### Triggers are extremely powerful and useful (if somewhat rarely needed) objects that are coded very similar to a common stored procedure. Yet for their similarity, there are some very important differences that need to be understood. In this session, I will walk through what goes into writing a robust DML trigger, starting with a simple version of a trigger, and working through some very useful applications of DML Triggers..

# Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Adv. DBA
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
## Abstract:
### Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

# Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

## Speaker: Kyle Neier
## Title: Become a SQL Block’stroyer
## Abstract:
### In order to implement ACID properties, SQL Server uses locks to control who can have access to what resources. In this session we will discuss how to leverage the different isolation levels within SQL Server to affect locking behavior. Before taking a deep dive into how to detect, mitigate, and possibly eliminate certain types of blocking in the system, we will explore some of the basic lock types and how they interact. Once we have learned how to deal with classic blocks in this fast paced demo filled session, we will explore several real world strategies to mitigate the dreaded deadlock. Be prepared to enter this session as a DBA but leave as a SQL Block’stroyer!

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

# Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Adv. DBA
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

# Introduction to the XML source
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#214-Louisville-2013)
Event Date: 13-07-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Introduction to the XML source
## Abstract:
### XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.
