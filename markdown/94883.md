## Title: Inside SQL Server Containers
## Abstract:
### Containers are the new virtual machines. Containers present a new way to deploy, manage, and run SQL Server never possible before. This session will present an internal view of how Docker containers work and how SQL Server runs in them. Will cover the architecture of containers, how we have built SQL Server to run in containers, and how they work in environments such as Kubernetes. While this is an internal focused session you will walk away with knowledge of practical scenarios where SQL Server in Containers may be the right deployment model for you.
