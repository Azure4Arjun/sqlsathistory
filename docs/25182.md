## Title: Scalable, Large-Volume Data Synchronization in OLTP Systems
## Abstract:
### Synchronizing data from any external source (file, web form, web service, etc.) poses problems as the data volume and/or transaction count increases. While a data warehouse might have a regular window in which to ETL its data, an OLTP system--especially one that serves a 24 / 7 / 365 business--has to deal with issues such as concurrency, disk space, and even memory management on the app server. And the processing still needs to be done ASAP.  Various methods will be discussed to synchronize tens of thousands and up to millions of rows quickly, with very little app-memory used, and all while performing validations and transformations.
