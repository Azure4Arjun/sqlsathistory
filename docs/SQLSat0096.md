# Thwarting Database Defects
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#96---Washington,-DC-2011)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Prof. Dev.
## Speaker: Dennis Lloyd Jr
## Title: Thwarting Database Defects
## Abstract:
### It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them. This presentation introduces tSQLt, a framework for automated database unit testing. You’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain.

# Mining XML Query Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#96---Washington,-DC-2011)
Event Date: 05-11-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Sebastian Meine
## Title: Mining XML Query Plans
## Abstract:
### Execution plans contain a lot of information that can guide you in your performance tuning process. Since SQL 2005 it is possible to retrieve the execution plans stored in the cache using DMVs and DMFs. However, as they are stored in XML format it can be cumbersome and difficult to extract the information you need. In this session, you will learn how the XML query plan is structured and how to use SQL Server’s built-in XQuery language to extract information. Examples include indexes that the optimizer indicates would increase performance if implemented and queries that use table scans or nested loop joins.

## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions
## Abstract:
### Let's go from Cradle to Grave with the one dimension in 99.99999% of cubes, the dreaded Date dimension.  Without this dimension users wouldn't know if it is worth staying open on a holiday or which day of the week the most fresh produce ships or even what their bonus will be.  What should be included in the dimension? Should you use the wizard to generate? In this session, we will explore a generic date dimension load script and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time  dimension.  We will explore performance considerations of attribute hierarchies compared with usability benefits of user hierarchies. Finally, we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make Order Date, Ship Date and Received Date dimensions.

## Title: Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.

## Title: Banish RBAR!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is primarily designed for set-based operations, so code that performs Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) operations is going against the design, rather than working with it. Come to this code filled session, where we will examine several recent additions to SQL Server, and learn how the vast majority of RBAR code can be replaced with efficient, set-based code. Learn how the APPLY operator works; iterate through incoming data just once with the MERGE statement; “slice and dice” your data with the Windowing (ranking) functions; re-write your multi-statement table-valued functions to inline functions to help the optimizer and speed up your queries; learn how to create a grouped delimited list – without loops!
