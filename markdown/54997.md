## Title: Choosing the right technologies for a big data solution
## Abstract:
### Has your company been building data warehouses for years using SQL Server?  And are you now tasked with creating or moving your data warehouse to the cloud and modernizing it to support “Big Data”?  What technologies/tools should use?  That is what this presentation will help you answer.  First we will cover what questions to ask concerning data (type, size, frequency), reporting, performance needs, on-prem vs cloud, staff technology skills, OSS requirements, and cost.  Then we will show you common big data architecture solutions and help you to answer questions such as: What tool do I use to move data to the cloud?  Where do I store the data?  Should I use a data lake?  Do I still need a cube?  What about Hadoop/NoSQL?  Do I need the power of MPP?  Should I build a "logical data warehouse"?  Finally, we’ll show some architectures of real-world customer big data solutions.  Come to this session to get started down the path to making the proper technology choices in moving to the cloud.
