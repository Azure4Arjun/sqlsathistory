## Title: Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012
## Abstract:
### There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.
