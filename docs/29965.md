## Title: Make it fast, make it pretty (SSRS)
## Abstract:
### Designing a fast, elegant report for Reporting Services can be challenging.  In this session, we'll cover design methods you can start using right away to create faster reports with fewer headaches and in less time.  We'll also look at how to deal with potentially frustrating aspects of report appearances like border behavior, multi-column layouts, and unwanted blank pages.
