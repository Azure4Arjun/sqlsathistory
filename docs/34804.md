## Title: SQL Server Monitoring Crash Course
## Abstract:
### No one likes to be alone in the dark. Yet, often this is the case with our SQL Servers which usually suffer from a lack of monitoring.  What's important? Tracing slow queries? Collecting wait stats? Looking at perfmon counters?  This session will show you the key elements to monitor in your database instances, how to track them automatically, and where to go after your foundatation is built.
