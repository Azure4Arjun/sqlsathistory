## Title: Virtualizing SQL Server 2012: Doing IT Right 
## Abstract:
### A database is a very resource intensive by its very nature and one of the most resource intensive applications you will ever virtualize. If best practices are not followed, the database will never perform as needed. This presentation will teach the DBA how to virtualize a business critical application like SQL server 2012. It will be based upon experience learned using VMWare as the virtualization platform. But many of the lessons taught will carry over to any virtualized platform.
