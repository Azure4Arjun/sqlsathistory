## Title: Navigating the Hadoop Stack
## Abstract:
### Hadoop distributions can be a complicated road to navigate. Application names such as Spark, Pig, Hive, Falcon, and Ranger are interesting but give no indication as to what purpose they server or how they can be helpful to your organization. We'll take time in this session to work through the various components (Hortonworks HDP ships with 23 projects) and find which ones fit into your specific needs.
