## Title: What is Claims - A look at RS 2012 with SP 2010
## Abstract:
### People say that Kerberos isn't need with Reporting Services 2012.  That is a half truth.  We will look at what has happened with Reporting Services 2012 from an authentication perspective.  This will look at how Claims Authentication fits into the picture and what Kerberos items need to be addressed as a result.  If you are setting up Reporting Services 2012 with SharePoint 2010, you need to be aware of how this works and how it can affect you.
