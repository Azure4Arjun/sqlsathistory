## Title: Handling database evolution with Liquibase
## Abstract:
### We always keep versions of our code in a source control system, but how about the database? How can we reduce the pain of updating the database model when working on a team, or even knowing when do we need to update it? What can we do if we want to rollback to a previous version of the database?  Liquibase is a pretty awesome library that will help you update, maintain and control your database model, as any other asset in your project.
