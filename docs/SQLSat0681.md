# Designing an SSIS Framework
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#681-Spartanburg-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Andy Leonard
## Title: Designing an SSIS Framework
## Abstract:
### Enterprise data integration changed with the introduction of the SSIS Catalog. Implementing enterprise data integration often requires functionality beyond the rich features provided by the SSIS Catalog. Building on his previous work in the field of Data Integration Life Cycle Management (DILM) and SSIS Frameworks development, a Data Integration Architect with 10 years of SSIS experience explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS Catalog-integrated Framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and parameter configuration.

In this session, you will learn:
- A method for migrating packages from Development, through the data integration life cycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Manager Properties.
- A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution.
- A method for customizing enterprise data integration reporting.

## Speaker: Brian Carrig
## Title: Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.

## Speaker: Rie Irish
## Title: Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology
## Abstract:
### Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.

## Title: Using Powershell to Document SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

## Speaker: Thomas Norman
## Title: Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent
## Abstract:
### The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.

## Title: How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan
## Abstract:
### So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.

# Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#681-Spartanburg-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns
## Abstract:
### There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!

# Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#681-Spartanburg-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Brandon Leach
## Title: Treating Tables Like Legos: Table Partitioning Basics
## Abstract:
### Have your tables and indexes that have grown rather large? Are they taking longer to query? Are your windows for maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, table partitioning may be for you!
With table partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and sliding windows. You'll see how we can make our index and statistics maintenance easier. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and be able to make decisions on how and when to implement.

# Interrogating your data sources with Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#681-Spartanburg-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Shannon Lowder
## Title: Interrogating your data sources with Biml
## Abstract:
### You've started using Biml to make your ETL development easier.   The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources?

Simple!  Attend my session and learn how others are doing it using my open source Interrogator.  This code can take any text-based data and apply a series of tests in order to determine what datatype best fits.  These tests also build on each other to allow you to determine the best fit for a column based on the whole file, or on a collection of files.  No more guessing based on the first 200 rows!

During the session, I'll also give a primer on some basic C# programming techniques that can be used along with the code to apply the Interrogator to your own semi-structured data sources.

# Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#681-Spartanburg-2017)
Event Date: 23-09-2017 - Session time: 15:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jeff Mlakar
## Title: Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints
## Abstract:
### Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.
