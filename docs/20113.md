## Speaker: Mark Stacey
## Title: PowerPivot with NASA data
## Abstract:
### Power Pivot is an amazing tool for mashing up data from a variety of sources ~ in this session, we will combine data from NASA, OpenGOV, and other publicly available sources, as well as from a prebuilt cube, to show the power of user driven analysis, and visualisation in Excel.
Using DAX, you will see how to create time-intelligence driven visualisations, and then dive into the new enhancements for the date table, relationshios, perspectives and KPIs.
As an added bonus, you will see how to pull the model into Visual Studio, decorate it with new attributes, and show the visualisations in other tools such as Performance Point and Crescent (PowerView)
