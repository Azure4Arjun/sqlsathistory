## Title: SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle - Part 2
## Abstract:
### The session can also help database pros who prefer to understand and fix the root cause of a problem rather than simply applying a bandage. The session is based on the book “Pro SQL Server Internals” (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430259620), includes numerous demos, and discusses answers to the following questions:

- How does SQL Server store data and use indexes, and how can you efficiently design and maintain them?
- What is the internal implementation of the various database objects, and when should they be used or not be used?
- How do you troubleshoot and fix concurrency issues and design efficient transaction strategies?
- How does SQL Server execute queries, and how are the most common plan-caching-related issues addressed?
- How do you quickly identify and resolve issues and bottlenecks in systems?
