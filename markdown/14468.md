## Title: Making SSIS 2008 Packages More Dynamic
## Abstract:
### The expression language in SQL Server Integration Services is rich, and there are many locations within a package where the expression language can be used to make packages more dynamic. Within Derived Column transformations, Precedence Constraint evaluation, Script Tasks, Connection Managers, Containers and more, expressions and variables can be used to increase the flexibility of an SSIS package. Remember, “Write once, run many!”
