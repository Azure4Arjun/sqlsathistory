## Title: Understanding Indexes
## Abstract:
### This session will focus on the internals of index and how they are structured at a physical level.  Understanding how indexes are structured can then help understand how they can help improve query performance by reducing lookups, serving as a covering index, etc.  The session will use DBCC Page/Ind to look at how different types of indexes are structured and make some suggestions on the best way to structure tables, keys, and indexes to get the best performance from them.  Will also cover index options that can affect how indexes are structured and how Index Rebuild/Reorg work at the physical level.
