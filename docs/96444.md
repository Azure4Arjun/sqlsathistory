## Title: Data Modeling Trends for 2019 And Beyond1
## Abstract:
### It is so difficult to model data today. The number of products the average company uses to store data has exploded. The database vendors are competing and releasing features at an astounding rate. The cloud vendors have also accelerated the pace of change. In analytics, some people say there is no need for a star schema. In transactional systems, some people say that the EF Codd era is over and we can repeat data as often as we want. One blog writer says one thing, while another contradicts them.    These things are creating a confusing atmosphere for the data modeler.    

It is true that data modeling has changed, but there is no need to throw out great practices that have served us for years and can continue to do so. This session will cover what has changed for data modeling, why it changed, and how to take advantage of those changes. Combine new thinking with classic data architecture and you will create great analytic and transactional systems for your data.
