## Title: High-Performance SSRS: Techniques For Faster Reports
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is an easy-to-use tool for automating reports and creating highly visual dashboards. Although SSRS is easy to learn there are many tips and tricks that can improve your report building experience, not to mention make your reports run blazing fast! 
This rapid-fire session goes over my learnings from the past six years of developing high-performance SSRS reports, including topics like multivalue parameter efficiencies, how to best utilize subreports, and performing SQL CRUD operations with SSRS.
Each rapid-fire topic includes sample data and an SSRS reporting example that users will be able to try out for themselves.
