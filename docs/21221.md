## Title: AlwaysOn - What's new on SQL Server 2016 ?
## Abstract:
### AlwaysOn came to help the SQL Server solutions for mission-critical high availability and disaster recovery. The AlwaysOn "brand", has two components: Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Each solution with different characteristics, but still complementing each other.

SQL Server has some enhancements on those solutions and that's what we are going to focus on this session. We will go from a quick introduction of both features to what we have today, after the release of the latest SQL Server version.
