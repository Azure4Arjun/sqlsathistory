## Title: Intro to Azure Data Studio
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform database tool for data professionals using the Microsoft family of on-premises and cloud data platforms on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Azure Data Studio offers a modern editor experience with Intellisense, code snippets, source control integration, and an integrated terminal. It is engineered with the data platform user in mind, with built in charting of query result sets and customizable dashboards. Built on the Electron framework, Azure Data Studio is highly extensible and offers a large library of community-authored extensions as well as access to many of the extension available for Visual Studio Code.

Release 1.5.1 (March 2019) adds support for PostgreSQL and updated support for SQL Server 2019 (pre-release). It also includes support for SQL Notebooks, bringing the persistent, interactive presentation of Jupyter Notebooks to SQL Server, Postgres, and other supported languages.
