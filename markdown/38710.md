## Title: Build Android and iOS Apps with C# and Xamarin
## Abstract:
### You can build Android apps with Java and iOS apps with ObjectiveC or Swift.  But Xamarin allows developers to use c# and still produce native applications.  This is not a marketing session.  We will discuss (and demonstrate) the very real situation where an organization can take advantage of existing code and existing skills and still reach the mobile audience.
