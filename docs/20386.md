## Title: Scalable SSRS Reports Achieved Through the Powerful Tablix
## Abstract:
### Want to quickly roll out ultra-flexible reports that will wow your end users? Want to learn how to display the data in multiple layouts on the same report? Want to consolidate similar reports while still providing flexibility to your end users? This can all be achieved by leveraging the three controls based on the Tablix template: Table, Matrix, and the List control. In this demo-heavy session, you'll learn how to create a columnar report that grows vertically as well as horizontally. You'll see the magic of having multiple layouts for the same data on the same report. You'll see how to do more useful things with fewer reports, and youâ€™ll come away with a bag full of new tricks to make your reports flexible and scalable works of art.
