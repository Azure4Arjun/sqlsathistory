## Title: Docker for the SQL Server Developer
## Abstract:
### Containerization with Docker is a hot topic these days, and SQL Server’s ability to run in-side Docker containers on both Windows and Mac has revolutionized the way develop-ers work with Microsoft’s venerable database engine. This dynamic session starts with a quick introduction to Docker and how it utilizes OS virtualization in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 to provide isolation across multiple containers running on your machine. Then you’ll see how fast and easy it is to spin up any number of SQL Server in-stances to run in both Windows and Linux containers simultaneously. Get bit by the Docker bug, and you’ll never go through the pain of installing SQL Server on your devel-opment machine ever again!
