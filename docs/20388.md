## Title: How Flash Storage Modernizes Databases
## Abstract:
### For decades the characteristics of spinning hard drives have acted as a tail wagging the dog requiring the processes and behaviors of software, architecture and administrators to bend to its requirements. With the advent of a new technology, flash storage, comes the unleashing of a new round of performance potential as well as a shedding of long encumbering patterns. Modernizing databases is about both vastly boosting performance and also significantly reducing the complexity and effort to maintain them. Come see a deep dive into how ultra-fast and random-optimized storage is modernizing database performance, architecture and maintenance.
