## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Learn Like Your Life Depends On It
## Abstract:
### You have read this far, great!  I already know this session is for you. How do I know? It is exceedingly rare that today’s “9-5” job provides anywhere near what is needed to develop the career you want to have.  For the purposes of this session it does not matter if you are a newly minted, “wet behind the ears” data professional or a grizzled veteran.  What does matter is that you know that you have a career oriented mindset and a desire to grow beyond what you are today.

This session is designed to help with just that. In addition to talking about a learning plan that fits your needs, we will discuss how to execute that plan, including lab environments, as well as resources to help you execute those plans.  If you have reached this point, you simply need to be in this session, see you there.
