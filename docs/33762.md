## Title: Data Warehouse ETL with Integration Services
## Abstract:
### Microsoft designed Integration Services with ETL processing for Data Warehouses in mind, so loading one should be pretty easy. It's not that bad, but there are a few things you should avoid and non-obvious best practices to use to make that ETL faster and more reliable. This session will explain how to accomplish Kimball style ETL using SQL Server Integration Services. We'll review the SCD Wizard and how it works for processing your dimension tables - and what alternatives you have to it. We'll also examine fact table loading using a surrogate key replacement pipeline. Finally, weâ€™ll look at specific and easy performance tweaks, techniques and best practices that apply directly to DW loads.
