## Speaker: Jeremy Marx
## Title: Introduction to BIML and BimlScript
## Abstract:
### You have a lot of data to move and a lot of pieces to manage. Perhaps you're a developer and know that SSIS is the best way to move it, but you naturally dislike GUI-based development or you're just not looking forward to the tedium.

Or perhaps you're a team lead/architect and are looking for an efficient platform that best utilizes the development skills of your team.

Jeremy Marx will introduce BIML, a language you can quickly pick up to develop SSIS solutions with code, and BIMLscript, intelligently mixing in C# to make your BIML practically build itself.

Jeremy will demonstrate how to build a simple, single-table SSIS package using BIML, then extend it to many tables with just a few lines of code, and finally apply a more robust data flow designed for reuse. You'll leave with tools and resources to begin coding SSIS solutions faster and more efficiently.
