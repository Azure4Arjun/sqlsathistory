## Title: An Adventure Works IoT Demo: moving beyond sales data
## Abstract:
### This session will cover a potential IoT use case demonstration. I describe how to simulate IoT data and then utilize that simulated data to tell business use stories. I use the classic Adventure Works SQL database as the launch point that is then enriched with the simulated IoT data.
