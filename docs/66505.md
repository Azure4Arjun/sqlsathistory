## Speaker: Kenneth Wood
## Title: Training:  Have It Your Way (Lunch time Session)
## Abstract:
### Stagnancy in learning and personal growth often leads to frustration and undesired stress.  It is vital to our everyday success that we seek to not only better ourselves through professional and personal development, but it is just as critical to ensure the methods we are using to absorb this content are effectively presented and better suit our learning abilities.  

I believe the question we need to answer, is not what we're learning, but rather how do we best learn?  In this session, we will discuss three popular training methods and how we can customize these options to best fit our needs.

This session will help the attendees better prepare themselves for Learning Development and will motivate the attendees to take action.
