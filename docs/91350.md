## Title: What You Need To Know About Processing Tabular Models
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what's happening under the covers when processing a tabular model? Why is it such a resource intensive process? How can I make it run faster? Am I running into a resource bottleneck?

Processing a tabular model can be a very resource-intensive workload and depending on your specific goals (e.g. speed, availability, etc) it may not always be feasible to process the entire model.

In this session, you'll learn what actually happens and in what order during model processing, the difference between the various processing types, performance considerations and most common resource bottlenecks. We'll also cover the most common processing patterns and the associated trade-offs.
