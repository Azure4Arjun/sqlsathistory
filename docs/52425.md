## Speaker: Erik Svensen
## Title: Can M be the head of SSIS ?
## Abstract:
### In this session I will demonstrate how to use M (Power Query) to Extract, Transform and Load data into your data model.

The M language is not yet available in SSIS, but there are already power shell scripts that can perform the load to your database. I will walk through the steps in a simple ETL process and explain some of the quick wins when using the transformations, lookup, variable and parameter functions that M provides compared to standard SSIS and how to create your own functions. We will finish the session with a demo on how to load data from your tables to your SQL database.
