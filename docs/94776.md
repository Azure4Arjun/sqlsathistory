## Title: Anomaly Detection in Predictive Maintenance for Sql Server
## Abstract:
### The amount of data we collect, store and process is rapidly growing and goes hand in hand with growing amount of work related to managing it. Automation is a key if we want to stay in control and AIOps represents its next major level with potential to revolutionise IT operations. This session explains what predictive maintenance is, provides common use cases and gives practical examples that help to avoid costly Sql Server disruptions and eliminate firefighting. Presented real-world examples address limitations of Query Store and automate the identification and resolution of common performance issues.
