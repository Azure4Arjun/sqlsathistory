## Title: Exposing SQL data with SharePoint
## Abstract:
### You've got your data, but accessing it means using one application among dozens, which can be difficult for once-in-a-while users. Alternatively, you can make the data to SharePoint where it can be easily searched, related, and even (securely) exposed for integration via the SharePoint native OData, REST, and WCF interfaces.
