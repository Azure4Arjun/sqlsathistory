## Title: PowerShell Query for the T-SQL Developer
## Abstract:
### This session will show the side-by-side similarity in building a PowerShell query vs T-SQL. I will demo some scripting techiniques in buidling a PowerShell query, building Hash table objects, ways to read and display the information. If the person knows how-to write T-SQL script, then it makes it easy to understand How-To write a PowerShell query.
