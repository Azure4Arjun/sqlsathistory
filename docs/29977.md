## Title: Realizing ROI for Business Intelligence Projects
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence (BI) is IT that IT should never pay for; it should always be aligned and driven by the business. Statistics for failed data warehousing and BI projects are discouraging, but you can prevent this in your organization. In this session we cover how to assess and agree on realistic return on investment (ROI) calculations before, during and after a BI project in addition to other critical considerations that will assure your BI project remains focused on the needs for all stakeholders.
