## Speaker: Eric Berkowitz
## Title: I know what you did last transaction: Auditing using CDC, Temporal Tables and Triggers
## Abstract:
### There have been more advancements in the topic of auditing SQL inserts, updates and deletes during the past few years than in the nearly 30-year history of SQL Server. Eric Berkowitz presents a fast-paced, live demonstration and comparison of Change Data Capture, the new SQL Temporal Tables and conventional trigger-based methods. Gain the ability to audit, research and report on data changes, without recoding existing applications and proactively plan for auditing in new systems. Understand the overhead and performance implications and storage and retention options for each approach. See how querying, DDL changes and compatibility considerations vary among the methods so you can make informed decisions about implementing auditing in your system.
