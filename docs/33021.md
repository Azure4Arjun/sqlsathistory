## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: Tips For The Lazy But Driven DBA
## Abstract:
### Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I’ve developed a toolbox of scripts and arsenal of processes that I rely upon to give insight into disk space, file growth, backup status, Agent job outcomes, and login management.  Some of these I’ve shared on various websites and blogs; others see the light of day for the first time in this session.  Attendees leave the session with processes and code they can begin to use immediately.
