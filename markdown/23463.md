## Title: GeoGRAPHY Spatial Analysis
## Abstract:
### Tired of your PostGIS and Oracle friends bragging about all their geography data?  Microsoft continues to support and add features to the spatial data types.  It is time to let your friends know that Microsoft has stepped up.  In this session we will take a deep look at analyzing the SQL Server Geography spatial data type in T-SQL.  We will look at different scenarios to show how you can begin using the Geography data type.  To begin, we will look at using T-SQL to analyze geographic locations and the surrounding geography data.  Secondly, we will look at using T-SQL to analyze geographic lines such as roads, and borders.
