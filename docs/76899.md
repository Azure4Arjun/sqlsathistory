## Title: On the Cutting Edge with Nodes: Graph Tables in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 introduces new schema extensions that make working with certain types of data easier and potentially more efficient. These graph extensions make it possible to create graph structures consisting of nodes and edges inside the relational database. Graphs are commonly used to describe network topology, but they are also used to model certain other types of data, including hierarchical and complex many-to-many relationships. In this talk, you will receive a brief introduction to graph concepts and some use cases for modeling data as graphs. You will then learn how to apply the new SQL Server extensions to create node and edge type tables, as well as how to efficiently query these structures.
