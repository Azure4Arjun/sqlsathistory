## Title: Row Level Security in the BI Environment
## Abstract:
### Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server, and also even Cell level security in SSAS, to mask data from other users is a common request and a component in your security and data access model for a data warehouse and BI environment.   Information is valuable, but will be a double edge sword if not protected, and should only made visible to only those that should receive it.   In this session, we describe the design considerations, highlight multiple scenarios for querying and reporting, and demonstrate how to apply Row Level Security in both pre-SQL 2016, and implementing it using the new Row Level Security feature in SQL 2016.    We will also touch on briefly cell level security in SSAS.
