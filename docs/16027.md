## Title: Business Insight through Cloud Based Data Models
## Abstract:
### It is common for power users and data scientists to start mocking up their analysis in Excel. As their reporting grows in sophistication, however, it is important to understand the options available to enable increasingly robust analytical capabilities without incurring high infrastructure costs during experimentation phases.

This session will explore promotion paths for PowerPivot models that mature to demand robust data transformations, as well as cleansing and master data procedures. You will learn the pros and cons of using cloud-based PowerPivot environments, as well as the recommended architectures for model growth.
