## Speaker: Mike Walsh
## Title: Azure SQL Databases - There's room for Azure in your BI solutions
## Abstract:
### A SQL Server DBA and performance tuning speaker, speaking at BI event about Azure SQL DB which makes Microsoft your DBA. Strange bedfellows?

Not really. As a BI person you know, it's about the data. More than anything else.  As a DBA and DBA consultant for 17 years, I get that too, but if you aren't pausing to look at Azure SQL Databases and how they may fit into your data management structure you're missing out. If you aren't at least looking at things like Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Warehouses you're missing out.

This session will give you a gentle and guided intro. We'll have a few slides, but mostly we'll be in the Azure Portal and SSMS (talking to Azure). We'll talk about the what and why, migrate a database, run some queries and you can laugh at my ugly Power BI reports if there's enough time to build one. But don't laugh too hard, because in 90 minutes we'll have provisioned a database, migrated to it, queried it and built a simple report...
