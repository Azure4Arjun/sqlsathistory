## Title: Different Types of Many-to-Many Relationships in Power BI
## Abstract:
### The new composite models in Power BI introduced a new type of relationship cardinality, called many-to-many. Nevertheless, despite their name, they are not many-to-many relationships, they are relationships between tables generated at a different granularity.

In this session, we clarify the purpose of the relationships with many-to-many cardinality, highlighting the significant difference with canonical many-to-many relationships. In the meantime, we show how and when to use the different kinds of many-to-many relationships with several practical examples.
