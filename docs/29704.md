## Title: Running Mission Critical Apps on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### This presentation will highlight case studies about some of the largest SQL Server customers who are pushing the envelope with SQL Server in various ways.  This includes scalability in Database size, Transaction throughput and Replication, etc.  This presentation has been given in the past by a member of the SQL Customer Advisory Team (SQLCAT.com), Kevin Cox, who has worked with some of these large customers.  This session will effectively illustrate the capabilities of SQL Server, maybe beyond the limits you thought possible.  This will give you confidence in recommending the use of SQL Server for your most demanding workloads within your organization.
