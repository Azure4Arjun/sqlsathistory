## Title: Bigdata: Into the multi-cloud-verse
## Abstract:
### Data analytics returns more value and uncover profound business insights but as the data grows how do you find a scalable, flexible, cost-effective, and even secure platform for this exponentially growing data? 

Cloud Computing offers access to data storage, processing, and analytics to handle the data volume but how do you decide which platform one to choose? Following up on the last year's The Battle of DBAAS â€“ RDS vs Cloud SQL vs SQL Azure, this time around, we will explore the big data solutions provided by the leading cloud platforms, AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure, and compare key features such as the types of the services on the offer, Data Storage Options, Data Processing Options, Infrastructure Design Challenges, Performance Indicators, Pricing and Data Security on the cloud.
