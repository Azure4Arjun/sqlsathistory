## Title: Introduction to the Stream Analytics query language
## Abstract:
### So you've started sending data into Azure IoT Hub or Event hub and you want to start querying and aggregating your data stream.
The preferred method of doing so is Stream Analytics, a subset of the T-SQL language.
Join me to take a closer look at the language, the possibilities and limitations of it and how to make it work for you.
We will look at inputs and outputs - and see some working samples.
