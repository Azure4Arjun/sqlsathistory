## Title: Improve Your Knowledge of the Optimizer and Statistics!
## Abstract:
### What is the Optimizer, what does it have to do with Statistics?? Database Engines rely on an algorithm to determine the best way to access data.   The power to influence how the data is accessed to achieve the best SQL performance possible is in your hands!!  Focusing on the Optimizer and Statistics, many techniques and tools are available to assist report writers, developers and DBA's in achieving the optimal paths to the data.  I will give you the education you need to consider the options, and a portal into how the optimizer works to help your code work with the optimizer to achieve the better performance.
