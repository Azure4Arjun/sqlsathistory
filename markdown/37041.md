## Title: "But It Sounded So Simple!":  Building a Messaging System in Service Broker
## Abstract:
### There's a lot of general verbiage and API documentation about Service Broker, but how do you fit the queues, services, contracts, and conversations together to actually make something that will work reliably in production?  In this session you'll follow the architecture, design, implementation, and troubleshooting of a simple but production-tested Service Broker messaging framework and get a battlefield-level view of the pitfalls and the payoffs involved in Service Broker development.
