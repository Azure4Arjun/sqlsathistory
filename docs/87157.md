## Title: Intro to Azure for SQL Geeks
## Abstract:
### Interested in using the Cloud for SQL Server? Wondering what is the cloud? Come find out what Cloud Computing is all about and why you might want to use it. We’ll introduce Microsoft’s Cloud, Azure, and talk about how it can be used for *FREE*! We’ll demonstrate creating Virtual Machines in the cloud that can run SQL Server (just like on premises) and we’ll also demonstrate creating SQL Servers in the Cloud using SQL Azure (no virtual machines required).
