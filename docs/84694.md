## Abstract:
### In this session a sample database of athletic performance and wellness is leveraged to deliver insights and analytical capabilities via Power BI. A robust data model, advanced DAX metrics, rich data visualizations, and distribution capabilities in the Power BI web service such as data alerts and email subscriptions all contribute to the overall solution designed to answer top questions such as "Which athletes are making the greatest gains?" and to identify exceptions and trends.
