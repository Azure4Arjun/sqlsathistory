## Title: The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise
## Abstract:
### Every database professional knows the database design ideal and we have all seen that ideal on numerous occasions -  databases in perfect third normal form;  constraints and relational integrity rigorously enforced; elegant error handling in every SQL statement;  data so clean you can eat off it.

Unfortunately we’ve only seen this ideal in textbooks and sample databases designed by vendors.  

The databases we see in the real world are… less than ideal shall we say.  Of course, we use other phrases for what we see but human resources frowns on such terms and this is, after all, a family friendly presentation.  
Database professionals in Greece circa 600 BCE may have access to the Alpheus and Peneus rivers to cleanse their particular stables but we modern folks need to rely on the tools on our own computers such as SQL and SSIS.  Mike will review various techniques and tools for data cleansing that will help you wash away the muck to get to the data gold standard.
