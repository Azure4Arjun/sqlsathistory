## Title: Untangling the spaghetti: Patterns and Anti-Patterns in SQL and ETL development
## Abstract:
### Everyone has heard of "spaghetti code", but not many talk about "spaghetti data". Data environments grow over time, and often databases and servers become a tangled mess; if you had some pasta sauce, you could make lunch out of it! 
In this session I will show the most grievous bad practices, what sorts of problems and constrictions they cause, and how they can be re-written to achieve much looser coupling across all data in an enterprise. Any DBA or developer that uses more than two part table or view names in their queries or stored procedures should attend!
