## Title: Crazy Things Developers Do
## Abstract:
### Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn about SQL Injection attacks and how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.
