## Title: Using Non-Traditional Data Stores in Your Applications
## Abstract:
### The general thinking is that when you create a new application, your data will be persisted into an RDBMS like SQL Server. But with the advent of solutions like document databases, key-value stores and other options, there are some alternatives available for your applications.  In this session we’ll look at some alternatives to your persistence solution by looking at utilizing document databases like Mongo, search services like Solr, key-value stores and other approaches to data persistence. By the end of this session, you’ll rethink how your applications will store data in the future.
