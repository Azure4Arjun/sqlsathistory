## Title: Exploring The Microsoft Reporting Technologies
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft BI Stack provides many different options when it comes to choosing a presentation layer. From PerformancePoint to PowerView the options are plentiful; however each option presents different benefits and is intended for different use cases. In this session I will cover the different presentation options provided by Microsoft and more importantly dive into when and where it is proper to use the different options. I will also demonstrate ways to integrate the different options like including a Reporting Services report in a PerformancePoint dashboard.
