## Speaker: David Moutray
## Title: First Normal Form
## Abstract:
### The Relational Data Model is the foundation of everything we do in SQL Server, and yet I often see basic violations of it.  These violations hurt query performance, compromise data integrity and reduce the value of our business's data.  In this presentation, I cover the most basic aspect of the Relational Data Model:  First Normal Form.  I will describe what it is, common violations of it and the programming problems these violations create.
