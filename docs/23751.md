## Title: Windows Clustering for the DBA
## Abstract:
### You need to implement AlwaysOn Failover Clustering or Availability Groups, but you need help with the Windows Clustering part.  I have you covered.  We'll talk about how to plan for network, DNS, Active Directory, and storage.  I'll even provide you with a check list you can use to plan your implementation.  We'll also discuss quorum, how to decide which one to use, and the effect that choice can have on your Failover Cluster Instance and/or Availability Group.
