## Title: SSIS Monitoring Framework
## Abstract:
### Most Organizations use SSIS as the ETL tool of choice for Data movement. These ETL processes can vary from simple to extremely complex processes. Data from these processes can be consumed by a Data warehouse, various other internal systems or for reporting.
 
Monitoring these ETL processes from a centralized location can be complicated, and many times performance issues only become apparent when the process fails or continues to keep running abnormally. 
We shall talk about a framework to proactively monitor SSIS ETL processes for reporting and analysis and to examine performance trends of SSIS packages across servers over time.
 
This session will discuss the SSIS Monitoring framework and demonstrate a few visualizations to show a performance analysis of ETL processes with minimal effort.
