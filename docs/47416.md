## Title: The first step towards release management for SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you find SQL deployments risky and painful?  Do you struggle to keep track of changes across multiple environments? Do you need to find a balance between automation and human intervention? 

If the business wants you to deploy more frequently but your SQL deployments are a bottleneck, this session may provide you with some answers.
