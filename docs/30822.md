## Title: Encryption in SQL 2008 R2 - Column and TDE
## Abstract:
### We will discuss the “how to’s” of column encryption from the perspective of the DBA, Performance Analyst, Application Architect, and Programmer. We will actually encrypt the “NationalIDNumber” column of the Personel.Employee table in AdventureWorks – and subsequently the entire AdventureWorks database.   I will contrast column encryption with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).  We will also briefly discuss business role changes necessary to support encryption and subsequently DR.
