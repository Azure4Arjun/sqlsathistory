## Title: SSRS â€“ Implementing a Rendering Extension
## Abstract:
### In SSRS, a rendering extension is a component or module of a report server that transforms report data and layout information into a device-specific format. Out of the box, SSRS includes seven rendering extensions: HTML, Excel, Word, CSV, XML, Image, and PDF. During this presentation, Josh will show how to implement and deploy a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) rendering extension for SSRS. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format commonly used in rich client web applications.
