## Title: No More Bad Dates: Using Temporal Data Wisely
## Abstract:
### Temporal data can be confusing in SQL Server. It's no wonder: there are six data types for storing these values. In this session we'll discuss dates, times, and how they are stored internally. We'll talk about how to select a temporal data type and common issues with some types. We'll compare performance of different methods for computing temporal values. We'll also take a look at gotchas in features of SQL Server for which date and time data type choices can be critical. Choose wisely: the correct type and high performing data access logic will help your applications scale and save development and administrative time.
