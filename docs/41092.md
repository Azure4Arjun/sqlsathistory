## Title: Windowing Functions with SQL Server 2016 (Preview)
## Abstract:
### Windowing functions are powerful analytic functions built into SQL Server.  SQL Server 2005 introduced the core window ranking functions, and SQL Server 2012 added time and statistical percentage windowing functions.   These functions allow for advanced variable creation, and are of direct benefit to people creating features for data science.  This talk will also recommend further reading on this topic.
