## Title: Change Data Capture tool for BI,Auditing,DR  more
## Abstract:
### Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available since SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore. On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as in ETL for Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, and more.
