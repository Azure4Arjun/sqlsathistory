# The Haberdashery of Machine Learning
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker: Jan Mulkens
## Title: The Haberdashery of Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### Haberdasheries are various small goods such as buttons, thread and similar sewing goods. When used together correctly, they provide the basis for making good clothes.
Building good Machine Learning solutions is similar, you'll need various small things in your toolkit that you will then leverage build production ready predictive solutions.

In our little Machine Learning shop, you'll receive tips on collaborative data science, automating data pipelines, automated machine learning and will learn how to apply agile methodologies operationalize your experiments in a fast way. We'll even consider the maintenance of your machine learning models afterwards as that often gets overlooked.
Using Azure and SQL Server Machine Learning Services during our examples, you'll be able to take these tips home and apply them yourself.

# The future of serverless computing
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Anton Boyko
## Title: The future of serverless computing
## Abstract:
### Are you still planning your servers capacity in CPU and RAM? Do you enjoy answering questions like “what amount of servers we need to buy to serve 10K and 10M users”? Do you enjoy paying for those servers while they are sitting idle?

In my session I will talk about the current state and the future of serverless computing. I will show several demos that show how to start using serverless computing, what are the application scenarios for it, how it can scale, what it will cost, etc.

This session will be useful for developers and architects who are seeking a way to create an app utilizing all your previous skills, but make it scalable, reliable, fast and cost efficient.

# AI Capabilities for Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Eugene Polonichko
## Title: AI Capabilities for Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI makes it possible for every employee in an organization to make better decisions based on data with beautiful reports and dashboards. But data scientists, who are crucial to deploying AI solutions, don’t have the bandwidth to provide custom solutions to all users at an organization. Businesses need ways to surface the valuable work of data scientists and empower more users to leverage AI in easy and intuitive ways. Power BI can easily help with this problem.

# Attention Contention!!!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Jose Manuel Jurado Diaz
## Title: Attention Contention!!!
## Abstract:
### In this session we will discuss about tempdb contention in SQL Server on-premises, Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database. We will analyze both, Allocation Contention and Metadata contention, describing in detail WHEN and HOW it occurs, How to diagnose it, Best Practices and how to prevent it. The session will have both approaches in on-premisses and in Azure Managed Instance: - Theoretical, to understand what and why it occurs. - Practical, with examples causing it, offering alternatives to solve it and to prevent it.

# What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Taras Kloba
## Title: What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes
## Abstract:
### In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tends to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, I will show how to build a deployment pipeline capable of delivering database and application changes. The pipeline includes the following steps: source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will share methods and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the delivery process reducing the delivery pain. 
The main goal is to understand that applications and databases can and should share the same deployment pipeline and that this pipeline will allow you not be afraid of making database changes.

## Speaker: Catalin Gheorghiu
## Title: ML on the Edge
## Abstract:
### Or options in running TensorFlow on Pi or similar class devices. My idea was (a bit born from need), to run TensorFlow on Pi class device. And this presentation is born from my adventures, showing pro and cons of each approach. From running directly on Pi to Azure IoT Edge on to Intel Neural Stick, and the list most probably is in “works” you will see the challenges and results of implementing TensorFlow using these technologies. Remark: Kinder chocolates have nothing to do with ML but will be present.

# A Game of Hierarchies: Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#860---Lviv-2019)
Event Date: 21-09-2019 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019
## Abstract:
### Hierarchies and graphs are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Networks
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 came with a different approach: Graph Database, which are further improved in SQL 2019.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies and graphs into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

# Report optimization techniques in both Desktop and Service. Vertipaq Engine in Power BI

## Speaker: Ruslan Zolotukhin
## Title: Report optimization techniques in both Desktop and Service. Vertipaq Engine in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI is using In-memory technology, which allows reports to be loaded and presented fast. But here you are limited by CPU and RAM characteristics. Similar behaviour will be when your report is placed at Power BI Service. 

At current session I will describe possible performance issues and how to handle them. We will talk about columnar storage and Vertipaq engine as well. During the session different practice advices will be presented.

## Speaker: Sławomir Drzymała
## Title: Docker for data amateur
## Abstract:
### Even tough it's nothing new, Docker is a thing nowadays. I've decided to check containers out as well and learn how they can help me. Although I'm a BI consultant and not really using Docker and containers in the current projects, I've already found them to be very helpful on my daily basis learning and other activities. If you are also passionate about data and still experimenting with SQL Server and/or Python and/or any other technology, please join the session and see how Docker can change your life. 
I will show you my journey, my thoughts and my findings regarding the usage of SQL Server and Python together with Docker. And there will be a lot, a lot of demos.
