## Title: Become a T-SQL Pivoting Ninja in 60 Minutes Or Less
## Abstract:
### Stop wasting time using Excel Pivot Tables when you can create them with SQL with ease.

Become a query writing ninja who uses the Pivot operator to move unique column values into multiple column names for better data insight with ease. In this demo-heavy presentation, you will learn how to build pivot tables enhanced with multiple aggregate columns and column totals using Rollup and Cube operators, and the grouping function. Attendees will also learn to use the Unpivot Operator.

Come join me, and by the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to level up your pivoting skills to that of a ninja or maybe even *Chuck Norris.
