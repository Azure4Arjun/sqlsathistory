## Title: An Intro to Replication Meta-Data
## Abstract:
### We will cover some basics about setting up simple replication tests and dive into what happens to the underlying meta-data when changes are replicated.  A good opporunity to see a demonstration style explanation of what goes on 'under the hood' during replication.  Scripts will be provided.
