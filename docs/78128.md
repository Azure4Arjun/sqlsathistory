## Speaker: Gilbert Quevauvilliers
## Title: Power BI Writeback with Power Apps
## Abstract:
### Have your users ever asked if it is possible to update a record in a report, and see the results almost immediately?

In this session I will demonstrate how to integrate write back using Power Apps, within a Power BI report.

The session will be almost entirely demo based, in which I will demonstrate how to integrate the Power App with the Power BI report. And then show by updating a record, that the data is almost instantly updated within the Power BI report.
