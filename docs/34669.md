## Abstract:
### This session will provide an introduction to Master Data Management (MDM).  We explore the basic concepts, types of MDM solution, and the basics for a successful MDM Implementation.  With a working definition in hand, we'll discuss strategies for beginning a successful MDM pilot in your organization and look at some of the pitfalls to avoid.  We'll wrap the business discussion up with some tips for selecting the right domains to solve and some tips for managing the politics of MDM.

After we've set the stage for what, how and why you need MDM, we'll take a brief look at SQL Server MDS through the Excel add-in and talk about the Architecture of MDS.
