## Title: Benefits of SSIS ETL automation with BIML
## Abstract:
### Redefining business intelligence ROI is one of Varigences' (The creators of BIML) key headlines.  During this "from the field" session we will step through some real life scenarios where BIML was not only cheaper and faster but better than traditional methods of SSIS development.
We'll also explore some less obvious time savers I've discovered while using BIML for BI implementations.
