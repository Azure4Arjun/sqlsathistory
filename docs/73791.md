## Title: How to Survive Migrating to SQL Server on AWS
## Abstract:
### 10 terabytes of SQL Server data migrated to AWS in two months? I am serious, and don't call me Shirley. In this session we'll cover some of the lessons learned from migrating a $100 million company from ancient on-premises hardware to glistening new EC2 instances in a seriously compressed timeline. 

We'll cover key decisions and considerations on architecture, hardware, high availability and disaster recovery, and how to execute the cut-over with minimal downtime. It wasn't always pretty, but we survived, and you can too.
