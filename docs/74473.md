## Title: TFS for Continous Integration for SSIS and database projects in a Data Warehouse environment
## Abstract:
### Source control and continous integration is standard in software development. However, TFS does not come with the ability to build SSIS projects out of the box. To use the benefits of continous integration, methodologies for automatic deployment and validation of SSIS projects will be presented. Finally, validation of best practices with the help of the testing frameworks Nbi and pester is shown.

The session gives an overview of everything you need to know to setup continous integration including testing and deployment (TFS, msbuild for SSIS, Nbi, pester).

It will help you to:
- Deploy your SISS solution to the next environment with just a click in a web browser
- Never again have out of date meta data in your packages
- Never again have a package not adheering the naming conventions
- Never again have objects in your database project that depend on objects that are not there anymore

For any violation of the above, you will get a mail right after the checkin to fix it right away.
