## Speaker: Craig Bryden
## Title: An Introduction to R and R Services
## Abstract:
### R is the most popular programming language for advanced analytics today. With Microsoft's purchase of Revolution R, we are seeing native integration of R capabilities in the SQL Server 2016 database engine (R Services). We are also seeing R support in most of the Azure cloud products.
In this session I will provide an introduction to the R language as well as discuss how you go about using this inside SQL Server and other Microsoft provided tools.
