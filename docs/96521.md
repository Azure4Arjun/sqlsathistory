## Title: SQL for Product Mangers and Business Line Managers
## Abstract:
### If you’re a product manager or business owner who’s relied on others, be it data analysts, DBAs, or other data professionals to pull data for you to analyze and visualize, then this is the session for you. This session will focus on real-world examples of how to use SQL to get the data you need to improve your product, speed up your innovation cycles, gain product insights faster, and generally become a leaner, more functional product manager through the use of data. 

This session will focus on basic SQL queries that are common for product managers (date ranges, sorting, basic aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT) and useful tools to help make the process easier to implement (Azure Data Studio, Docker, Kitematic, MySQL, Azure SQL, PowerBI, and others). Attendees will come away from this session with a better understanding of SQL and how it can be used and applied for more product and business focused applications and testing.
