## Title: Data Quality Made Simple
## Abstract:
### Imagine your business with fewer integration projects, coming in on time and under budget.  Let us further imagine your business making great decisions based on the right data at the right time.  In this session we will explore the concepts of data quality, as well as some of the tools and initiatives which relate to scoring your data and correcting your business processes for data input.  This is NOT a presentation on Data Quality Services, although we will look at how this new tool might fit within your data quality initiatives.  Return to the office informed and invigorated with the knowledge that bad data can be overcome!
