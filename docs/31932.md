## Speaker: Melissa Coates
## Title: Dashboards...How to Choose Which MSBI Tool?
## Abstract:
### The Microsoft BI stack has a few choices for visualization.  We will explore options, flexibility, limitations, and ease of use for creating dashboards  scorecards with:
  * PerformancePoint Services 2010
  * Reporting Services 2008 R2
  * SharePoint Server 2010
  * PowerPivot
  * Crescent.

This session will be a fun one!  We will compare and contrast options available in each tool, such as:  charts, gauges, maps, indicators, sparklines, data bars, and decomposition trees.  The goal is to determine when you might choose one tool in the Microsoft BI stack versus another.
