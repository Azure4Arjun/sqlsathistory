## Title: Automate Data Warehouse build and deployment (db,SSIS  SSAS) with Visual Studio 2015 and TFS
## Abstract:
### See a demonstration of automated generation, build and deployment of a Data Warehouse (database, SSIS and SSAS) using Visual Studio 2015 and 'Visual Studio Team Services' Online.

It's not enough to 'do' Agile you must 'be' Agile...

This means  modifying, building and deploying your DW/BI solution, on a daily/weekly basis. Achieving this without automation is very difficult. 

Topics include:

1. Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services Online licencing for BI developers (things have changed).
2. A primer on setting up a project in 'Visual Studio Team Services'.
3. Automated Data Warehouse development (code generation) in Visual Studio 2015.
4. Using MSBUILD, Source Control and Build  Release functionality of 'Visual Studio Team Services' to automate the build and deployment of a Data Warehouse, SSIS and SSAS Cubes to multiple environments.

Grab a free script at the end to get you started.
