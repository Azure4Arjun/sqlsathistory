## Title: Whatâ€™s new for SQL Server Analysis Services?
## Abstract:
### So, do we stick with the Cube or move to Tabular? Has DAX functionality improved enough to rely on performance with DirectQuery in a Tabular Model? Will we be porting Analysis Service (SSAS) databases to Azure? How do we know what level or pricing model is adequate for an Azure SSAS database?
When an SSAS database gets created, and users start to report against, it is very hard not to continue to expand the model. Anxiety is released when a new release of SSAS comes along adding functionality to replace the hooks created to satisfy user requirements. With 2016 and 2017, Microsoft is moving to update Tabular Models with more features, improved performance and better security. The Cube additions are mainly with Data Sources and better T-SQL generated to access source databases like Oracle and Teradata.
So, let us examine the pros and cons together and get a consensus of the path forward with SSAS. You are definitely not going to want to stop using this tool.
