## Title: Uniting Free Government Data using PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### In recent years, governments throughout the world have made large volumes of data available for public use.  Vast data with detailed insights into verticals such as healthcare, census, weather, natural resources, land use, financial markets, and economics are available to be extracted, transformed, joined and unleashed.  In this session PowerPivot will be used to tie data together for analysis.  Examples include uniting commodity prices with weather patterns, integrating free healthcare data with economic data, and integrating US economic data with that of other countries.
