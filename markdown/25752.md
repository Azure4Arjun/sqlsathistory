## Title: Exploring SQL Server  Join Types – INNER, OUTER, and much more
## Abstract:
### Joining tables is one of the fundamental aspects of any relational database, but the different ways of joining tables are often misunderstood.
Learn about INNER JOINS, OUTER JOINS (LEFT, RIGHT and FULL), OUTER JOIN with exclusions, CROSS JOIN. Also find out how multiple INNER JOINS impact your result set versus multiple OUTER JOINS.
