## Title: Keeping up with the JOINes
## Abstract:
### Very few queries can be written without an Inner Join, but Full Outer Joins and few and far between. This session will cover the less common join scenarios through slides and code samples. Learn to use the data model and requirements to recognize the join type. Come away with the confidence to give examples and incorporate the new material in your own queries.
