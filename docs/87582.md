## Title: Always Encrypted in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Always Encrypted was added to SQL Server 2016 and is being enhanced in SQL Server 2019 to easily allow developers and DBAs to protect their data with strong encryption. Come learn how to design and implement Always Encrypted, including a discussion of the requirements, capabilities, and limitations for your environment. We will discuss the places where this encryption mechanism makes sense while showing the ease with which this can be added to an application while providing the potential architectural issues you may encounter.
