## Title: Dodo - Using PowerShell to Deploy TSQL to Multiple Servers
## Abstract:
### Do you have multiple servers in your environment?  
Do you have have multiple databases that share the same schema on the same instance (sharding)?
Do you wish you had a simple way to run a TSQL script against an instance without having to use SSMS?
Do you tire of other people forgetting to deploy to one of your servers?
Do you wish you had a way to communicate when someone deployed code to an instance?
Do you enjoy ASCII art?
Are you lazy?

If you answered yes to any of the above and wish you had an easier way to "Right click file(s)" and just deploy them to instance(s), I think I might have the solution for you.  This is a free and open source PowerShell based solution that you are welcome to use.  It can rely on a CMS (Central Management Server) or CSV file for server list.  

This doesn't solve the need for a proper release process or CI Automation but sometimes you just need to do things manually.
