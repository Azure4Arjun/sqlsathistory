## Title: Data Modeling for the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### A theoretical discussion on the topic of graphical data modeling using enterprise modeling tools.

I this session, we will discuss why we model data, the different modeling types, and different modeling techniques. We will explore why and when to use different modeling techniques and we will explain how to use dimensional modeling when developing data warehouses, SSAS Cubes, and Power BI Analytics.

“Real World” sample model diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques in an attempt to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion.
