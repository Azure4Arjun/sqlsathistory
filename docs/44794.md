## Speaker: John Pertell
## Title: "R" You Ready For SQL 2016?
## Abstract:
### R is one of the fastest growing programming languages, useful for data analysis and visualization. You've been able to connect to SQL databases to work with large data sets before using R packages. But now, with the upcoming SQL 2016 release, R will be included as an Advanced Analytics Extension. You'll be able to run the same R scripts right in your database. 

In this beginner session we will look at how to set up R on your SQL instance. We'll work with some sample data to show how R works with SQL inside and outside the database with some basic R commands. And we'll create some graphs and charts for use in some SSRS reports.
