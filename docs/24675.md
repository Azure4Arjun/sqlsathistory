## Title: Dashboard Do's and Don'ts
## Abstract:
### SharePoint makes it easy for users to create their own dashboards but there's more to dashboards than just fast and easy set-up. This session will explore not only the characteristics of an effective BI dashboard using SharePoint 2013, but also the design flaws to avoid. Attend this session and learn how to perform a dashboard makeover. Starting with a review of a dashboard that uses technology correctly but not as effectively as it could, youâ€™ll explore common problems found in dashboards, learn the characteristics of good dashboard design and discover how to implement a dashboard that communicates information clearly and concisely.
