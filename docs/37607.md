## Speaker: Eric Freeman
## Title: CTE's and Recursion in T-SQL
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn various uses of Common Table Expressions, how to declare, stack CTE's, and how to use recursive CTE's. Examples will be shared of how they can be used in useful and not so useful (but informative) ways. This session is intended for those comfortable using T-SQL but wanting to learn more about what is available. My intention is to heavily cover recursive CTEâ€™s in this session. We will also go over windowed functions which will be used in some CTE examples.
