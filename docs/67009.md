You will learn how PowerBI can connect to data that exists on-premise as well as in the cloud. that data can then be cleansed, transformed and then modelled to allow the discovery of powerful new insights that can then easily be shared with colleagues and clients. Finally, we will discuss the licencing model behind PowerBI which ranges from the free Desktop tool through to Premium licencing options.
