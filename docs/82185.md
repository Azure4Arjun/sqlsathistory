## Title: In memory database... Let's rethink that request!
## Abstract:
### Many times users or management ask for something that they've heard about but don't quite understand, in hope of solving a problem that doesn't quite make sense. It is possible to put a SQL Server database in memory, and memory is faster than disk, so this has just got to be a good idea!

This session looks at what you can do to put a database in memory, at what problems that can help, and at what problems it won't affect noticeably. It also looks at the recommended way to put tables into memory and the problems that will solve.
