## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed, scalable service based on SQL Server technology. Yet “fully-managed” does not necessarily mean that many or all of the tasks and responsibilities of the DBA are managed and executed by Microsoft or the service itself. The DBA is very crucial in Windows Azure SQL Database, and this session will take a look at the all-important role of the DBA when working with Windows Azure SQL Database. This session will look at how many of the on-premises functions, tasks, and responsibilities of the DBA are accomplished in a cloud environment, specifically Windows Azure SQL Database.  This session will also look at the tips, tricks, and best practices a DBA should know for accomplishing similar on-premises tasks in the cloud.
