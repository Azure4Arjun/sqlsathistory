## Title: Azure Security, Cost, and Capabilities
## Abstract:
### Security, cost, and capabilities are the key questions for any Azure project. Nothing should be implemented today without a tested security surface. Creating a strong and flexible identity perimeter will allow for secure access. Platform security will create a secured perimeter for all of your cloud resources from Virtual Machines and Networks to resource locks and permissions. Manage customized security alerts, and configure a playbook for specific threats. Configure security for data infrastructure, and data encryption at rest. Implement security for applications such as certs, monitoring, and security baselines. Data and applications will not last long if costs are not managed from the beginning. You will need to monitor and analyze the cost of your Azure resources as soon as development begins. Azure Cost Management allows you to create a budget. The biggest factor in security, and cost management is implementing the right capabilities to support your business requirements.
