## Abstract:
### This Modern Migration Tour session is a free training event for Microsoft Data professionals and those wanting to learn about SQL Server, Business Intelligence and Analytics. 

End of support for SQL Server 2008 is almost here (ends in July!), which means it’s time to take flight on your migration strategy.
But, do you have a plan in place? What approach should you take to ensure a smooth transition?
To guide you through these questions, PASS, Microsoft, and Intel® have teamed up for a series of expert-led events, giving you all the tools you need to get to the final destination—a modern data platform.
Not only will you receive insightful views on migration, but you’ll also walk away with an actionable plan for the year ahead.
