## Title: Care and feeding of AWS RDS Instances
## Abstract:
### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service ( RDS) offers a simple way  to set up, operate, and scale SQL Server databases  in the cloud. While deploying new managed instances is simple, there are limitations in the migration paths, tuning and maintenance tasks that any DBA can perform. In this session we will show how to use AWS CLI interface to deploy configure and maintain instances using  PowerShell  or Linux, migration paths to the AWS cloud and  learn more about the options available for  tuning AWS RDS SQL Server databases.
