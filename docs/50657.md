## Title: Hitchhikers Guide to Table Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Table partitioning can be daunting and may not work as expected. You may have tried to implement partitioning only to find you created greater performance issues. In this session you will be taken through the theory of table partitioning with practical examples you can use. We will learn what partitioning is, what it is not, how to implement it, how to maintain it, how to use it for maintenance and how you can improve query performance under certain conditions. After this session you will have the confidence to apply partitioning in your environment.
