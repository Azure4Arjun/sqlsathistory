# SQLSaturday #229 - Dublin 2013
Event Date: 22-06-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Charlemont 3
## Speaker: Matt Masson
## Title: Cats, Facebook, and Online Dating with Microsoft BI
## Abstract:
### The BI Power Hour is a popular session at the PASS Summit and TechEd conferences that shows off the power and versatility of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack through demos that contain little to no real world business value. Unlike most technical sessions at these conferences, the goal of the Power Hour is to entertain rather than educate. Any learning the audience experiences is purely accidental. For the past three years I’ve been a Power Hour presenter and have put together a number of demos that use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in non-standard ways. This session will take a look at these demos, show how they were built, and talk about some of the key things I’ve learned while putting them together.
