## Title: SQL Server 2012 Always On - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
## Abstract:
### Our SQL Server 2012 Always On system with 12 months in production and an 8TB data, you can learn from our experiances, the Good (yes, there are some really cool features), the Bad (not really bad, but features you need to know about) and the Ugly (outagess, causes and resolutions).  The session will cover the new SQL Server 2012 Always on functionality and provide hands on examples to features along with a review of how we used SQL Server Always on in a VLDB environment.
