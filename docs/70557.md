## Speaker: Regis Baccaro
## Title: Hybrid BI DevOps
## Abstract:
### In this session we are going to build a DevOps framework for Azure Data Factory, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, Power BI Report Server and for the databases used within the entire ETL/DW process. 
We use Visual Studio Online for source control, development and integration. Development changes are automatically deployed to on-premises or the Cloud using SQL Server, Azure SQL Databases, Azure VMs and Azure Data Factory v2. We will show how we can build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline between environments, pushing the schema changes and upgrading the version numbers in a seamless manner upon successful build of the solutions. Furthermore we'll come with a list of best practices to follow and pitfalls to avoid when going down the DevOps road.
