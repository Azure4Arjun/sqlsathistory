## Title: The Why and How of Partitioned Tables
## Abstract:
### Previously restricted to Enterprise Edition, partitioning was one of the features pushed down to all Editions in SQL 2016 SP1. With greater availability comes greater responsibility to make sure it is implemented appropriately.
This session will demonstrate some of the common pitfalls with implementing partitioning:
•	how excessive data movement can kill performance
•	how poor maintenance can negate the performance gains
We’ll then look at how to plan and implement partitioning appropriately and some of the corresponding benefits that can be realised from a well implemented and managed partition scheme:
•	how to automatically maintain a partition scheme
•	how to implement a sliding window for data loading and archiving
•	how to plan and implement partitioning to limit data movement
Finally, we will consider the additional options open to us with partitioned tables from both the maintenance perspective, and the coding and tuning perspective.
