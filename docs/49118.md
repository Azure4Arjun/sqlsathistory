## Speaker: Phil Ekins
## Title: Availability Groups:  Monitoring and Alerting
## Abstract:
### So you have your availability groups configured and everything reports green.  How do you measure SLA compliance? Do you know when replication is delayed? Did you know it failed over last night?
This session will answer all these questions and more, and will show you what should you be looking at to ensure no surprises...
We will look at the DMVs, extended event sessions, perfmon counters, SQL agent jobs and policies to show what to monitor in your AG and how to setup alerts so you know when to take action.
