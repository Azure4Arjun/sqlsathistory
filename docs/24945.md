## Title: Data Vault – What is it?  Where Does It Fit?
## Abstract:
### As a Data Warehouse / ETL developer who sometimes waits weeks or months without capturing or loading any source data while a new data warehouse / mart target model is being defined, would you instead like to be able get ahead of the curve by – quickly and mostly automatically – designing and even loading a robust and fully history-tracking DW / staging repository?  Or, have the recent requests from sponsors – requests that your DW reporting / analytics solution also supply data for upcoming Master Data Management needs – got you a little nervous about your data transformations?  If either of these scenarios resonate, you will appreciate Data Vault, an emerging DW design and architecture.  Leaving this session, you will be familiar with Data Vault’s simple design fundamentals, appreciate its potential for task automation, and understand where and when it fits your needs.
