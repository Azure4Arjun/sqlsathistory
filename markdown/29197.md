### Whether you are new to SQL Server or you just haven't had the opportunity to learn about it, Integration Services can be a powerful tool to have at your disposal.

We'll review best practices for setting up packages for file imports and exports as well as transferring data between servers and automation of packages. Finally, we'll review more advanced processing techniques, deployment options, logging, and implementation of version history through source control.
