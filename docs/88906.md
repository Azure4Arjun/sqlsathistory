## Title: Continuous Deployment  Continuous Integration with Azure DevOps  Visual Studio
## Abstract:
### Many companies are switching over from the waterfall model to the agile software development process with the hopes of bringing quality software quicker to market.  Under this process, requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams and their customer(s) or user(s).  Some principle ideas of this process are adaptive planning, early delivery, continuous improvement, and flexible response to change.

Azure DevOps is the next generation of Visual Studio Team Services.  This product combines sprint planning, task assignment, version control, testing, continuous deployment and continuous integration into one service.  

During this presentation we will explore how to migrate the Adventure Works Data Warehouse schema to the cloud, create a database project in Visual Studio 17, setup development and production environments, check code into a Git repository and track new project features using agile techniques.  Come and learn the power of DevOps.
