## Title: Improved Online Operations in SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### Join me on this session to listen about the improvements in SQL Server 2014 on operations that have become possible to be made online, such as "rebuild" a single partition on partitioned objects and priority management on "locks" in DDL operations, for example on "switch partition" operations, reducing the operating time of such maintenance and causing the least possible impact on the normal functioning of our database.
