## Title: Introducing the Reimagined Power BI Platform 
## Abstract:
### You have seen glimpses of the new Power BI platform during the Public Preview reveal. Although it may not be readily apparent, Microsoft has totally reimagined the Power BI platform and user experience for BI professionals, developers and business users.  In this new release, Microsoft has added Power BI Designer, developer APIs, custom templates/apps, hybrid direct connectivity to on-premise data sources without data copying, a native mobile BI app and other top secret enhancements that we can dive into by the time of this session. Please join me to further explore all these great changes and enjoy a fun demo-intensive session.
