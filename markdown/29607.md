## Title: Why I Use Stored Procedures
## Abstract:
### With the proliferation of ORM tools like Entity Framework, nHibernate, and Linq to SQL, many projects have decided that stored procedures are not needed and slow down development.  While these tools have their place and have improved greatly, stored procedures still have their place, and, in this speaker's opinion, are the best way to do data access.  In this session I'll discuss my reasons for using stored procedures and hopefully stimulate some discussion of other access methods.
