# Applying Data Warehousing Principles
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-806)
Event Date: 20-10-2018 - Session time: 08:45:00 - Track: Design
## Speaker: Spencer Swindell
## Title: Applying Data Warehousing Principles
## Abstract:
### Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.

## Title: Keeping Data Science Simple in Azure Machine Learning Studio
## Abstract:
### As data science becomes a key buzzword that attracts many ears, people often try to overcomplicate the field of Data Science with fancy visualizations, algorithms and terminology. In its most basic form, data science can be broken down into three equal parts that consist of:
1.	Addressing a business problem
2.	 Understanding the data
3.	 Conducting and executing a “science” experiment.  

In this session we will walk through how to approach a data science problem in various phases using predictive analytics in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs
## Abstract:
### We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure. All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated. In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know. So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.

## Speaker: Sandra Peele
## Title: Index Trek
## Abstract:
### When learning something new, it’s helpful to have a foundation.  Yet, indexes are often taught with only one or two sentences of explanation before CREATE INDEX.  I recall a student, exasperated by the textbook definition saying, “Will someone just SHOW ME an index!”  The goal of this high level presentation is to do just that.  In this 50 minute mission, we’ll explore nonclustered and clustered indexes as well as the strange new world of columnstore indexes.  Rather than focus on space and time requirements of indexes and index maintenance, we’ll seek out new understanding:

•	Why well-designed indexes speed up queries.
•	Why queries must be engineered carefully to use indexes.
•	Why indexes have both benefits and drawbacks.

After the mission, you’ll be prepared to further explore the galaxy of indexes.

## Title: Use Python to Make Better Email Reports With Graphs
## Abstract:
### Email reports are common and useful for reporting when a process succeeded or failed. You might have also figured out how to make it easier to read with HTML content, and even HTML tables. Sometimes, it still needs more, and needs to be easier.

Come see how to use Python to add graphs of your data to emails as a picture. Plus, you'll see some easier ways to create HTML content for emails using Python.

You'll be surprised how little code is needed for this. It's simpler than you think!

## Speaker: Edward Roepe
## Title: The Ultimate Maintenance Plan
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.

## Title: Avoid Shiny Object Syndrome and Create Visualizations That Last
## Abstract:
### You’ve spent days (or even weeks) getting the data perfect. After a few days, you've put together a dashboard that is so flashy it could be on display in Times Square. You check in with the stakeholders a month later only to learn they no longer use it. :(

Your diagnosis: Shiny Object Syndrome. It’s real. It’s prevalent. And almost completely preventable.

In this session you will leave with 5 field-tested rules to follow when creating visualizations that will make your users return to your dashboard over and over…and compel them to share it with others!

## Speaker: Jamie Wick
## Title: SQL Restore: Optimizing Your Data Recovery
## Abstract:
### When disaster strikes, everyone's immediate question becomes: How long until the system is back online?  Whether it's a single database or the whole SQL environment, time is essential... As everyone waits on the restore to complete. 

How long will the restoration process take?  
Can it run faster? 

In this session, we'll answer these questions by looking at how to establish and maintain a Restoration Baseline and the options available for performance tuning database restores.

# Custom Auditing in SSIS

## Speaker: Meghana Vasavada
## Title: Custom Auditing in SSIS
## Abstract:
### In order to effectively monitor SSIS performance, troubleshoot errors and understand the data linage in the production environment one needs to implement the package logging and Data auditing. SSIS already contains an Audit Transformation Component that captures information about the package metadata and the environment in which the package runs.

However, what if you encountered an error, or a package failure?  Suppose, a Data warehouse developer is performing an ETL to load a Dimension of a Data mart and would like to track the Data being processed. Audit Transformation Component cannot perform the job effectively.

So lets have an insight of how Auditing can be done by designing an SSIS  package that captures the Error information, DML operation on the table (Inserts/Updates/Deletes) along with the package metadata.

We'll create a package with an event handler that loads Data from a Staging to Dimension and creates an Audit table to track information on Data processing.
