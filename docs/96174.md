## Title: Reporting Services Tips, Tricks, Templates and Considerations
## Abstract:
### This session is an overview of some of the features and capabilities of Reporting Services.  In it you will see a variety of reports styles and template considerations and get an understanding of the power of Linked Reports and Shared Data Sets along with a brief look at some of the Enterprise Edition capabilities with KPIs and Mobile Reports. 
We will also cover how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine which reports are being utilized and determine which reports to migrate to a new implementation of SSRS.  Come see how you can use PowerShell to extract the reports and datasets from the database in order to build a new solution for deployment to a new server.

Experience managing SSRS and ideally an understanding of the ReportServer database is useful but not required in order to benefit from this session.
