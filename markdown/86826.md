## Title: Grudge Match: XML vs JSON
## Abstract:
### Starting in SQL 2016, two rivals entered the ring in a professional fight for format supremacy. XML seems too fat to compete with the newcomer JSON but a fight has begun.  JSON doesn't seem experienced enough to have real punching power but does it have the speed to win?  Who is the pound for pound format champion?  Come watch this action-packed bout between two titans of SQL.
