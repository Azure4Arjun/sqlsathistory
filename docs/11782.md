## Title: Enterprise-level auditing on a Standard Edition budget
## Abstract:
### In SQL Server 2008, Microsoft finally introduced a first-class auditing tool for monitoring what's going on in your databases.  Unfortunately, that's an Enterprise Edition feature.  What about those of us running Standard Edition?  In this demo-heavy session, we'll learn about auditing methods for the masses, including triggers, event notifications, SQL Trace, and extended events.
