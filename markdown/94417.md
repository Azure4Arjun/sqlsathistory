## Title: Getting Started with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
## Abstract:
### In this session, geared toward beginner level users, attendees will be introduced to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) as a tool for customized reporting. We will first review the SSRS workspace in Visual Studio 2017 to familiarize users with the various components that can be used when building reports. We will then look at a few examples of reports to see some of those components in action, focusing on the usage of parameters and expressions to provide flexibility, before finally building a sample report together. We will conclude by walking through the deployment process and discussing both basic and data-driven subscription options for automated report delivery.

This session is designed for users with little to no familiarity with SSRS who are looking for a baseline understanding of the tool, who want to begin working more with SSRS development, or who need to support SSRS in their current role but do not know where to begin.
