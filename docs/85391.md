## Title: Be careful! Unexpected behaviour with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### Several times in Sql Server we have to deal with unexpected behaviour and situations that can leave you confused and that seldom can even lead to disasters. The causes of that are often hidden into details, lack of attention or know-how, haste and carelessness.
In this session I will go through some topics and examples that demonstrate that. Most of them derive from real situations I have faced or that someone has told me, with the addition of several classical examples.
This session will be useful in order to avoid some pitfalls in which we could fall during our daily work.
