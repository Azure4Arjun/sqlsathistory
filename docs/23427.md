## Title: Using Azure Machine Learning to Predict Melbourne House Prices
## Abstract:
### House prices are a topic of conversation at every BBQ and dinner table across Melbourne.  Have you ever wondered what drives house prices or wanted to predict an outcome in advance?  This interactive session firstly introduces the What, How  Why of Predictive Analytics and then provides an overview of using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) for making predictions in the context of Melbourne House Price data.  The session explores using Azure ML regression algorithms and other statistical techniques to build an Azure ML experiment to first discover what features influence prices and then builds an Azure ML predictive Web Service solution based on those features.  In the process of learning Azure ML regression, and with a bit of luck, we may even come up with a model that works!
