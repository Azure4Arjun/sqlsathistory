## Abstract:
### Have you ever thought what would it be like to run SQL Server engine in a small footprint? Well, wait no more. 

Running on Arm and x64 architecture with a reduced footprint, the proven performant and most secure Microsoft SQL engine is coming to the Edge in interactive devices and edge gateways. Combining new capabilities on data streaming and time-series, with in-database machine learning (ML), Azure SQL Database Edge is optimized for low-latency analytics right on the Edge. This session will showcase the scenarios Azure SQL Database Edge can enable.
