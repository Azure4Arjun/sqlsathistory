## Title: Technical Debt with Woody Pewitt
## Abstract:
### Technical debt is the cost of putting off good development practices. This debt must be paid back to avoid the “interest payments” becoming crippling. This presentation will focus on a number of common developer (and project) anti-patterns that can lead to the buildup of technical debt in a project and, having identified these behaviors, we’ll look at techniques to firstly quantify and then to mitigate against them.
