## Title: Grabbing the brass ring: tools for better self-advocacy in the tech workplace
## Abstract:
### Have you ever felt passed up for a promotion or a stretch assignment because you identify as a woman, non-binary and/or as BIPOC (black, indigenous, or a person of color)? Have you ever had a chance to reach for the proverbial brass ring but did not or was prevented from doing so? 
Many workplaces endeavor to create an inclusive and equitable workplace but end up missing the mark by perpetuating systemic biases that impact the ability for folks to realize their fullest career potential, or even get access to the game at all. 
Join a panel of prolific speakers from PDX Women In Tech who will address topics like what to do when gender and/or race set the tone for the environment, and what to do when leadership doesnâ€™t recognize an opportunity to promote equity. 
Audience (all are welcome) will be able to learn new ways to approach self-advocacy (or, in the case of allies, advocacy) and tips and techniques to further the conversation around equity and inclusion in their workplace.
