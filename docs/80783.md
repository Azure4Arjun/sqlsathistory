## Title: Automate DWH  BI development using TimeXtender Discovery Hub®
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will demonstrate the power of Discovery Hub® by building an end-to-end solution from scratch in just 30min. We automate the majority of the tedious tasks related to a DWH project with high quality auto-generated scripts, documentation, data lineage tracing managed deployment/execution and many other value-adding features. We accelerate BI projects dramatically and allows BI developers to focus their efforts on the tricky modelling tasks, rather than the majority of standard technical steps.

Speaker: Mahmoud Ismail 
Mahmoud is a Solution Architect in TimeXtenders Customer Service  Success team and has significant experience in implementing and utilizing the Discovery Hub in a number of industries and sectors. He also has excellent knowledge in regards to data modelling for both Qlik applications, OLAP Cubes and Tabular models. He takes part in a lot of projects ranging, from presales, training consulting and hands-on DWA developing.
