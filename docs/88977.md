## Title: Introduction to Data Science With Python
## Abstract:
### “Python” and “R” are two well-known data science languages being used today. Both of these languages are part of the open source community and have many free modules available for your use.

Which one of the languages do you choose as an enterprise standard?

My money is on the “Python” language, due to the fact it can be used to solve business problems other than ones related to data science.

Python is a general purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed for readability and easy syntax by using significant whitespace. The main goal was to allow programmers to solve problems using fewer lines of code.

During this pre-conference course, we will be covering the following topics.

Python Programming Basics
Introduction to Data Science with Python

This course is meant for beginners who want to learn Python. At the end of the day, you will have a solid understanding of the language and an introduction to the data science libraries.
