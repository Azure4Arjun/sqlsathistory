## Title: ADO.NET Data Services for DBAs
## Abstract:
### The idea of exposing data across the Internet is a scary thought for most DBAs, but ADO.NET Data Services provides the security to allow you to feel better about how its handled.  Since so many applications now require the Internet, ADO.NET Data Services represents a sensible way to provide that data.  Come to this talk to be talked down from the ledge of fear about the technology.
