## Title: Azure SQL Data Warehouse for beginners
## Abstract:
### When On-Premise Data Warehouses are not the only option, many questions arise surrounding Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

This session will cover the fundamentals of using Azure SQL Data Warehouse. From a beginner's perspective, the benefits of using this product will be discussed, as well as pricing measurements and the differences from Azure SQL Database and Big Data.

I will explain how to deploy this service in only a few minutes by using some of the latest features such as extracting data from Azure Data Lakes and Azure Blob Storage through PolyBase.
