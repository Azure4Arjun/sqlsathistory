## Abstract:
### Organizing the Chaos
Utilizing JIRA  Confluence to bring clarity to your projects and teams

Do you have a difficult time keeping your teams organized?  Do you struggle with providing real time reporting on your projects?  Do you feel like your project tracking system is difficult to customize?
We will show you how we have used JIRA and Confluence to organize and increase the visibility of not only our IT projects, but also our non-IT projects.  We will also show you how these tools allowed us to improve client communication and satisfaction for a variety of our service lines.
