## Title: ADO.NET Synchronization Services in .NET 3.5
## Abstract:
### Explore how you can build offline smart client applications in a RAD way that synchronizes backend database with a local Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition store using the Microsoft Synchronization Services for ADO.NET. Use the Microsoft Visual Studio Designer to help build a two-tier application and N-tier application that incrementally downloads data that can be cached on a SQL Server Compact Edition store. We can also explore how to perform bidirectional synchronization with conflict detect
