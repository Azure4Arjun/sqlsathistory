## Title: Multisite Clusters for HA and Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Windows Server 2008 R2 failover clustering supports the concept of a "multisite cluster", which provides an excellent disaster recovery and high availability solution for SQL Server. This session will describe the concept of a multisite cluster and why it provides the best recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for all of your SQL Server databases and other applications. Configuration details, known issues and a live demonstration will complete this session. After this session the attendee should be armed with the knowledge to propose a robust disaster recovery solution for any environment.
