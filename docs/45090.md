## Title: Simplifying SQL Server Migrations using PowerShell
## Abstract:
### What if migrating SQL Server instances was as simple as executing a single command? 

In this presentation, I'll cover the reasons companies migrate, the ways SQL migrations are usually performed, and the considerations that must be made when performing a migration.

Then I'll show you how to use the PowerShell dbatools module to simplify your SQL Server migrations. dbatools makes migrating databases, logins, linked servers, credentials, jobs, database mail, and other essential SQL components extremely easy.
