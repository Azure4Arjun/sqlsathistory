## Title: Building nTier Applications with Entity Framework 
## Abstract:
### Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the Entity Framework and related services. With this new technology built into .NET, you can easily wrap an object model around your database and have all the data access automatically generated or use your own stored procedures and views. Then learn how to easily and securely expose your object model using WCF with just a few line of code using WCF Data Services. The session will demonstrate how to create and consume these new technologies from the ground up.
