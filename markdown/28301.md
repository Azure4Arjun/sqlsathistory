## Title: MDS + DQS + SSIS = EIM or How to build master data management solution
## Abstract:
### The process of entering data into corporate dictionary is not as simple as you can see at the first glance. Just imagine the process of collection information about the new retail store. It starts from discovering the possible place, then estimating the size, format and revenue, making a decision to buy or rent this place and so on. At the end you have to liquidate the goods remained unsold, reassign you workers to another store, demount all equipment, close accounts, etc.  This process may involve 5, 10 and even 20 different workers who collect and enter different pieces of information about a retail store.
At this session we will talk about the approaches of creating a master data management solution and take a look at the implementation with the services of Microsoft SQL Server 2012.
