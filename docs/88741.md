## Title: Blogging for Success: Advancing your career by blogging
## Abstract:
### Ever wanted to start a 'blog, but have no idea how to do it?  It's easier than you think!  A number of people have become successful by writing 'blog articles.  I originally started my 'blog to supplement my presentations.  Since then, it's taken on a life of its own.

In this presentation, I'll tell you how I got started with 'blogging, where it's taken me since then, and lessons I've learned along the way.  We'll discuss 'blog platforms, how to get started, what to write about, and what to do (and what NOT to do) when writing articles.
