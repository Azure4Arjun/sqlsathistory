## Title: The future of C#
## Abstract:
### C# 6 is out this year, but what's after that? We'll take a look at the features the language design team is working on for C# 7, such as pattern matching and record types. We'll dive deep into how these language features work, what impact they'll have on your code, and what this means for the direction of C# and programming in general.
