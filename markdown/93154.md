## Title: Microsoft Power BI Deployment Types
## Abstract:
### This session gives you an overview how Microsoft Power BI can be deployed. The Focus is on the Cloud, Hybrid and on Premises.  After the session you will have an idea which type should be the best for each scenario, because every project has different requirements. So there is no right or bad way â€“ it depends on the project and also on the budget and some other regularities.
