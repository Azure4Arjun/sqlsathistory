## Title: Accelerating Insights with Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will review the Azure Databricks Unified Analytics Platform and introduce best practices for development. When used together they can significantly accelerate your time to Analytic Insights, facilitate collaboration among Data Engineers, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists, and permit everyone on your project to work with any Data, at any Volume, any Velocity. We will cover best practices for data ingestion and movement of data through the zones of the data lake and data warehouse. Then we will show how you can use this platform for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Analytics.
