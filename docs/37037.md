## Title: Desigining Complex Tabular Models - A Case Study
## Abstract:
### While building of Tabular Models may be straight forward it rapidly becomes more complex when you steer off-piste and into more complex design pattern such as:
- Many to Many relationships
- Semi-Additive Measures
- Last Ever Non Empty
- Events in Progress
- Versioned Fact Tables
- Almost real time processing requirements
- Huge volume
- Non Star Schema Data Warehouses
- measure explosion and lack of calculated dimensions
- Selecting Hardware

This one hour session will walk through an actual case study of a tabular model and discuss the pain points we encountered on the way, along with solutions and workarounds.
