## Title: ETL best practices on Azure using Data Factory
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a hybrid data integration service that provides you with an intuitive visual drag-and-drop environment (data flow) for code-free ETL. 
In this session, we will talk about design patterns for building scalable data pipelines for Big Data workloads! We will not cover ADF basics in this talk so having background knowledge about ADF would be recommended.
