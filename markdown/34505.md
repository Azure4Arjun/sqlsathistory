## Speaker: William Durkin
## Title: You don't need Enterprise Edition to do that!
## Abstract:
### The most coveted features of SQL Server are made available in Enterprise Edition and are sometimes released into Standard Edition a few years later. This often leaves a vast group of users who "window shop" the latest and greatest features and return to the office wishing they never saw those features presented. This session will show you how you can achieve the same, or at least a similar, outcome to those features without having to fork out for Enterprise Edition licenses or breaking any license agreements. You will leave the session with a set of solution concepts that you can build upon or extend and maybe save you and your company a nice pile of cash.
