## Title: Leveraging Flash Technologies for Increased SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### Over the past few decades we have witnessed a chronic and widening imbalance among processor bandwidth, disk capacity, and access speed of disk.  There has been an exponential increase in performance for CPU and network over the last several years, yet the speed of traditional drives has not kept pace.  This suggests that the performance of an OLTP system would be seriously limited without a considerable improvement in I/O throughput.  Since the market debut of flash memory SSD a few years ago, storage vendors have made a continued effort to overcome SSD’s poor random write performance and to provide stable and sufficient I/O throughput.  Today we now have an extensive array (pun intended) of flash solutions that can provide real benefits to SQL Server deployments.  In this session you will learn:
•	The evolution of disk and Flash storage
•	The Physics behind Flash
•	The Different types of Flash (Server, Hybrid and Storage)
•	How to leverage Flash to get the most out of SQL Server
