## Title: SSIS 2014: Project Deployment  Configuration using SSIS Catalog
## Abstract:
### Are you an ETL Developer that has worked with SSIS 2008 or earlier? If so, you will be excited to learn about some of the new features in SSIS 2012 that make your life a lot easier! In this demo-driven session, we will go through the entire process of building, configuring, deploying, executing and reporting on SSIS packages using the Project Deployment Model. You will see how multiple packages are deployed at one time, how project parameters make configuring your packages a breeze, how environment variables help you move your packages from DEV to UAT to PROD, how project level connection managers help you share connections across packages, and Integration Services Dashboard gives you detailed logging so you can identify the cause of package failure with no extra coding.

By the end of this session, you will be ready to start taking advantage of these new features in your own environment.
