## Title: Introduction to MSSQL Server 2008 R2 StreamInsight
## Abstract:
### Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one of the emerging architecture styles in distributed systems. Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 includes an exciting new platform called StreamInsight for building rich data processing over real-time event streams. This technology is ideal for applications that need to process high volumes of event stream data with no latency. Additionally, StreamInsight allows developers to create applications that execute continuous queries over a stream of data.
