## Speaker: Greg Low
## Title: Why compression matters so much for SQL Server and BI
## Abstract:
### When you want to get good performance from your database applications, compression is one of the most important technologies that you need to consider, yet it's one of the least understood. In this session Greg will show the evolution of compression technologies from table compression in SQL Server 2008, to columnstore and tabular data models in SQL Server 2012, through to clustered updatable columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2014.
