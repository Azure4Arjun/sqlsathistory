## Title: Translating your Excel Skills to Power BI
## Abstract:
### The corporate world has depended on Excel to massage and built reports for years. With the accelerated growth of Power BI, professionals are now looking to expand upon their knowledge of Microsoft Excel and enable themselves to start building interactive visuals.

Power BI is a business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft designed for business users who are already familiar with Excel. It’s specifically designed to create interactive dashboards and reports using data from a variety of sources to be published and shared across organizations.

Benefits of Power BI over Excel:
•	Easily share visualizations with your department and/or organization
•	Mobile friendly visualizations
•	Improved visualizations 
•	Accelerated development cycle with monthly updates
•	Combine and work with data in multiple sources or workbooks
