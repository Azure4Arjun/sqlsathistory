## Title: Beyond image classification - object detection  with multi-task deep models
## Abstract:
### Object detection can be challenging to understand, mostly because there is a gap in the literature between image classification and object detection â€” the former is explained in deluge of easy to understand blog posts and articles, the latter is the subject of research papers, full of scary looking math.
In this session we will take different approach and built state of the art object detection model in easy to understand steps. First, we are going to make sure that everybody understand concepts of convolution networks, the importance of  model architecture and loss function. 
Then we are going to build a model that will classify single object, a model that finds this object on a picture, and a model that combine both and is able to classify and localize the largest object in each image.
Finally, we will move to multiple objects detection, discus latest architectures and design appropriate loss function for this task. All this illustrated with examples built using fastai library.
