## Title: Reduce your DBA ( DEV) task list by using Microsoft BI tools
## Abstract:
### Are you a DBA or DBA Dev with access to the Microsoft BI Stack? Why not utilize some of these amazing tools to make your life a little easier?

Are you working without fancy monitoring and reporting tools? Do you dream of having time to pull data into Excel ans show you management staff what is going on? Do you run queries to answer questions for projects or at the department's request on a regular basis? Wanna know what is going on with your report server? 

Come to this "BI for the Engine Guy" session and let me help you make visualizations for all your engine's health care needs and your user's (customer) data demands.
