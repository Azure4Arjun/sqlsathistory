## Title: Database unit testing
## Abstract:
### Unit testing is a good practice to follow also in a database development environment. It allows to realize and finalize the Continuous Integration process on our database and It makes all the development more reliable and consistent just before deployment. We can use some interesting frameworks when testing, and we will speak about installing and executing them.
