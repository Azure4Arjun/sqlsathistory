# SQLSaturday #673 - Denver 2017
Event Date: 16-09-2017 - Session time: 10:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Bill Fellows
## Title: Metadata driven development
## Abstract:
### The longer I've been coding, the less time I want to spend coding - at least, the boring, repetitious bits. In this talk, I'll share the approaches I've used to systematically generate SQL artifacts based on metadata and templates. 

The approach is basic: Get data. Process through some templating engine. Collect output.

The specifics scenarios we'll cover
* Biml/C#: we'll build SSIS packages, tables and stored procedures
* Python: we'll use pyratemp to build tables and CLR stored functions
* Versioning: Version your templates and your data
