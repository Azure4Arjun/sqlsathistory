## Title: SQL - External Data Source for SharePoint  Office
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will examine how to create connections to an external data source (SQL Server) using SharePoint Designer.  Once the External Data Content Type exists, we can display and manipulate the data within SharePoint using an External List.  But you will see in this session that you can also surface the data to Outlook and use the data in a disconnected mode.  You will also see how to use external data sources within a Word document template with the assistance of QuickParts.  The final demonstration (time permitting) shows how you can use the external data in an InfoPath form.
