## Title: Liberate Your Data with Visualisation  Conversation!
## Abstract:
### Modern enterprises today collect more data than cumulatively any other time in history.  This creates both complex challenges yet offers unique opportunities.  How can you aggregate and make sense of this data?  How can you engage with and present relevant data to business without being overwhelming?  In this session weâ€™ll explore data storytelling, and demonstrate some fun and interesting ways to work with data in the Azure Cloud using Power BI, Bots and Cognitive Services that helps expose relevant data in consumable ways.
