## Title: Accelerated BI Growth with Power View  PowerPivot
## Abstract:
### It is a known fact that a low rate of user adoption is a major issue in less than successful BI implementations. The most significant cause could arguably be the lack of simple, intuitive and flexible tools at the reporting/presentation layer. With PowerPivot, Microsoft gave us an easy way to mash-up data models, create Excel reports and surface them through Sharepoint.Now, with Power View in SQL 2012 we have an easy, sexy and compelling way for true business users visualise and present this information. With interactive demos you will learn about Power View, understand its dependencies, learn data model design tips and be made aware of any pitfalls and limitations.
