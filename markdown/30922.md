## Title: Encrypting SSIS Connection String - MINI
## Abstract:
### When storing SSIS connection strings using SQL accounts in a database, how do you keep the passwords secure?  One method is to encrypt the column in the table SSIS Configurations are stored in  present that table to your users as a view with built-in logic to either show or obscure the password data based on their role.  This session will take you through a complete solution, including code to encrypt or not based on whether a password is present.
