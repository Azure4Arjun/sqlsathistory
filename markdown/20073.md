## Title: Conquering ETL Projects
## Abstract:
### Few projects in Information Technology are as fraught with danger as data migration / ETL projects. With the lifeâ€™s blood of the organization on the line ( the data ), these projects require strategies for success that are beyond just the code. After conquering successful data migration and merger projects, and surviving failed projects as well, I will present the life cycle of an ETL project, with strategies for handling the specifics of each phase. I will also share a battle hardened methodology for transforming and merging data with multiple key conflicts, and resolving overloaded fields.
