## Title: Power BI Development Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Are you a developer or analyst, creating Power BI reports that will be shared across teams or even your entire organization?

In this session we will take a brief look at all of the considerations and best practices when developing Power BI models, reports and dashboards.
