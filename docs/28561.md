## Title: Practical Performance Monitoring in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you know what counters, statistics, events and other information you should be collecting on a regular basis to properly monitor your SQL Server instances? Do you know where your current bottlenecks really are or how to even look for them. In this session we will cover the basics when it comes to monitoring the database, server and hardware that give us the biggest bang for the buck. See how a little bit of effort upfront can lead to a much better understanding of your database environment and put you in a position to spot potential issues before they become real trouble.
