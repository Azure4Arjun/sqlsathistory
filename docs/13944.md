## Title: DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous
## Abstract:
### There are many DBCC statements at the disposal of Database Administrators and Developers. Some are used for the greater good; others can wreak havoc in your system. The majority of these commands are informational, but if youâ€™re not careful you can introduce chaos or at worst, lose data you may never find again. In this session we will explore DBCC commands that are useful for the DBA and developer, and cover when to use them and how. Expect demonstrations that provide a practical application of these commands - both documented and not - that database professionals can utilize quickly and easily.
