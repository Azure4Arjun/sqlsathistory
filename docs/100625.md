## Title: Creating Data Tools and Products at the LDH Office of Public Health
## Abstract:
### The Louisiana Department of Health provides a wide range of services to promote and protect the health of people living in Louisiana. The LDH Office of Public Health – Bureau of Health Informatics uses a variety of tools to perform data exploration, conduct data analysis, construct data tools, and create dashboards to help meet the goal of monitoring and improving health. In this session, you’ll see how we use these tools to study data and present public-facing information on topics such as social determinants of health, the opioid epidemic, and the treatment of Hepatitis C. Along the way, we’ll look at mapping in Tableau and how to build a Tableau dashboard embedded in a web page.
