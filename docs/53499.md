## Title: Analysing your online presence using Power BI
## Abstract:
### In this session we will look at how you can use Power BI to analyse you companyâ€™s online presence. 

We will look at how you can source data from Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and finally from web pages. We will then show how you can work with the data to get some meaningful analysis from it and ask the question: Can you get a holistic view of your online presence?

This is a demo rich session where we will go through getting the data in and looking through how we can extend the model using DAX to get more insight before visualizing the results. 

The participants will leave the session with ideas on how they can use Power BI (or indeed some other BI tool) to start analyzing their company#39;s online presence plus the pbix file used in the session with all the code.
