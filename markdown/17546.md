## Title: An Introduction to FileTables
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2012 Microsoft introduced FileTables, a better way to store large objects inside a database. With FileTables you get the advantage of the security and transactional consistency of a database AND improved file streaming from the OS. In this session I'll show you how easy it is to set up and use FileTables, as well as improved methods of searching document keywords with FullText and Semantic searches.
