## Speaker: Rohn Edwards
## Title: Advanced PowerShell Database Reporting Tools (for Beginners)
## Abstract:
### In this session, you'll learn how to use an open source PowerShell module to create advanced PowerShell commands that generate dynamic SQL queries without having to actually know PowerShell. You'll learn how to start with a SQL query and build a fully functioning advanced PowerShell function, complete with parameters that allow for result filtering, PowerShell help, tab completion, and custom formatting, all without having to know how to do any of that in PowerShell. You'll learn how creating these cheap, yet powerful, commands allows you to build entire modules that can be distributed to other users that need to access this data that might not know how to build their own queries.
