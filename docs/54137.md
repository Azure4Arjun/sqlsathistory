## Title: Makin’ Data with Azure Data Factory
## Abstract:
### What’s Data Factory?  Isn’t it just SSIS in the cloud? If you’re an ETL developer or looking for solutions to efficiently integrate your on-prem. data with Azure then you should know what Data Factory is.  Over the last 20 years I’ve worked with BCP, DTS, SSIS, and now Data Factory.  We’ll talk about when and how to use Data Factory.  I’ll demo using Data Factory to pull data from on-prem. sources, transform it, and land it in Azure SQL DB.
