## Title: Make Your Queries Fly With Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you want to speed up your reports over your large tables by 10, 20 or even 50x? Those are the performance improvements that Columnstore indexes can give you – when used properly.
Often touted as a “BI” feature, in reality columnstore indexes can benefit any workload that involves some sort of reporting on large tables. In this session, we’ll first discuss how columnstore indexes work. Once past the basics, we’ll dive in and get dirty, looking at how to rewrite existing queries and change database designs to get the most out of this new index type.
If you are running SQL Server 2012, you can add a columnstore index to your large tables and gain maybe 4x performance – or you can attend this session and make things really fly.
