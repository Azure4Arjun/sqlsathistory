## Title: Tips and Tricks for Auditing in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2005 and later continued to introduce tools to help you audit what was occurring in your database, with 2012 introducing even more auditing tools.  In this session, we'll go over the questions you need to ask your business to determine what level of auditing is appropriate.  We'll go through how to set up many of the common audits to meet your business' requirements.   Each technique has its features and each has associated costs - your goal is to find a balance.
