## Title: Getting in Sync With The Developer Next To You
## Abstract:
### Using everyday tools, some free and some paid, you and the developers working with you might begin to feel out of sync in your efforts, over time. In this session, we'll review both tools and some suggested guidelines to help close the gap between today and where you want to be with the developers around you, whether that's immediate and technical or longer term and relational, or both.
