## Speaker: Ben Emmett
## Title: Entity Framework for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Entity Framework doesn't have the best reputation amongst DBAs, but the good news is it isn't inherently terrible; it's just very easy to get wrong.

In this session, we'll explore the mistakes which make Entity Framework stress SQL Server, and show how you can resolve them. We'll talk about how you can spot issues, either in production environments or during development. Finally we'll discuss ways of working with your development team to prevent these problems occurring in the first place.

You might not leave convinced that Entity Framework is a good idea, but you should go home with the understanding needed to get it running well on your systems.
