## Title: Single Page Applications (SPAs) in SharePoint with Angular
## Abstract:
### The Angular framework allows developers to create lightweight single page web applications with ease. By leveraging the Angular framework and the SharePoint 2013 REST API, we can create lightweight applications within SharePoint as alternatives to InfoPath forms and OOTB SharePoint web parts. This presentation will cover the basics of single page applications with Angular as well as targeting the SharePoint platform with SPA applications.
