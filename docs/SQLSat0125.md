## Speaker: Carlos Bossy
## Title: Real-time Data Warehouse and Reporting Solutions
## Abstract:
### In this demo-rich session, we will explore database and ETL architectures that let you smoothly move data from your application databases across the enterprise in real-time to your data warehouse. You will see how to use SQL Server features such as replication, Change Data Capture, SSIS, and other techniques to extract, transform, and load data fast and dependably. We will develop an actual sample system during the session and discuss and walk through alternative real-time architectures, including the use of Data Vault methodologies. We will then see how to use Reporting Services and Power View to present data with a minimum amount of latency.

# Instant Scale, High Avail.  Performance for SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-125)
Event Date: 25-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Corey Brune
## Title: Instant Scale, High Avail.  Performance for SQL
## Abstract:
### Achieving scale-out quickly and easily for MS SQL Server environments can be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Other areas that are difficult or costly to achieve for SQL Server environments include transparent caching of Read queries, as well as instrumentation and Analytics of all SQL queries in *real-time*.  In this session, you will learn how ScaleArc has developed SQL Server infrastructure software that achieves instant scale-out, caching, load balancing, firewall/filtering and higher availability…without any changes or modifications to existing applications or SQL Server databases.  For those interested in migrating to SQL Server 2012, we will also discuss how ScaleArc can assist and add-value in a 2012 migration.

Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool.

# Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware

Event Date: 25-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Bonus
## Speaker: Kathy  Gibbs
## Title: Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware
## Abstract:
### SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.

#### [Back to calendar](#nr-125)

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: SSAS 2012 Tabular vs. Multidimensional            
## Abstract:
### The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.

# Performance Analysis – Finding What Needs Tuning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-125)
Event Date: 25-08-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Developer
## Speaker: Mike Hotek
## Title: Performance Analysis – Finding What Needs Tuning
## Abstract:
### Everyone wants to tell you WHAT to do when you have a performance problem.  Of course, the bigger issue is in determining what the actual performance problem is before you can apply the correct solution to the correct problem.  Most of those same people producing the cookbooks will also tell you that performance analysis is an “art form” – code-speak for “you need to hire me and spend a lot of money”.  This session will blow away the myth of “it’s an art form” and show you how to apply the tools you already know how to use coupled with some basic understanding of a database engine and use that to find the actual problems with enough time to spare so that you can actually fix them.

## Speaker: Mike Hotek
## Title: Fixing SQL Server–Complete Mess 2 Smooth Operation
## Abstract:
### You’ve either been there or have walked into one and I certainly hope it isn’t your current environment.  There are SQL Server environments which quite simply do not work.  The business doesn’t trust the data, people are running around playing whack-a-mole, everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else, and the tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  When everything is failing, how do you figure out where to start so that you can build a foundation to work from?  How do you then build on that foundation to systematically fix all of the problems while still being home for dinner every night?  Join us for this real world look at “you’re the DBA, you own it, and you fix it”.
