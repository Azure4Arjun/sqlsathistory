## Title: DataExplorer - the reason you might not need SQL Server 
## Abstract:
### The DataExplorer plugin for Excel( which is currently in preview) is targeting Excel users and Business Analysts by providing them a homegrown ETL process without any additional Servers. Powered by the flexibility of the "M" language, DataExplorer is capable reaching out for such diverse sources as OData, File System, HDInsight or Facebook, for example. 
Besides providing an accessible interface for the non-IT people, the real potential behind DataExplorer lies in creating customizable functions and processes far beyond any GUI.
