## Title: The Fangorn Forest - ColumnStore Indexes
## Abstract:
### In the fantasy world of Middle-earth live the Ents. The Ents are tall tree-people who help the Fellowship by parallelizing the fight against Saruman. Come and learn how the new SQL 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations in the same way. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes.If you are a production DBA who needs to find out about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments or if you are a BI developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is for you.
