## Title: Boost your analytical superpowers with spatial data
## Abstract:
### Analyzing huge sets of data isn't something humans are made for. Humans are more suitable for making decisions based on things they can see. So how do you bring that into the business? One of the options you have is to visualize some of your (location based) data on maps. A feature for this in SQL Server is called spatial data (geo data). By using physical locations and shapes to visualize data, you can quickly analyze big sets of data.

In this session, we're going to take a look at how spatial data works, how you can query it, and how to use it to leverage your decision making process.
