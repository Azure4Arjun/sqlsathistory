## Title: TempDB  behind the scenes
## Abstract:
### In this session, I’ll talk about the difference in logging of tempdb in compression to other databases.   I’ll talk about the differences between temporary tables and table variables.  Run demos that show why many of the information that can be found on the internet about table variables is simply wrong.  Show some errors that are done when working with temporary tables that cause performance issues.
