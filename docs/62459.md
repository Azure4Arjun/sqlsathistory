## Speaker: Bob Duffy
## Title: Complex Tabular Modelling - A Case Study
## Abstract:
### While building of Tabular Models may be straight forward it rapidly becomes more complex when you steer off-piste and into more complex design pattern such as:
- Non Star Schema Data Warehouses 
- Many to Many/Parent Child/Versioned relationships
- DAX Calculations: semi additive and various flavours of last non empty.
- Events in Progress
- Versioned Fact Tables
- XML Fact Tables
- Real Time update requirements

This one hour session will walk through an actual case study of a tabular model and discuss the pain points we encountered on the way, along with solutions and workarounds.
