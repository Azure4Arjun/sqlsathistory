## Title: Extending Your Data Warehouse With PolyBase and Hadoop
## Abstract:
### Introduced with Microsoft's Analytics Platform System (APS), PolyBase provides first tier support for accessing and incorporating data from Hadoop platforms in APS.  But, what does that mean to the data warehouse?  What changes because you can easily integrate APS into a Hadoop environment?  Join me in this session to look at the ways data warehouses evolve when you extend your solutions into PolyBase and Hadoop.
•             Extend your data warehouse to Hadoop and the Azure cloud
•             Save of costs and efforts when archiving data warehouse data
•             Leverage new technologies with existing solutions
