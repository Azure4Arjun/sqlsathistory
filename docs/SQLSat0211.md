# Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#211-Chicago-2013)
Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events
## Abstract:
### If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.

# Demystifying Database Statistics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#211-Chicago-2013)
Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Demystifying Database Statistics
## Abstract:
### Database statistics are not made up numbers, like the statistics you may hear on TV or read in a news article. They are critical metadata used by SQL Server’s query optimizer. In this session, we will look at statistics from the ground up and remove the mystery that surrounds them. Demos and real-world examples will be used to explain what statistics are, why you should care about them, and what you can control. 

By the end of the session, you will understand: 
• How to view statistics and interpret the histogram 
• How and when to update statistics 
• How statistics affect the query optimizer 
• When you can let SQL Server manage statistics, and when you need to step in

# Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#211-Chicago-2013)
Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 5
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables
## Abstract:
### Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.

# Monitoring and collecting storage info for DBAs
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#211-Chicago-2013)
Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 6
## Speaker: Haidong Ji
## Title: Monitoring and collecting storage info for DBAs
## Abstract:
### As an admin, we need to keep an eye on storage: What is the total size and available size on disk devices? What about mount points? How much space does each database take? What about breaking that down into schemas, tables, data size, and index size? Granted, some of that can be seen through Management Studio reports, but what if we want to keep a historical record of all that for planning and trending purposes? What if we are on a tight budget and cannot afford monitoring software.

In this session, I will explain and demo a PowerShell/SQL Server combo solution that is simple, elegant, and works! You will come away with code and instructions on how to implement it.

Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: What Are You Waiting For?
## Abstract:
### You’ve spent the afternoon sweating over your T-SQL query. You’ve wrung out all of the wrinkles. It’s deployed, it’s running… now its waiting. In SQL Server the most performant query can become a problem query if there aren’t any resources in the SQL Server for it to use. In this session, we’ll look at wait statistics and what they are. We’ll look into how they are accumulated and how they can be monitored. By the end of the session, you’ll be equipped with the tools needed to determine if there are resource issues in your environment and methods to start mitigating them.

# Discovering the Plan Cache
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#211-Chicago-2013)
Event Date: 13-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL 
## Abstract:
### Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!

## Speaker: Rick Krueger
## Title: Rules of Engagement: NoSQL is SQL Server's Ally
## Abstract:
### When should you favor a NoSQL store over SQL Server, or consider polyglot persistence? In military and police operations, the rules of engagement determine when, where, and how force shall be used. As the “data police”, we are responsible for determining when, where, and how data is stored. As SQL Server professionals, it tends to be our first choice, even when there are other data storage options that are a ‘more natural’ fit. In this session, Rick and Dave will start with the NoSQL basics, and then dive into the different categories of NoSQL stores while explaining what each type is well suited for.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
## Abstract:
### Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Title: Database Unit Testing made Easy
## Abstract:
### Though most developers agree that unit testing plays an important role in software development, to ensure quality  meet milestones, most developers write unit tests only as an afterthought. VSTS helps to mainstream Test Driven Development methodology (TDD) into world of database development. In this session, we will not only cover the basis of unit testing concepts and terminology, but also discuss how unit testing helps ensure and document the quality and accuracy of database deliverables. We will run through a demo of creating and running database unit tests using VSTS 2012, as well as upgrading from VSTS2010 database and unit test projects.

## Speaker: Luke Jian
## Title: Anatomy of a Join
## Abstract:
### A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.
