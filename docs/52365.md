## Title: Practical Transactional Log Fundamentals for the DBA
## Abstract:
### The transaction logging system lies at the heart of SQL Server, but many DBAs do not understand its inner workings very well.  In this session, we will examine the purpose and organization of the transaction log and will explore the log through a unique visualization tool.  We will consider common performance issues that are related to the logging mechanism and how to overcome these problems.  Finally, we will discuss some techniques to monitor the log so that potential performance problems can be addressed pro-actively.
