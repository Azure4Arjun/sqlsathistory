## Title: It's broken, now what? (Approaches to Practical Problem Solving)
## Abstract:
### We've all experienced weird situations in IT - things break without any real apparent reason. Sometimes, error messages can be helpful, but mostly they are cryptic and lead to no real explanations/solutions.

In this session, I will show a few ways to approach problem solving in a practical and concise manner. Using real-world scenarios that I have run into in the past I will explain how I approached each issue. Sometimes by finding simple solutions, but sometimes having to be creative and employ methods that may not be so intuitive.

You will leave the session with a better understanding on how to approach solving any technical issues you experience at work.
