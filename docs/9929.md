## Title: Intro to SharePoint BI

### Microsoft SharePoint is a collaboration software that provides a web based portal for business intelligence, content management and document sharing. In this session we start with an overview of the basics by sharing a SQL table as a 'List' using Sharepoint and SSIS. Next we move on to fun stuff of integrating SQL Server Reporting Services integration. Finally we look at how to give users dynamic PowerPivot analysis in a dashboard.
