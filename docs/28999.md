## Title: Build Your Own SQL Server Private Cloud
## Abstract:
### Do you know what SaaS and DaaS are? If not, you should. SQL Server as a service (SaaS) and database as a service (DaaS) are otherwise known as the private cloud â€“ the ability to offer your customers (external or internal) a reliable, scalable, and manageable way to easily deploy SQL Server systems and databases. At the end of the day they essentially want to push a button and get what they asked for. This is what the private cloud experience should enable for them. While you may do some of this now, come learn how to take it to the next level and design a service offering that will enable your organization to be agile, yet not leave you tearing out your hair worrying about it.
