## Title: SQL Server Amnesia
## Abstract:
### Losing your memory is never fun.  Well, I can't help you with that, but I can help show you how SQL Server is using its memory and some things to look at with regards to performance problems.

When I started as a DBA I didn't know much about SQL Server internals.  I inheirited quite a few servers and they were experiencing performance problems.  Over time I learned more about the internals and how to troubleshoot systems.  I'll share some stories with you and talk about some of the methods I use to look at how SQL Server is using its memory.  Then we'll look at some examples and demo code.
