## Speaker: Jeff Prom
## Title: Master Data Services
## Abstract:
### Does your company have similar data in multiple locations? Not really sure which set of data is accurate? With MDS, Microsoft gives you the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data to use with your applications or send to other databases and ETL processes. Leverage data stewards to help manage the data repository to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.

In this session we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel 
add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this session, you should have a good understanding of what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.
