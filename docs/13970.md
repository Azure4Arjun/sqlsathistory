## Speaker: Eric Wise
## Title: Building a Better Development Shop
## Abstract:
### In a world where “every company is becoming a software company”, building and managing a software development team that can consistently deliver value is a key concern for hiring managers and executives.  In this presentation we cover the key qualities of good software, discuss research showing why hiring great developers pays big dividends, explore why your hiring process sucks, and cover common traits of high performing teams, and more importantly things in your environment that drive great developers away.  Bonus: Most of the recommendations are inexpensive!
