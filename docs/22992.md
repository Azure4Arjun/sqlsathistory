## Title: Temporary Objects Without Permanent Consequences
## Abstract:
### Temporary objects like Table Variables and Temporary Tables are not inherently bad, but they are overused and misunderstood by many. Increase your understanding and learn when you should favor a Temporary Table over a Table Variable. We will start with the basics, but also look at execution plans to get a better grasp on the cause of those performance differences. Table-Valued Parameters are implemented as read-only Temporary Tables under the covers, and have some solid use cases. Discover how Table-Valued Parameters can be used to: 1) avoid the dynamic sql used by application code (or t-sql string splitting functions) to allow multi-value selection and 2) dramatically reduce the number of round trips between an application and SQL Server.
