In this session Tim Radney will cover several methods for performing much needed backups and how to recover those backups.  Full, Differential, File Group, Transaction logs and recovery the tail end of a the log.  He will discuss industry best practices and hopefully cause you to validate and test your current strategy.

## Title:  Pro Tips:  Performance Tuning SSIS
## Abstract:
### Synchronous and asynchronous components, memory buffers, data type choices. Tuning the data flow is all about choices. In this session we'll explore some of the choices that can give you the biggest performance boosts in your ssis data flow. Together we'll walk through creating a performance baseline, the differences between synchronous and asynchronous components and a few simple patterns we can implement to improve performance in our SSIS packages.

## Title: Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS with Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities, and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs. This is the initial session of a set of detailed Best Practices presentations.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics
## Abstract:
### In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

## Title: Troubleshooting SQL Server with SysInternals Tools
## Abstract:
### In this demo-packed session we will explore the use of SysInternals tools like Process Monitor, Process Explorer, and many others to troubleshoot various problem scenarios with SQL Server. This session is not for the faint of heart and is tailored toward those adventurous DBAs who often like to step out of their comfort zone. A fair knowledge of Windows OS internals is recommended.
