## Title: GET UP AND GO: BIG DATA AUTOMATION USING HDINSIGHT
## Abstract:
### Big Data is the new great tool in the IT Toolbox. There are so many different ways to utilize Big Data in your environment, that’s hard to know what way may be the best for your situation, even if all you want to do is create a Proof of Concept. Microsoft Azure has come to the table with their own cloud offering called HDInsight. In this session, we’ll go over HDInsight, and the differences that exist between it and other Hadoop deployments. We’ll go through the different options for deploying an HDInsight cluster. We’ll also go over using PowerShell for interacting with HDInsight, including scripts that you can use to automate the creation of an HDInsight cluster, run a Pig Script, and downloading your output file from Azure Blob Storage.
