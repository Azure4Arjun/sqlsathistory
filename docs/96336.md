## Title: SQL Server Management Studio - Beyond the basics
## Abstract:
### Almost all of us use SQL Server Management Studio to interact with SQL Server, and thankfully it works right out of the box.  But did you know there are so many tricks and shortcuts that hide just under the surface that can make working with SSMS feel like second nature? 

In this session, I will take a fresh install of SSMS and step through customizing it.  I will demonstrate features and help you become more efficient at utilizing SSMS to it's fullest potential - a lot of the time without using the mouse. Finally, Iâ€™ll show you some cool text editing tricks that will take your SQL skills to a whole new level.
