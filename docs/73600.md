## Title: SQL Graph
## Abstract:
### Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017, and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft products).  Microsoft recently added Graph DB to their DocumentDB (product) and released it as Cosmos DB.  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.
