## Title: What is new in SQL Server 2016 for DBAs?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 was released in June 2016 with tons of new features. When Service Pack 1 was released in November 2016, many of the Enterprise level features were allowed in lower editions of SQL server 2016. Microsoft made sure everyone got something out from an upgrade to SQL Server 2016. In this session, you will get an overview of several of the new features in SQL Server 2016. It will cover Dynamic Data masking, Row Level Security, Always Encrypted, Temporal tables and time permitting few more goodies. This is a high-level overview session on advanced features of SQL Server 2016 and therefore we will not be going deep into any one technology. My goal is to inspire you to take action and play with new features of this great product.
