## Title: Searching Binary Data in SQL Server 2012
## Abstract:
### More and more data collected in organizations is in an encoded format, essentially a binary classification of data. These can be images, audio files, video, or even common formats like Word and Excel files. This data contains lots of important data, but the formatting must be stripped out in order for users to effectively search this data. Filestream, Filetable, Full-Text Search, and Semantic Search are covered.
