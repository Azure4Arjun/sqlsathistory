## Title: Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations
## Abstract:
### Any changes to Non-Memory Optimized tables require a certain amount of logging to the transaction log in order to ensure the integrity of the operation and of course the data. Most of these are fully logged operations and can write a tremendous amount of data to the transaction log. As you probably already know this can lead to various performance and availability issues. However you may be able to minimize the effect of these with what is called a minimally logged operation. This session will outline how these can be used under the right conditions to save time, resources and potentially a lot of headaches. Various demos will hit home on just how much of an impact this can have on some every day operations.
