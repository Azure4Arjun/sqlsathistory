## Title: Data Compression – Why and How
## Abstract:
### SQL Server’s index compression can have substantial benefits for administration, resource utilization, and query performance.  However, implementing compression can be challenging.  This session will discuss the benefits of compression, some occasional costs to be aware of, and then provide scripts to estimate compression benefits for indices, as well as generate the SQL needed to implement compression for those indices that warrant it.
