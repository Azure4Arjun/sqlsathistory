## Title: Using Extended Events to Build a Login Cube
## Abstract:
### Using Extended Events, Powershell, TSQL, MDX and Excel we will build a SSAS MD Cube that allows
you to track SQL Server Logins  that can be slices and diced per Hour, Server, User, Host, Connection String and Database.

This session touches on multiple advanced topics that you can use individually, but together, make for a powerful SQL Security Auditing Tool not found anywhere else. Includes downloadable source code.
