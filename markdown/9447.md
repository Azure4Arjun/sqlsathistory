## Title: Geocoding with SQL Server, Bing and Google Maps API
## Abstract:
### Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). 
Geographic coordinates can then be converted into SQL Server spatial data type and stored in a database. 
In this session we will learn: 
- how to retrieve coordinates from an address, using Google Maps API and Bing API;
- how to get a free license from API services; 
- how to automate the process and convert coordinates into a geography data type using SQL Server Integration Services;
- how to store the data into a database.
