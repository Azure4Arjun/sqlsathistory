## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: Data Driven Organisation: Machine Learning as part of an organisation's DNA
## Abstract:
### The session explores how organisations are using machine learning techniques to deliver agile analytics as they become a data-driven organisation's DNA.
How it is possible to imprint data-driven analytical thinking into the culture of the organization? Is Machine Learning viable for everyone? Analytics platforms have always been tools built for statisticians and data scientists. However, these tools are increasingly being directed at business analysts, and Gartner's rankings on its well-known "completeness of vision" and "ability to execute" axes now rest as much on "ease of use" as they do on offering advanced analytical algorithms.
Machine learning focuses the emphasis on the insights and value that data brings, and it is now accessible to organisations. 

This session will help you to:

- understand how to craft an ML strategy
- provision the right business analytical capabilities
- move towards actionable results
- identify common pitfalls
