## Title: Hardware for Nothing, Get Your Flash for Free
## Abstract:
### By now, Tier 1 apps deployed on flash is ubiquitous.  However, Tier 2 apps often remain relegated to spinning media.  This presentation explains the economics of consolidating on flash.  Owing to the SQL Server core licensing model, licensing a 2-socket commodity server can cost up to $500,000 or more!  Consolidating instances on flash can—and does—save hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  This presentation provides real-life case studies showing such real-life savings.
