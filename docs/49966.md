## Title: Copy Data Management and Virtualization
## Abstract:
### As DBAs, Developers, Infrastructure professionals, CIOs and IT Directors we are straddled with multiple issues pertaining to Copy Data sprawl. 

Just imagine, it is 4:30 PM on Friday evening, you need a 10 TB database restored, thirty minutes after restore is complete, you are asked to do it again. What can you do?
In any conventional method for providing copy data, you would run into any or all of the issues of providing space, bandwidth consumption, time to complete, the lead time to complete, security, masking and the key question "Which server does this go to"?

We will also discuss the pros and cons of methods that are currently used for copy data including replication, mirroring, transaction log shipping, block level replication etc.  We will learn about "Copy Data Virtualization" a relatively new concept; and how it can help us overcome all these issues. 
We will examine what technologies/products are available that help us mitigate such a massive problem of Copy Data.
