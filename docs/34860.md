Event Date: 25-04-2015 - Session time: 11:45:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Richard Douglas
## Title: Top Down Tuning
## Abstract:
### Lots of emphasis is placed upon fixing long running queries and reports, but what if you’re running third party applications, what then? In this session Richard Douglas will walk you through a number of options and procedures you should be following to allow your SQL Server to run more optimally. This is “Top Down Tuning” where the emphasis is placed on how you can make things better for all your users rather than SELECT TOP 3 Users FROM dbo.Company ORDER BY Importance DESC (That’s T-SQL for a selected few).
