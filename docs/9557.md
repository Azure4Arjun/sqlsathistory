## Title: Powershell for the Enterprise
## Abstract:
### Got Powershell?  In today's budget tight organizations they want technical administrators to do more with less.  If you're a DBA and you're NOT using Powershell, you could be missing out on the milk.  In this session, we'll go beyond the simple get commands and learn how to put those results into useful tools like monitoring SQL jobs, disk space, service accounts and put those into a database for future analysis.  Learn how to use the true POWER in Powershell.
