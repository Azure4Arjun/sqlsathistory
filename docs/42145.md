## Title: Adding another Dimension type to SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will focus in on how we can use temporal tables, along with a Stretch table, to provide an alternative solution to Type 2 Dimensions and archiving data with SQL Server 2016 and Azure DB. We will cover an overview of each technology, feature setup/install, compatibility with other SQL Server 2016 features, wait types and how to monitor these two important features.
