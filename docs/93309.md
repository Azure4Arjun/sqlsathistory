## Title: What the Hekaton?!
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Hekaton, aka In-Memory OLTP, will completely change the way you think about data management. As a DBA, you’ll need to analyze your memory and storage needs completely differently. In this session, I will show you the in-memory architecture for your Hekaton data and indexes, and discuss what gets written to disk during checkpoints, as well as what gets logged. Finally, I’ll go into detail on just what it is that makes Hekaton so much FASTER!
