## Title: Data Security in Power BI
## Abstract:
### As more enterprises adopt Power BI into their BI environment, questions still remain about data security when working with the Power BI Service. During this webinar, we will handle a number of these concerns and point out shortcomings that still exist. How does Power BI Premium impact security? (Hint: Itâ€™ not just about licensing). We will also take a closer look at auditing, App Workspaces, and Power BI Apps during this session. 

Due to the frequent changes to Power BI, improvements to data security are common within the platform as it matures. We will discuss data security and compliance within the platform including data classification, privacy levels, and other settings which help to manage your data security.
