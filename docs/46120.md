## Title: Migrating SQL Server Quickly and Effectively
## Abstract:
### Have you ever had to migrate a SQL Server Instance from one server to another? Are you a 24/7 shop with a strict maintenance window? Have you ever been asked to migrate 100's of databases in a matter of minutes to keep the outage as short as possible?

In this session we will look at some techniques that can be used to migrate your SQL instances from one server to another using tools included with SQL Server. We will discuss how these strategies can be used to keep your down time requirements to a minimum and measured in minutes rather than hours.
