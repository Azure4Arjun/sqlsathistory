## Title: In Memory OLTP: One programmer's experience 
## Abstract:
### New for SQL Server 2014, In Memory OLTP, aka Hekaton, improves performance of many OLTP operations by maintaining tables in memory in lock  latch free data structures and compiling T-SQL stored procedures to native code.  This is one programmer’s experience porting an application to SQL Server 2014’s In-Memory OLTP feature to improve application concurrency, performance and scalability.  I will discuss lessons learned and what changes are necessary to partially migrate an existing application to exploit SQL Server In Memory OLTP without having to rewrite a large application.
