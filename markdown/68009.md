## Speaker: Greg Moore
## Title: Presently Presenting.... Presenting
## Abstract:
### So you've decided to take the leap into presenting. Maybe it's at your local user group, maybe it's at SQL Saturday.
This talk will guide you through the process of selecting a topic, preparing for it and actually giving it.

We'll talk about what can go wrong and how to handle that.
We'll also talk about what can be done to prevent something from going wrong in the first place.

What are some good guidelines to follow and when can, or even should, you break them.

This will be partly interactive so come with questions and be prepared to be asked some.
