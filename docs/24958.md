## Title: Forward the Federations
## Abstract:
### If you are working with Windows Azure SQL Database (WASD) then you know that the way to scale large data sets is to use federations.

I'll give the steps you need to set up federations in your WASD database and how to use SSIS to fill the tables with data.
