## Title: SQL Server Performance Tuning - Parallelism 
## Abstract:
### During query optimization, SQL Server is looking for queries or index operations that might benefit from parallel execution. This session will give you a better understanding of parallelism in SQL Server. The default server configurations are no longer enough for controlling parallelism, as a DBA, you need to know how to tweak the settings to make it run optimally. When parallelism goes wrong, it can cause performance problems to SQL Server. Sometimes only for a particular query, sometimes it can hurt performance server-wide. What is best practices to MAXDOP.
