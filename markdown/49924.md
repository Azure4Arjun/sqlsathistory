## Speaker: Mark Wojciechowicz
## Title: Extending PowerBI
## Abstract:
### This will be a Co-presentation with Ed Bunt and Mark Wojciechowicz.

With PowerBI, we can easily create intuitive reports and dashboards.  This highly customizable environment can be extended in many ways, even outside its own environment.  In this session, we will look at how to create a custom visual, how to embed PowerBI in a custom application, how to integrate PowerBI with Cortana in windows 10, and, if we can think of anything else before June, weâ€™ll do that too.
