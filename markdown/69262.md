## Title: Running applications on Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL
## Abstract:
### Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL are managed database services built for developers using the community edition of MySQL and PostgreSQL. Learn how you can leverage these new choices of managed database services to build scalable, secure and intelligent apps. Using insights from current customer scenarios and through live demos, we walk through the service management capabilities, best practices to move your databases to the service, and also focus on how the Microsoft Azure ecosystem of app and data services is unlocking the potential of MySQL and PostgreSQL in the Azure cloud platform.

In this session, we will show you how you can develop on Azure and deploy solutions without having to worry about high availability, disaster recovery, monitoring and other common operational and administration tasks!
