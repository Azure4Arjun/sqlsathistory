## Title: Information Governance:  Understanding the Risks and Developing Solutions around Unstructured data
## Abstract:
### Organizations are faces with information overload from employee generated unstructured data in the form of emails and electronic documents.    With no idea of the content that exists within these documents or the locations with more and more options being provided for storage of documents,  Organizations are having to come to terms with the liabilities, overhead and management of these resources.      This session looks at the issues of dark data within an organization and methods to understand and combat it.
