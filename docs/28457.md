## Title: Partitioned Tables: Management  Query Processing
## Abstract:
### You are implementing partitioning because you want easier management for very large tables and indexes and want to improve your data loading, deletion and archival operations. But you also need to know the query processing implications and understand how partitioning will impact your existing queries. On the other side, many developers believe that the primary purpose of partitioning is to make your queries run faster. This session will show you the reality and will focus on both how to implement partitioning to achieve better maintenance and data availability and how it will impact query processing, including potential issues, benefits and recommendations.
