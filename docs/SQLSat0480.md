# Cleaning House: The Indexing Edition
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-480)
Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Database Administration 
## Speaker: Andy Yun
## Title: Cleaning House: The Indexing Edition
## Abstract:
### Do you design your database's indexes? Well, have you ever analyzed how those indexes are being used, if at all? And do you know if SQL Server needs other indexes to improve performance? Attend this session and discover how SQL Server tracks actual index usage. We will use this data to identify wasteful, unused,  redundant indexes. Finally, we will dive into the Missing Index DMV and learn how to make proper use of its recommendations. We will spend the second half of this session interactively working through a demo exercise, to reinforce the entire process.

## Speaker: Rushabh Mehta
## Title: Mastering and Enhancing Company Data
## Abstract:
### Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.

# XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-480)
Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Adam Belebczuk
## Title: XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.

# Row-level Security in SSRS and SSAS
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-480)
Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: BI Architecture  Management
## Speaker: Chris Hyde
## Title: Row-level Security in SSRS and SSAS
## Abstract:
### It is relatively straight-forward to grant a user access to a particular SSRS report, multi-dimensional cube, or tabular model table, but what happens when the user needs access to the object but should be denied access to view certain rows of data?  In this session we'll investigate a real-world solution to this common BI problem.

# Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-480)
Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Database  Application Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations
## Abstract:
### OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.

## Speaker: Michael Fal
## Title: Powershell Jumpstart for SQL Server DBAs
## Abstract:
### Powershell can be hard. As a language, it is fairly complex and provides a large array of functionality.  Fortunately, you can teach yourself how to use Powershell with tools that are built right into the language. This session will cover some Powershell fundamentals, how you can use Powershell itself to learn about concepts and syntax, and techniques for using Powershell with SQL Server. We will focus on core language patterns that you can use immediately, taking the mystery out of the code and helping you start writing your own Powershell scripts. The key to learning Powershell is using it and this session will give you a launchpad to start building your own tools.

# Version control with GIT for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-480)
Event Date: 16-01-2016 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Other
## Speaker: Justin Dearing
## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
## Abstract:
### In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.

## Speaker: Dave Fackler
## Title: SSAS Metadata Reporting for Cube Consumers and Developers
## Abstract:
### You've made that big investment in developing several (or hundreds) of SSAS cubes.  Now, how do you provide your users with information regarding cube structures, hierarchies and attributes, measures, etc.?  And what if your cube developers want to know things like which attributes in a model have specific properties set (or not set)?  During this session, we'll explore a reporting solution developed to provide SSAS metadata information to cube consumers and developers alike.  By using SSIS, the AMO object model, and SSRS, we'll build a system that gathers SSAS metadata and makes that available via a set of reports to create a catalog of cubes, drill-down reports showing dimension/hierarchy/attribute information, etc.

## Speaker: Hope Foley
## Title: Don't Rely on Magic - Tabular Performance Troubleshooting 
## Abstract:
### Many times you'll hear that one of the major advantages of using the tabular model is ease of use and implementation.  So that must mean that it will run like a super fast dream all the time out of the box, forever and ever right?  Not exactly.  There are many things to consider at the time of modeling and implementation for performance.  And later if you run into trouble with reports and queries, what do you do then?  In this session we'll go through the process to troubleshoot performance of your tabular models and queries to keep things running as fast as possible.  Just because tabular is easy to use doesn't mean you have a magical black box that you can't tune when it doesn't run as fast as you want.  In this session, we will focus on building a methodology for troubleshooting tabular performance so you can get that super fast dream machine.

## Speaker: Andy Warren
## Title: Automating Database Restores
## Abstract:
### Beginning DBA's think of a RESTORE as something that gets done when something goes wrong. In practice we restore all the time, perhaps most often to refresh our QA and Development environments. Doing one restore isn't hard, but what about when you get five or ten requests a day? It's not just the restore either, you have to alter permissions, change the recovery model, set the database owner, perhaps update synonyms or mask out sensitive data. Restores are a pattern and if we see the pattern, we can do things to make it faster and repeatable.

This presentation will show you the latest version of the system I use, one consisting of a couple of tables and a couple of Powershell scripts. I'll start with my design goals, show you some of the compromises I made to get to a solution that handles 90% or so of the requests, and some of the options I thought about but decided against. I used Powershell, but  it's a pattern you could solve using another language, even perhaps TSQL!

## Title: Turning Requirements into a BI Prototype
## Abstract:
### Your SQL Server system can support two types of Analysis Services models: multidimensional or tabular. But what if you’ve never implemented them and your company wants to start using BI? Are you wondering how to get started? Regardless of which type of SSAS model you want to use, the best first step is to determine what types of questions your BI solution should answer. Next, determine how to structure your data. Before you begin the physical restructuring of your data, though, you should validate your proposed design by creating a prototype that users can review with you. In this session you’ll learn how to translate the business questions to be answered by your solution into a functional prototype that can steer your development efforts in the right direction.

## Speaker: Pat Phelan
## Title: Data Architecture 101
## Abstract:
### This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

NOTE: Database Architecture 101 is like Calculus 101 or Bio-Chemistry 101. This is a very basic introduction to Database Architecture, but it is not intended for the inexperienced Database Administrator.

## Title: Parameter Sniffing and the Query Store in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting performance problem (particularly related to parameter sniffing) is one of the most challenging and most often faced situation in a DBA’s life. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has come up with an Interesting tool called the “Query Store”. The Query Store records everything about query compilations and execution statistics. It collects and presents detailed historic information about all queries in a simplified way and reduces the time required to diagnose and resolve issues faster, even allowing you to observe changes in query performance over time. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the Query Store and discuss its features, benefits, and implementation

## Speaker: Maxwell Myrick
## Title: The Art and the Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server Solution
## Abstract:
### When asked to design a critical database system, too many people pick an HA feature and then design the solution around it. This usually results in a costly and disappointing design. This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way you’ll hear best practices, tips, and real world advice for features like Availability Groups, clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will make you the hero of your next mission critical deployment.

## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!
## Abstract:
### Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!
