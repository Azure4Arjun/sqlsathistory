## Title: Introduction to Microsoft SQL Azure
## Abstract:
### You can't develop software in 2010 without considering the impact of running applications in the cloud instead of your own servers. Microsoft has expanded SQL Server to the cloud with SQL Azure. In this session, we'll take a look at SQL Azure and how to get started with it. We'll cover best practices of developing solutions based around SQL Azure. Finally, we'll cover what features that SQL Azure doesn't have and things that you have to know when developing applications for the Azure platform.
