## Title: Indexes: Everything You Wanted to Know -- Help or Hinder
## Abstract:
### Indexes can be a boon or decrement for query performance. This presentation will present what they are (in layman’s terms) and how they may affect query performance – both from a read (SELECT) viewpoint as well as a data modification aspect (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  This session will concentrate with a deep dive into clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering nonclustered indexes will also be examined in detail and the scenarios they should be applied.  There will be many query demos illustrating index utilization using statistics and query plans.  Attendee should have some TSQL and Management Studio experience.
