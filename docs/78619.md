## Title: Designing a SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups Topology Without Losing Your Sanity
## Abstract:
### So, you’re tasked to implement SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups but don’t know where to start. You have a lot of different topologies to choose from but they’re all the more confusing. Creating effective design architecture is key. In this session, we will look at the different topologies – from simple ones to advance – that you can implement and how to build them. At the end of the session, you will walk away with the knowledge on how to build the right SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group topology that will address your high availability and disaster recovery requirements.

You will learn:

- Common design patterns and guidelines that you need to consider when building your architecture
- Proper selection of quorum configuration
- Network configuration for local and geographically dispersed replicas
- Combining SQL Server Failover Clustering with AlwaysOn Availability Groups
