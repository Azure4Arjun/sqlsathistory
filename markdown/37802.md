## Speaker: Patrick Okeeffe
## Title: Wait Watchers - All Gain No Pain
## Abstract:
### We're all told to watch our weight and to exercise more. Join Dell Software who will show you painless exercises that you can do to watch your waits. You could even eat a Danish pastry while watching if you wish (Danish pastries not provided). 

In this session, you will learn all about SQL Serverâ€™s wait statistics; statistics that the database engine stores about the resources it is waiting on. Armed with this information, SQL Server professionals like you can make better informed decisions on which areas of your environment to tune to ensure greater impact on performance. Join this session to discover where to find, interpret, and use this information to tie down problem areas in your SQL Server environment. This won't be only be about how to fix that problem query, but we'll also talk about how to improve overall performance for all your users.
