## Speaker: Joshua Lynn
## Title: T-SQL Development techniques for performance 
## Abstract:
### Not all SQL performance problems should be solved by throwing more hardware and more indexes at the database.  A better query will always outperform any hardware only solution since a better query will still run faster on better hardware than a poorly written one.  Load your T-SQL development toolbox with tips, tricks, and techniques to make your sloth like database applications dance and sing.
