## Title: Powering Azure from PowerShell
## Abstract:
### Azure is seeing phenominal growth. More and more companies, from large enterprises to small start ups, are taking advantage of Azure to host their IT operations. As an IT Pro, you will be asked to manage all these services. While the Azure Portal is a nice user interface, we all know it simply won't scale in the face of the high demands placed on IT Pros. The solution is obvious: PowerShell! 

In this session you'll be introduced to the PowerShell cmdlets for managing your Azure infrastructure. You'll see how to manage your Azure storage, create virtual machines, and even work with SQL Azure. By the end of this session you'll understand how to use PowerShell to manage the most common Azure tasks.
