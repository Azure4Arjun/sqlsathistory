## Title: Improving DB Development with SQL Source Control
## Abstract:
### Keeping track of database versions, deployment scripts, and any number of ad hoc database changes is a pain. In this session, youâ€™ll see how to manage database changes easily using source control within SQL Server Management Studio. Source controlling databases is faster than you think with SQL Source Control; you can track who made database changes, what they changed, when, and why.
