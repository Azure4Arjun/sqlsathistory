## Title: Introduction to Cassandra
## Abstract:
### Apache Cassandra is a massively scalable NoSQL database. Cassandra is in use at Netflix, eBay, Twitter, Urban Airship, Constant Contact, Reddit, Cisco, OpenX, Digg, CloudKick, Ooyala, and more companies that have large, active data sets. The largest known Cassandra cluster has over 300 TB of data in over 400 machines.  Cassandra is fault tolerant with no single point of failure, performant, fully-decentralized, durable and gives the developer control over the desired consistency, availability and partitioning (CAP) tradeoffs.  This presentation provides a brief overview and introduction to Cassandra for those wishing to understand if Cassandra is right for them.
