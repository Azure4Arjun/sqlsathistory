# What’s this ‘Scaffolding a CRUD’ all about? Build a Website from your SQL Database
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#435-El-Paso-2015)
Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Gabriel Villa
## Title: What’s this ‘Scaffolding a CRUD’ all about? Build a Website from your SQL Database
## Abstract:
### So you have a SQL Server database, and you want a web site for your tables? Come see how to develop and deploy a simple .NET website against any SQL Server database. See firsthand how to use Microsoft’s Entity Framework, ASP.Net MVC and other tricks to develop a website by writing very little code. Take home the ability to create and deploy a simple website to your own database once this demonstration is seen.

# Why should I care about the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#435-El-Paso-2015)
Event Date: 29-08-2015 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.

## Speaker: Chris Hyde
## Title: Row-Based Security in SSRS and SSAS
## Abstract:
### It is relatively straight-forward to grant a user access to a particular SSRS report, multi-dimensional cube, or tabular model table, but what happens when the user needs access to the object but should be denied access to view certain rows of data?  In this session we'll investigate a real-world solution to this common BI problem.
