## Speaker: Jeff Burns
## Title: Avoid Shiny Object Syndrome and Create Visualizations That Last
## Abstract:
### You’ve spent days (or even weeks) getting the data perfect. After a few days, you've put together a dashboard that is so flashy it could be on display in Times Square. You check in with the stakeholders a month later only to learn they no longer use it. :(

Your diagnosis: Shiny Object Syndrome. It’s real. It’s prevalent. And almost completely preventable.

In this session you will leave with 5 field-tested rules to follow when creating visualizations that will make your users return to your dashboard over and over…and compel them to share it with others!
