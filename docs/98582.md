## Title: Query Plans For Visual Learners
## Abstract:
### You’ve looked at query plans and done some tuning, but you’re not sure what’s going on underneath. Hash Match? Merge Join? Watch both come to life in animations, and more! See (not just hear) the inner workings of a plan, and learn about the details that matter for performance. When plans make sense, tuning will become easier, and maybe even fun!
