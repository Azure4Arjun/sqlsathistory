## Title: Data Estate Modernization : Taking the guess work out of migrating to the cloud.
## Abstract:
### Moving to the cloud should not be difficult. Most organizations make the mistake of wanting to modernize their applications and databases on-prem first before moving to cloud. This is normally very expensive, leads to delays and often abandonment of projects.

In this session we will look at :
How to take the guess work out of developing a cloud roadmap. 
Look at how cost effective cloud will be in a very accurate manner.
How to assess applications and their dependencies.
Reduce time to cloud by telling exactly which lines of code to change in your applications and databases.
Effort estimation to complete each task.
Including 3 migration options in Microsoft Azure for your applications and databases.
