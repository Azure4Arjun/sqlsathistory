## Title: Baking Extended Events recipes without breaking a sweat
## Abstract:
### OK, you got the message: Extended Events is the way to monitor SQL Server from now on. However, you feel overwhelmed by XML shredding and the simplest of tasks seems impossible. 
Fear not: in this demo intensive session I will show you how to tackle the most challenging tasks without writing a single line of code. I will use the open-source tool XESmartTarget to audit logins, find unused objects, capture and notify deadlocks and much more.
Stop doing things the hard way! Join me and learn how XESmartTarget can do all the heavy lifting for you.
