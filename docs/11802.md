## Speaker: Constantin Klein
## Title: StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
## Abstract:
### The number of sensors is growing and growing and brings us closer to the "Internet of things". Applications, that have to process a big amount of data from event streams are a logical consequence. Some developers might have heard from Reactive Extensions (Rx) already, but Microsoft offers with StreamInsight (SI) another comprehensive platform for these scenarios.

In this session you will learn what a great addition for your toolbox StreamInsight is, if you have to develop applications, that have to handle complex events (CEP- Complex Event Processing). See how you can start with this technologie and how easy it is to jump in for .NET developers.
