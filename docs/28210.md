## Title: Database Replication - What, How and Why
## Abstract:
### Database replication doesn't get much attention, especially now that the AlwaysOn features have been released into the wild.  

However, replication offers another way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" HA/DR scenarios.

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication.

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.
