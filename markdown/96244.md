## Title: Monitor Power BI
## Abstract:
### Monitoring Power BI means having knowledge of all the content currently hosted in your Power BI tenant. What datasets and reports have been published? What users have access to these resources? How often are they looking at these reports? How have data refreshes been performing?

By monitoring, you will truly understand what makes you an Administrator of Power BI. You'll see the different screens it takes to monitor everything in your tenant. Plus, you'll discover if there's a better way to monitor your tenant through collecting API data and analyzing it to derive some actionable insights for improved data governance in your companies.

BI expert Angel Abundez will demo the Power BI administrative screens you use today to monitor your tenant. Then he'll do some PowerShell development in VS Code to collect API data and see if it's possible to use that data in Power BI for added insights.
