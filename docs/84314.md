## Title: New capabilities of Azure Data Factory v2
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory v1 has not been considered a full blown ETL solution on the market. Data Factory v2 is now introduced to fill in the gaps. We will deliver the understanding of the different features  functionalities of both versions as well as a summary comparison between the two. We will also demonstrate the latest and greatest capabilities by orchestrating an end-to-end pipeline with Data Factory v2 including machine learning workloads with Azure DataBricks.
