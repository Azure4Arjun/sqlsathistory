## Speaker: Buck Woody
## Title: SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduces a new feature called the "Resource Governor". It allows you to set limits (both minimum and maximum) on your SQL Server Instance's use of CPU and Memory - helping to prevent runaway queries, shoring up your Service Level Agreements, and aiding in consolidating your SQL Server databases onto fewer Instances or even in Virtualization. Come hear Buck Woody, Microsoft's "Real World DBA", present an introduction to this feature, and show you an overview of its functionality and flow.
