## Speaker: Michael Frandsen
## Title: High Performance Infrastructure for SQL Server 2014
## Abstract:
### Since SQL Server 2012 a paradigm shift is occurring in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. Come and hear why you no longer will need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and why I/O is no longer a problem.
In this session I will go into the new storage features in Windows Server 2012 and R2 and how they relate to SQL Server 2012 and how SQL Server 2014 expands on this.
Through working with the Core Windows Server team in Redmond during the development of Windows 8.1/R2 I did a lot of work with technologies which have been around for some time, but unavailable to Windows Server installations. We will talk about InfiniBand, Multi-path I/O, RDMA, RoCE, NAND Flash storage, latency and much more.
Being in the Data Platforms Advisors group for the SQL Server development team in Redmond, I have worked with completely new concepts of integration between SQL Server and modern hardware, many of these surfacing in SQL Server 2014
