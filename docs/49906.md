## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: All things time related
## Abstract:
### In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you different techniques and models related to time: process mining, lean, six sigma, process datawarehousing, relational temporal theory and SQL 2016 temporal
