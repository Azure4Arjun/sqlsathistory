## Speaker: Matt Gordon
## Title: Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?
## Abstract:
### Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.
