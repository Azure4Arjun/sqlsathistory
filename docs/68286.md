## Title: SQL Server 2016 In-Memory OLTP Tables
## Abstract:
### In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016 has been reborn. Many limitations within the previous versions have been removed, making it a viable option for a variety of workloads. In this session we will highlight critical issues in implementing and managing SQL Server 2016 instances and databases containing In-Memory tables. The bulk of this session will be spent walking through the process of identifying candidate In-Memory tables, migrating an on-disk table to an in-memory table and comparing performance.
