## Title: Know Thyself. The Path to Self-Service BI Success
## Abstract:
### How ready is the business for your self-service BI tools? How ready are your tools for the business? Are you waiting for users to "adopt" your BI capabilities? 

In this session, we will discuss finding the self-service sweet spot between data, BI, and business priorities that maximizes analytical value and minimizes development costs and efforts. Different types of users will be discussed and the self-service strategies that can be employed for each. For example, the CEO is likely to want a different view of the data than a product analyst. Let's talk about when to pivot and when to scatter.

Examples will be shown using Microsoft Power BI. 

Instead of waiting for users to adopt, get them to EMBRACE self-service BI tools as a key component of business success.
