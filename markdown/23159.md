## Title: Building an Enterprise Data Repository with BIML
## Abstract:
### Building out an Enterprise Data Warehouse can be extremely time consuming when developing the initial ETL building blocks.  Using a Data Repository and BIML to centralize enterprise data can decrease Data Warehouse development time.  It can be used as a central repository for ad-hoc reporting, and keep an audit trail of source system changes.  This session will look at the benefits of centralizing data in its original format and how to automate the collection and auditing using BIML.
