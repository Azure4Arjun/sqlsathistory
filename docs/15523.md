## Title: How to Build a Centralized Database Monitoring Solution – Never Miss a Backup
## Abstract:
### As every DBA knows, the one question you want to be able to answer affirmatively is “Can you recover that data?”  

Monitoring is critical, but monitoring methods can be imperfect.  Traditional methods are difficult to set up and maintain across your entire environment, resulting in incomplete monitoring and missed alerts, so that it’s difficult to be sure of your answer to that all important question. 

This presentation will:

•	Show you how to implement a better way to monitor your database environment that is more efficient, easier to maintain, and guarantees that you never miss an alert.
•	Share the methodology, framework, and key syntax, so that you are certain the databases you are responsible for are always up, always backed up, and never run out of disk/file space.

So that your answer to that all important question is always YES!
