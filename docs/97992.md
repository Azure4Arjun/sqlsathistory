## Title: Why I use cursors in SQL for performance
## Abstract:
### "Cursors are bad, never use them!" How many times have you been told this by your senior DBAs or developers? 
In this session I will explore why I use cursors to solve certain problems. Discuss when they are appropriate, and when they are not, as well as a performance comparison to non-cursor based solutions.
