## Title: Logic Apps - Data Orchestration in Azure
## Abstract:
### For a long time we've dreamed of full-functioned SSIS in the cloud. If you've wrestled with Data Factory, well... It's not quite there yet. Logic Apps fills a huge gap in the Azure story and if you've not tried it yet - you should.

Logic Apps provides control-flow style functionality and can orchestrate data from a huge range of common sources. Want to scrape twitter, perform sentiment analysis and write to PowerBI? Its now possible with zero coding.

This session will introduce Logic Apps  how it fits into the Modern Azure Warehouse then demonstrate building a twitter scraper step by step, demonstrating the process of building, deploying and debugging an app.
