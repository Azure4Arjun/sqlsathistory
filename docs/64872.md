## Title: Multi-tenant database architectures – from small scale to hyper-scale
## Abstract:
### Need to design the database backend for a cloud application? Come and hear about different choices of multi-tenant architectures,  from small scale covering tenants in the hundreds all the way up to hyper-scale supporting hundreds of thousands of tenants.  We will cover the three main architectures “Separate Databases” , “Shared Database, Separate Schemas” and “Shared Database, Shared Schemas”  and how they can be implemented on Azure SQL database and elastic pools.  Pros and cons for security, performance and administration will be discussed in each of these architectures.
