Event Date: 17-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Development
## Speaker: Steve Stedman
## Title: Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it.  With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as a temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query.  Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's.  One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which no only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  This presentation is targeted for database programmers and administrators who are familiar with TRANSACT SQL, Subqueries, and advanced join techniques.

# Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-114)
Event Date: 17-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Design and Implement BI Like Edison! 
## Abstract:
### As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

Event Date: 17-03-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice
## Abstract:
### A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we will gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.
