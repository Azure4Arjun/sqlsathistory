## Title: New features for devs in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Do you know that now you can DIE with SQL Server 2016? Well, only if you know that DIE is DROP IF EXISTS. We will time travel with temporal data, will secure our data with row-level security, dynamic data masking and always encrypted, will stretch our database to Azure and even talk JSON natively.
