## Title: How do you validate your ETL?
## Abstract:
### After creating your perfect ETL process, how do you know if it is performing properly over time? It should be monitored and validated regularly. I will discuss several different types of validation as well as different methods to validate these attributes. I hope others will be willing to share their experiences with this session as well.
