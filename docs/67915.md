## Title: Linux Administration for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### Times are certainly changing with Microsoftâ€™s recent announcement to adopt the Linux operating system with the release of SQL Server 2017, and you should be prepared to support it. But, what is Linux? Why run your critical databases on an unfamiliar operating system? How do you handle the basics, such as backing up to a network share or add additional drives for data, logs, and tempdb files?

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBAs understand the basics of Linux and how it differs from Windows, all the way from basic management to performance monitoring. By the end of the session, you will be able to launch your own Linux-based SQL Server instance on a production-ready VM.
