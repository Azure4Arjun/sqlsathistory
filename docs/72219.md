## Title: Design Myths
## Abstract:
### Prepare for a surprising, intriguing, and even controversial session. 45 years after Codd defined the Relational Model, there are still so many parts misunderstood. For sure there are points where you will be surprised and change your view, even though you might have been convinced for years that your view is the correct one, and even if you learned this at a university. Please note that this is theoretical session, using a bit of logic and a bit of mathematics.
