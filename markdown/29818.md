## Speaker: Douglas Brendle
## Title: What is this Cache and why is it so big?
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder what's in your SQL Plan cache? Wonder why or how it got so big? This session will cover what it is, how it's used, how it can affect performance and how poor application and query design can make it worse. Rather than put participants to sleep with a slide deck we will get down and dirty with lots of demos.
