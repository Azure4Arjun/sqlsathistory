## Title: Azure Machine Learning, notes from the field
## Abstract:
### Machine learning makes it possible to analyse large amounts of data, and it opens the doors to new insight, operational efficiency, direct marketing and the ability to make qualified decisions about the future. The machine learning technology has been known for years, and now it's finally available, and easy to use, for everyone.
 
Come to my session to get an overview of the possibilities Azure Machine Learning enables, and to learn from some of the experience I've obtained working with different machine learning projects. As this is an intermediate session, we will be looking closer at some of the machine learning algorithms.
