## Title: Extended Events: Successful Troubleshooting recipes
## Abstract:
### Since Profiler was set as deprecated Extended Events is becoming more and more the default tool for event capturing in SQL Server.

In this session you will see some very cool recipes for troubleshooting, such as deadlock capture, blocked process capture, page splits capture and more, besides queries to easily show the information captured by the XE session, allowing you to apply these techniques to immediately monitor your environment.
