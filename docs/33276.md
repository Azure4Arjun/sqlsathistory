## Title: ADO.NET Entity Framework v4 - Part 1
## Abstract:
### The first version of the ADO.NET Entity Framework, included in .NET Framework 3.5 SP 1, had several shortcomings. Microsoft has been busy working on the V4 release of the Framework and Entity Framework, to be released with Visual Studio 2010. This session will take a look at how the Entity Framework v4 can be used to develop N-Tier business applications and highlight some of the shortcomings that were fixed and some that havenâ€™t been fixed yet.
