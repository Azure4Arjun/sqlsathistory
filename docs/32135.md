## Title: Log Shipping vs. Replication; the Great Debate
## Abstract:
### Many SQL Server DBA's are tasked with the responsibility of choosing an appropriate disaster recovery, reporting, or failover solution for their organization.  Much of the time the choice comes down to replication versus log shipping.  And while both solutions can be extremely effective, there are both subtle  major differences between them that can guide you to choose one over the other.  This presentation gets to the nuts and bolts of the two technologies, and helps you make an educated recommendation and implementation.
