## Speaker: Yuval Klein
## Title: Sql Server and Big Data : the Hybrid approach
## Abstract:
### In the session I will discuss how can we Sql Developers interact with data that is in Data lake such as hadoop , hive , hbase etc. also I will demonstrate how can we use the SQL language to interact with data that is inside files in the data lake. the approach is called the hybrid approach since organisations need to create data lake aside of the main database but still the best way to approach data is using the SQL language we all know and all our BI visualization is based on.
