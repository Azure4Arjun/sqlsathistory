## Title: Processing Temporal Telemetry Data -aka- Storing BigData in a Small Space
## Abstract:

The session will also cover how to deal with missing data points, duplicates and how to aggregate and groom the data over time.
The know how of this session can be applied to all data that is collected over time and needs to be very precise for a few months and than can be aggregated into a more trend like data.
