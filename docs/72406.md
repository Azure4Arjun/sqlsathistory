## Title: An Introduction to Predictive Modeling with R
## Abstract:
### In this presentation we'll learn the basics of constructing a predictive model in the R programming language.  We'll start by discussing visualizations that help us understand our data and then build and test a predictive model. Key points include selecting the model, training it, and evaluating the model's effectiveness. In the process, we'll learn about the R language and the popular integrated development environment RStudio.  Find out what all the hype is about!
