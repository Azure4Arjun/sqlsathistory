## Speaker: David Pechon
## Title: Virtualize all the things!
## Abstract:
### Virtualization has pretty much become the de facto standard in datacenters today.  However, there are a few holdouts as people aren’t confident that today’s modern hypervisors can give their applications the performance they need.  As someone who’s evangelized virtualization for nearly a decade, David Pechon will show why there’s no reason why you shouldn’t virtualize.
