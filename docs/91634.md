## Title: Where should I store my database?
## Abstract:
### For this presentation, I'll go through the Top 5 locations for where we can store a SQL database today: physical, virtual, IaaS (Azure VM and EC2), Managed Instances, or DBaaS (Azure SQL DB).  We'll spend 5-10min on each offering going over pros/cons and several use cases. You'll know which avenue is a home run and which services will be horribly wrong for your database.
