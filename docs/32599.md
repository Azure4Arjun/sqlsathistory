## Title: EntityFramework 360: Getting Started
## Abstract:
### While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Unfortunately, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution.

Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme with the Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework.  In this session, we’ll…

•	Explore the Entity Framework 4, its components and see how it all works
•	Generate a business object model with database mappings, demonstrating database-first, model-first and code-only approaches
•	Walk through a variety of code examples that show how to interact with the model
•	Show how the Entity Framework automatically tracks data changes and generates updates
•	Deep-dive
