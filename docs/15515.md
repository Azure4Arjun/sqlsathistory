## Title: Biggest Loser: Database Edition
## Abstract:
### Fat!  That’s how you’d have to describe most databases these days.  Add up all the costs and each Terabyte ends up costing as much as $75,000.  The Biggest Looser: Database Edition presentation shows you how to put your database on a diet using the features of SQL Server:
Compression, Filtered indexes, Sparse Columns, Maintenance, REBUILD and REORGANIZE, Index management and Application Changes.  

Topics include 
- Calculating storage for each row and measuring the actual storage.
- Finding hidden overhead such as Snapshot Isolation bytes
- How to recover extra space
- Why NOT to SHRINK your database files
- Rebuilding files to recover all the extra space

Managing your data well can lead to savings in disk space as much as 75%.
