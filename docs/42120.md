## Speaker: Daniel McLeod
## Title: Guided Tour of a Real World Biml Solution
## Abstract:
### Have you been curious about Biml but find many of the samples and initial tutorials to be a bit theoretical? Would you rather see a Biml solution that works with real-world data? Look no further! In this session, Daniel McLeod, who works on the Biml development team, will demonstrate an end-to-end patterns-based metadata-driven integration using a real world Customer Interaction Center (http://www.inin.com/solutions/Pages/Contact-Center-Software.aspx) database. With just the source database and a simple but complete metadata store, the Biml solution will generate a data mart that is PowerBI ready. All Biml code will be shared with attendees.
