## Title: Multi-Tenant database using RLS â€“ Case Study
## Abstract:
### At R2C Group we considered numerous approaches to supporting a multi-tenant environment for our legacy SQL database and application suite.   After careful analysis and some prototyping we selected a design using the new at the time in MS-SQL 2016 Row Level Security (RLS) capability.
This presentation will discuss the analysis that went into the decision then jump right into the implementation.    I'll share actual code used and demonstrate how it all works.
