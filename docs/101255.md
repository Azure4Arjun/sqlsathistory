## Title: Architecting a Modern Business Intelligence Data Platform
## Abstract:
### The power of cloud storage and compute power has made data warehousing and big data possible for businesses of all sizes. What was once a large capital expenditure and multi-year implementation can now be deployed and ready to use within minutes and allow any organization to collect, query and discover insights from their structured and unstructured data sources. 

With tightly integrated services and a user-centric approach, a cloud-native data platform can fit transparently into your business data strategy and leverage already existing and familiar development and management skills.
 
In this session we will look at the main components and reference architectures for building a modern business intelligence platform that includes data warehousing, big data and analytics with examples using Microsoft Azure. We will talk about ways to integrate with on-premises systems as well as lessons learned from building these Enterprise BI Data Platforms for multiple clients.
