Event Date: 16-05-2015 - Session time: 08:15:00 - Track: Reporting  Visualization
## Speaker: Dave Mattingly
## Title: Database: The Motion Picture
## Abstract:
### Power up your data presentations with Power View and Power Map. Charts and maps can be made interactive, generated on the fly, or recorded as video with a soundtrack and special effects. Instead of trying to make your point with a boring list of names, numbers, and dates, put on your movie director's hat and give your data the Hollywood treatment as you yell, "Lights! Cameras! Action!"
