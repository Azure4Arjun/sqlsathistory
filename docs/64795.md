# SQLSaturday #667 - Oslo 2017
Event Date: 02-09-2017 - Session time: 10:50:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Anders Pedersen
## Title: I/O Tuning 101
## Abstract:
### One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.
