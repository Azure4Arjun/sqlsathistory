## Speaker: Dan Andrews
## Title: The DBA's Role With N-tier Applications
## Abstract:
### This session is for DBAs with little or no application architecture experience and/or application developers who want to work on enterprise applications.  We'll go over N-tier applications, what are the different tiers, and why DBAs should encourage enterprise application development in their company.  While the architecture is independent of any specific language, any examples will be in C#.  If done right, multiple languages can access the data in the same way and receive the same results.
