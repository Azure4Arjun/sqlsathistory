## Speaker: Craig Bryden
## Title: Creating and Managing a Power BI Enterprise Deployment
## Abstract:
### When implementing Power BI in any enterprise, there are many options that the project team faces, and the choices are not always obvious. The different approaches are often dictated by organisational constraints, which are often different for many organisations. In this presentation, Craig will take you on a journey of discovery about the different best practices and options you have when implementing Power BI in your enterprise. Among others, we will discuss topics such as:
•	The different data storage and connectivity modes.
•	Power BI Pro vs Power BI Premium.
•	Efficient use of workspaces and apps.
•	Security Considerations.
•	Content Governance.
•	How all of the above (and other) topics impact your implementation.
Craig will bring his extensive real-world experience to this presentation, in which the audience is encouraged to participate in the discussion.
