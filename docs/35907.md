## Title: TURNING YOUR DATA INTO A CORPORATE ASSET â€“ BECOME A ROCK STAR!
## Abstract:
### Here is your chance to STAND OUT, MAKE A DIFFERENCE, and BE A ROCK STAR!  Avastone, in conjunction with Qlik, will show you how to leverage tools specifically targeted at data quality, data visualization, and turning your data into the corporate asset that will propel you, the company you work for, and your individual skill set forward.  This presentation will focus on data as a corporate asset, ways to ensure that data maintains a high level of quality, and being able to visualize the data in a way that a company is able to make educated decisions.  The two systems we will focus on during this presentation are SQL Server Data Quality Services and QlikSense.  Managing data has taken on a heightened level of importance as companies strive to be more customer-centric in a bid to compete on a global level.  The tools we will cover will make you a better steward of your data and push your company out in front of your competition.
