## Title: TFS for SQL/BI Developers
## Abstract:
### If you do any kind of SQL Server or BI development, you eventually have to grapple with the problem of keeping multiple copies of your work.  You either need to maintain stored procedure and DDL scripts or you have copies of SSIS and SSRS reports to keep up with.  In most cases, this problem starts off small as you need to have development versus production copies of your code.  But eventually, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your "source code" as your environment becomes more complex and as you potentially have to start working with a team of other developers.  During this session, we'll talk about Team Foundation Server (TFS) and show you the different ways it can be used to keep up with all the different types of source code you might be responsible for -- from full database designs to complete BI solutions.
