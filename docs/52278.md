## Title: Biml and SSIS Frameworks
## Abstract:
### You’ve probably heard that it’s a data integration best practice to build small, unit-of-work SSIS packages. You’ve heard that with Biml you can create a lot of SSIS packages in very little time. You follow this advice and end up with dozens of SSIS packages. Now what? A metadata-driven SSIS Execution Framework will simplify the execution of several SSIS packages down to a simple, one-line stored procedure call. But then, how does one manage all the metadata required to populate the SSIS Execution Framework? Biml to the rescue!
