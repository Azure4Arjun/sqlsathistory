## Title: Introduction to Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### Big data processing solutions don't need to be complicated to get up and running, and thanks to Azure Databricks, it isn't! In this session, we'll cover what Azure Databricks is, go over some popular use cases, and what you can expect from an administrative standpoint if you decide to implement solutions with it. We'll also cover the basics of setting up Azure Databricks and go over what goes on "under the covers" in the cloud when you use it to provision compute for your big data processing needs. 

With plenty of demos on how to configure cloud storage, work with Databricks notebooks, and even some Apache Spark thrown in, you'll come to appreciate very quickly just how powerful (and flexible) a solution like Databricks is.
