## Title: DataOps - Deploy SQL Server Databases Using Azure Pipelines
## Abstract:
### The database is sometimes one of the last areas considered when planning DevOps for new and existing projects. If you are new to Azure Pipelines or Database Projects in Visual Studio this presentation will show you how to combine these technologies to create a consistent database deployment across all your development environments. If you are already using Azure Pipelines and Visual Studio for your applications, you will learn how to include your database. We will go over creating a database project and deploying a Dacpac manually to multiple environments. I will point out things to consider and how to add custom deployment scripts and build validation. Then we will setup an Azure DevOps account and step through creating a pipeline to automatically deploy a data project stored in a git repository. We'll also use Key Vault to store the deployment credentials to avoid sharing around that password everyone uses to deploy manually.
