## Title: Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut
## Abstract:
### Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.

# Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel
## Abstract:
### Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.

During this beginner level session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will be covering all of those questions and many more that are all too common among PowerShell noobs such as: How do I figure out what the commands are? And how do I extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server? This session is designed for those people who haven’t yet embraced PowerShell and want to know how to get started. The first beta of PowerShell was released 10 years ago and with it now being part of Microsoft’s common engineering criteria, it’s not going away any time soon so what are you waiting for?

Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.

## Title: Introduction to the Power BI Desktop
## Abstract:
### Most of us are overwhelmed with data from all the different applications that we use on a daily basis.
