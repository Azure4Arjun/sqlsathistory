## Title: Mastering Plan Guides: Tell The Query Optimizer You're The Boss
## Abstract:
### It's Monday morning and everyone is complaining that the database is slow. You see the problem - even though indexes aren't fragmented and statistics are up to date the query optimizer is choosing a bad plan. Users want it fixed (now!) and you know a way to get things working again but you're not allowed to change code because...it's production. What's a good DBA going to do? Show the query optimizer that you're the boss with plan guides! In this session you'll learn what plan guide are, how they work, and when to (and not to) use them to make under-performing queries behave.
