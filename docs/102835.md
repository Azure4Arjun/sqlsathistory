## Title: Faster Transactions: Query Tuning for Data Manipulation
## Abstract:
### Your server has dozens of CPUs, terabytes of RAM, and solid-state drives, and yet your UPDATE query still takes hours. Why? In this demo-filled session, we examine common pitfalls for any SQL professional who manipulates large sets of data with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. We discuss potential issues involving data pages, locks, and the transaction log, as well as techniques you can use to improve performance.
