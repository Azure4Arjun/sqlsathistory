## Title: Tired of the CRUD?  Automate it!
## Abstract:
### T4 templating support was added in the March 2014 release of SSDT.  This means we can now create a T4 template to automatically create CRUD procedures for all the tables in our database project.  Sure ORM tools like EF and nHibernate can handle CRUD operations in code, but if you want to provide an API to your database and avoid the tedious work of hand creating simple CRUD procedures this is the session for you!

After this session you will:

1. Understand the basics of T4 templating
2. Have a basic understanding of the Dac object model
3. Be able to create a script that will create 100's or even 1000's of CRUD procedures in seconds.
