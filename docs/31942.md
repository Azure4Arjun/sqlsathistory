## Title: Migrate SQL Server Apps to SQL Azure Cloud DB
## Abstract:
### This session will introduce you to the world of database cloud utility computing with SQL Azure. We will walk through a step-by-step process of migrating an on-premises SQL Server database to SQL Azure. Weâ€™ll demonstrate a reporting application that works as-is regardless of the SQL Server database location on prem or cloud. You will also experience developing T-SQL code in Visual Studio and utilize SSMS to deploy code from development to production in SQL Azure using the Data-Tier Application DAC capability. Lastly, we will demonstrate using the Silverlight Database Manager tool for managing and modifying your cloud databases directly.
