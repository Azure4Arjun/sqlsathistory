## Title: Clusters Your Way - #SANLess clustering
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Cluster MVP Dave Bermingham will discuss how to create #SANLess clusters in environments where traditional shared storage clusters are impractical or impossible. He will also be discussing high performance clusters leveraging SSD and Flash-based PCIe storage for faster SQL application response times - no SAN (or SAN Admin required) - and be touching on HA protection and native Windows Failover Clustering in cloud environments.
