## Speaker: Bryan Smith
## Title: Building a Business Intelligence Competency Center
## Abstract:
### If you build it, they will come!  While we may all hope that this will be the case, the successful adoption of the data warehouse and other Business Intelligence tools requires continued engagement with the business.  In this session, we will explore strategies for encouraging not only adoption but integration of BI into the day-to-day activities of our organizations through what has become known as a Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC).  This is a non-technial session intended for BI architects and managers.
