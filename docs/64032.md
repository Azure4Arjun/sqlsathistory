## Title: Virtual HA: Running FCI and AGs in a Virtual Environment
## Abstract:
### High availability can be different in a virtual environment.  Attendees will learn the pros and cons of running SQL Server FCI or Availability Groups in a virtual environment. In this session we will:
Offer a comparison of the different high availability options that exist between all of available technologies.
Discuss how FCI or AG impacts features of VMware and Hyper-V, and how to work with the administrators of your virtual environment.
Walk through all of the storage options in order to determine the best fit for your organization.
Review key settings and configurations for the virtual platform, the virtual machine, and SQL Server; and demonstrate the best settings to ensure top performance.
