## Title: Small Scale Data Collection Using PowerShell -  Going NSA Style!
## Abstract:
### While we are not the NSA, certain vital data needs to be collected – for example audit data, trace data, session information, performance data etc. – all to a central SQL Server repository, for analysis. In this session let us see how freely available PowerShell code can be used to collect data from multiple SQL Servers instances/databases. At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge and ability to collect pretty much any data to a central repository with just a couple of lines of code all in a manner that works specifically for you!
