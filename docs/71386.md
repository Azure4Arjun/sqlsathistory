## Speaker: Ryan Casey
## Title: Data Modeling for the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:
### A theoretical discussion on two methods that professional data modelers use to model data (ERD and star schema). 

We discuss why we need to model data, benefits / value of modeling data, and why we select one modeling technique over the other. Once we understand why and when we use these different modeling techniques, we will focus in on dimensional modeling that is used when developing data warehouses, SSAS cubes and Power BI. 

Sample diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion.
