## Title: SQL University 201: Managing a SQL Server pt 2
## Abstract:
### In our 101 session we did a high level overview of the world of SQL Server and how things work within that environment. In this session we'll dive a little deeper and talk about important tasks expected of a DBA such as backups and restores, general maintenance, understanding various resources and virtualization of SQL Server. Attending the 101 session is not a pre-requisite so feel free to join us and continue our SQL Server education!
