## Title: Querying SQL Server through the Entity Framework and LINQ
## Abstract:
### When using the entity framework, a good understanding of linq and how the entity framework maps its linq expressions to SQL is key in writing good queries and taking advantage of LINQ hierarchical nature.
In this session we will briefly explore how linq queries are translated to sql and how to test them and optimize its use.
