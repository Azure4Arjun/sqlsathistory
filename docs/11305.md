## Title: Big Data for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### If youâ€™re like most Database Administrators then you already work with data that is big, so what is this big data thing all about?  This session will cover the significance of big data by comparing and contrasting it to the SQL Server relational database environment.  It will also demonstrate the value a big data ecosystem can provide to your technology infrastructure organization by using it to complement your existing data architecture, and by having it co-exist in effective ways with your SQL Server databases. Live demonstrations will show how you to get maximum value out of big data with tools such as Sqoop, Hive and Pig so that you can perform bulk data transfers, queries, and ETL using SQL Server and HDFS, the Hadoop file system.
