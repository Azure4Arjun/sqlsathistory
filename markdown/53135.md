## Speaker: Tom Staab
## Title: SQL Writing SQL
## Abstract:
### Have you ever had to move every object in a schema to a different schema? What about dropping and recreating a set of constraints to allow you to alter a dependent table? This session will demonstrate ways to use T-SQL and various catalog views to dynamically generate SQL statements that can save you time and effort in what would otherwise be tedious, manual tasks. I will provide a background followed by some examples and then open the floor to questions.
