## Speaker: Kamil Nowinski
## Title: Azure Databricks 101
## Abstract:
### Many sources? Various format? Unstructured data? Big Data? You might think that these only a buzz words. Not really. These days it's a part of modern data flow architecture. No matter what do you use - SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Data Factory, Data Lake... somewhere there you can find Databricks. So, the question is: what the Azure Databricks is and which scenario it could be used in?
Use Databricks to analyse large DataSets at scale, write Python, Scala or SQL command in one notebook to ingest, process and push the data to the required target. Use Databricks' notebook as a part of Azure Data Factory pipeline. We also will try to answer whether Databricks would replace SSIS as a modern ETL/ELT process?
If you are wondering about all these things - you should join me in this session.

# Getting To Know SQL Server Encryption Capabilities
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#955---North-Macedonia-2021)
Event Date: 17-04-2021 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Getting To Know SQL Server Encryption Capabilities
## Abstract:
### With stricter EU privacy laws like GDPR, the need to encrypt data is greater than ever.
In this session we'll look at what SQL Server offers in this area:
1) symmetric and asymmetric server encryption which lets the server encrypt table data and control the keys, 
2) Always Encrypted (AE) which works similarly to server encryption but the client control the keys meaning server can't decrypt the data
3) Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) which encrypts your data at rest making getting data from stolen drives useless
4) creating secure SSL/TLS communication channels between your apps and the server to prevent clear text network traffic which can be observed

# Temporal Data in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#955---North-Macedonia-2021)
Event Date: 17-04-2021 - Session time: 16:30:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Dejan Sarka
## Title: Temporal Data in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Databases that serve business applications should often support temporal data. For example, suppose a contract with a supplier is valid for a limited time only. It can be valid from a specific point in time onward, or it can be valid for a specific time interval—from a starting time point to an ending time point. In addition, many times you need to audit all changes in one or more tables. You might also need to be able to show the state in a specific point in time, or all changes made to a table in a specific period of time. From the data integrity perspective, you might need to implement many additional temporal specific constraints.
This session introduces the temporal problems, deals with solutions that go beyond SQL Server 2016 to 2019 support, and shows out-of-the-box solution in SQL Server, including:
•	Defining temporal data
•	Application versioned tables
•	System versioned tables
•	What kind of temporal support is still missing

## Title: Deep Learning advancements and why data is the key ingredient of AI revolution today?
## Abstract:
### This session explains how recent development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes gap between human and machine smaller than ever before.

Traditionally AI systems have been tested in chess and the same has been done to demonstrate the power of AlphaZero. But, instead of playing against human, it played against the best (at the time) chess program Stockfish. It learned about the game by playing a large number of games with itself, learning in the process.

Session will also explain what is so revolutionary in AlphaZero approach to AI and how this new approach can be used in different areas of processing visual information, bio-medicine, autonomous driving, robotics and AI generated images/videos of humans. IoT and large amounts of machine-generated data is the main ingredient of AI today.
