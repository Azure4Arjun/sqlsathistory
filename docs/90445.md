## Title: Self-Service ETL: The PowerBI Data Flows
## Abstract:
### What was already good has became even better. We were already able to make ETL in PowerBI using M, now, using the PoweBI Data Flows we are able to store the ETL on the PowerBI Portal, control the ETL execution, the data among many ETL steps and share the result with many Power BI files, instead of having to duplicate M scripts accross different .PBIX files

In this session you will understand better what Data Flows can bring to our already powerful self-service BI tools
