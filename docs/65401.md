## Title: Through the looking glass on Agile Database Development
## Abstract:
### A few of you have heard of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), you may have started using it but not entirely sure where to start and you're being pushed to make sure it's "Agile", "DevOps", "CI/CD" etc etc. This is more of a beginners session on how I've gone about getting monolithic old databases into an Agile practice so you can hit the ground running should you require to do so.
