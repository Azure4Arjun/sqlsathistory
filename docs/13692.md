## Title: Backups: Getting the Most Out of Your Storage
## Abstract:
### In this session we will compare SQL Server's native backups with the compressed backups available in SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, Red Gate's SQL Backup Pro v7, and the various configurations of Red Gate's SQL HyperBac tools.  We will compare them with real world scenarios so that you can decide which tool is the best for your scenarios.
