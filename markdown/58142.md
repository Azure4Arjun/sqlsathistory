## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery patterns with SQL Server and Windows Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Cloud, cloud and cloud. That's all we hear nowadays, but there's still life out of the Cloud!

Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 can together broader the capabilities of your systems. With regards to High Availability and Disaster Recovery, we have more flexibility by taking advantage of the improved AlwaysOn Availability Groups, Windows Server Failover Cluster and, of course, Azure's integration.

During this session we will explore those new possibilities, checking what is new, the current limitations and what we can build by taking advantage of all the improvements.
