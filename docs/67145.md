## Title: Why are there pirates and snakes in my SQL Server?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 included R as an optional feature (Arrrrrr), and now the CTPs of SQL Server 2017 include Python.

In this session, we’ll look at why these languages are now available in SQL Server and the capabilities that they offer. We’ll also try and answer some questions as to what the whole ‘data science’ thing is in the first place, and why you should be interested in it.
