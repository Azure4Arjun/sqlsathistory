## Abstract:
### Heard about BigData and Hadoop and want to make some sense of it? You will learn about what Hadoop is and what is it not, and how it can help your organization. We will cover Microsoft HDInsight as a cloud solution and Hortonworks HDP 2.0 as an onsite platform for Hadoop implementations.
