## Title: The SQL Server Transaction Log for Developers
## Abstract:
### SQL Server tracks all changes to a database's data and schema in the transaction log. This makes it the most important file in any database. Understanding transaction log architecture and behavior will help you develop code that will maximize performance and minimize resource consumption. Join me to learn about transaction log architecture, batching transactions, rollback activity, and the effect these things can have on performance.
