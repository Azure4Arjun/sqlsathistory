## Title: Introduction to the Power BI Desktop
## Abstract:
### Most of us are overwhelmed with data from all the different applications that we use on a daily basis.  Bringing all the data together is often a very time-consuming and sometimes a challenging process.  Even further, attempting to analyze and visualize the data poses new challenges that is sometime difficult or impossible to overcome.  Now with Power BI this can all be made very simple.  Individuals, ranging from novice information workers to advanced IT professionals can quickly and easily transform, analyze and visualize data using a single tool, Power BI Desktop.   In this course we will work through four main topics: Shaping Data, Building a Data Model, Visualizing Data and Using the Power BI Server.
