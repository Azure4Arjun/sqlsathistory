## Title: The Creepy DBA, How to Stalk Your Users
## Abstract:
### Do you know when your users are using the production login accounts from their workstations?  Are you aware of changes being made to the development servers that may impact future deployments?  Has the new Junior DBA start giving out access like candy?  As DBAs, we are responsible for knowing and acting on all of this and much more.  Fortunately, SQL Server provides a number of features that you can use to monitor and track user activity.  In this session, weâ€™ll look at these features and demonstrate how you can use them to the extent that your users find you creepy!
