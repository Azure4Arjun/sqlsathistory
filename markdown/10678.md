## Title: Implementing a HIPAA Compliance Strategy with SQL Server
## Abstract:
### HIPAA puts a lot of responsibility on our companies and compliance can be hard to maintain. Today medical data is more valuable on the black market than a social security number or a credit card.  As DBAs we're charged with the security of our data and thus act as a front line defense.

In this hour long session We'll delve into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what implications it has for us as data professionals. We'll discuss SQL Server best practices that can help protect ourselves, our company, and the people whom we serve. We'll also dive into features in SQL Server that can help in this endeavor.
