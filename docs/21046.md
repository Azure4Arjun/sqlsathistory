## Title: SQL Server Table Partitioning from the ground up
## Abstract:
### In this session we will be looking at the SQL Server table partitioning features which were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  We will 

look at how to create partitioned tables and indexes as well as the internals of the table.  We will also look at how to move data 

from one partition to another and from one table to another with minimal to no impact to the users.
