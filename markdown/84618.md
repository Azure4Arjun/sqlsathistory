## Title: Mentoring Women in Tech:  A Guide for Men  Women Who Want to Help
## Abstract:
### Women make up less than 20% of the tech world and they're leaving the field at a rate over 3 times the rate that men are.  Women cite lack of effective mentorship as one of the leading reasons for their exodus.  Whether you're a colleague, a manager or someone who wants to change the status quo, your opportunity to effectively tip the scales changes.  

What do you do for a living, what level are you at in your career and are you in any kind of management role?  Can utilizing women's groups either at work or via a professional organization work for you? In this session, we'll discuss different ways you can mentor and sponsor women in tech.  We'll provide concrete steps you can take to mentor, sponsor or just offer support. These solutions vary based on who YOU are, where you are in your career, if you have hiring/promotion influence, etc.  Learn how you can make a difference.
