## Speaker: David Bojsen
## Title: Monitor your production line in real-time using Azure IoT Hub
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover end-to-end the creation of an IoT solution using Azure IoT Hub,
monitoring a (virtual) production line.
We will cover the concept of field gateways and talk about how to build a solution that is both fail-safe and can bring sensor processing close to the actual manufactoring, while still utilizing the massive power that the cloud can offer.
Expect a level 400 session with a lot of demos and code.
