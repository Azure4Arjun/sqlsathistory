## Title: SQL Server: Delivery and synchronizing of the data
## Abstract:
### In this session we are going to discuss different methods of the data delivery.
Why do we need them? In which cases should we use them?  
We will concern following technologies and definitions (cloud of tags): HA/DR, AlwayOn HAG, Replication, CDC, Log Shipping, Mirroring, Heterogeneous synchronization partners and, probably, something else :-)
In the demonstration we'll consider the one interesting example of using the Replication.
