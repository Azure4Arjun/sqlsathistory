## Title: Quickstart BI: Building a BI Solution in 5 Days
## Abstract:
### A Quickstart BI project is a 5-day engagement where we start with a set of real business data and then fast-track a solution using Microsoft BI tools like PowerPivot, Power View, BI Semantic Tabular Models, Multidimensional SSAS, SSRS, SharePoint, PerformancePoint and Excel Services.  Getting real business value in a few short days of investment is tricky.  Weâ€™ve done several of these for different organizations and learned some interesting lessons about tool choices, design best practices and project scope management.  Some of these projects were throw-away proof-of-concepts but many of them became the foundation for production-ready, decision-support solutions and executive dashboards.
