## Title: Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB
## Abstract:
### Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database. With the click of a button, Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's geographic regions. It offers throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees with comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs), something no other database service can offer.

In this session, we'll get an overview of Azure Cosmos DB. And we'll see live demos of Cosmos DB in action, including its multi-model capabilities using MongoDB and Gremlin APIs.
