## Speaker: Women in Technology Panel
## Title: Women in Technology (WIT) Panel Discussion
## Abstract:
### Why is technology a good career choice for women?  At first you may think, for the same reasons it's a good choice for a man.  If that's the case, then why are women either not entering or not staying in Technology?  Join us for a moderated discussion of all the reasons IT jobs work well for women, how to get them involved in tech and how to keep them in tech.  Attendees should expect an open, honest dialogue with a panel of women with many years experience in the Technology field.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions, offer solutions, talk about what's worked for them and hopefully walk away with the ability to offer women support  encouragement in regards to a successful career in IT.
