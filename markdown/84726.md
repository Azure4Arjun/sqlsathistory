## Title: Best Practices for Delivering  Sharing Content in Power BI
## Abstract:
### Power BI offers several ways to deliver and distribute content for internal colleagues and external users. In this session we will clarify when using the sharing functionality is appropriate, and techniques to effectively use My Workspace versus App Workspaces. We will discuss situations when a Power BI App becomes the optimal way to distribute content. We will also cover when to consider utilizing Power BI Premium, Power BI Embedded, or Power BI Report Server. You will leave this session with an understanding of options for collaboration and distribution of content in the context of personal BI, small teams, large teams, and enterprise-wide BI initiatives.
