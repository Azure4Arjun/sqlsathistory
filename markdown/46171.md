## Title: Word Up: Text Mining in SQL
## Abstract:
### Would a database by any other name smell as sweet? 

Our databases are filled with words. By mining our text for patterns and meanings, we can extract the emotional content, track changes over time, ferret out plagiarism, find common phrases and usage, and even predict future text.
