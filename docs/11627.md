## Title: Why APPLY?
## Abstract:
### Most T-SQL developers know that the APPLY operator can be used to invoke a table valued function. But did you know that it can also be used to join to derived data sets, return multiple columns from a sub-query, shred XML, create working columns for use with the WHERE and GROUP BY clauses, and replace the UNPIVOT operator? If not, then why not take your skills to the next level, and come see each use case in action, using real-world examples. You'll leave the session with thorough understanding of the full potential of this versatile operator, as well as a few new tricks up your T-SQL sleeves.
