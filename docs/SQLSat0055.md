# Database "Insecurity"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: David Moutray
## Title: Database "Insecurity"
## Abstract:
### We all know that database security is important.  Data is the lifeblood of modern business.  Moreover, Microsoft has given us tremendous tools for securing our databases at the database level.  Yet, how many database developers and database administrators use them?  How many understand them?  Database security is woefully neglected.  There are relatively few articles published on database security.  There are no new books on database security.  Compare this with the tremendous number of books, articles and conferences on Network Security.  Yet, our databases are vulnerable.  This is a call to action.

## Speaker: David Moutray
## Title: Database  Antipatterns
## Abstract:
### We've all seen them.  We've commiserated with one another about them over coffee at conferences and in blog sites.  Bad database design is much more common than good database design.  This discussion will cover a few of the most prominent "Antipatterns" common to database design today.

# SQL Design Patterns
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Jim Bears
## Title: SQL Design Patterns
## Abstract:
### atterns emerge as both templated solutions to recurring problems and designs, as well as provide useful ways to encapsulate complex ideas into smaller, friendlier terms. Patterns gained popularity in the object-orientated community since the Fowler and the Gang Of Four, but declarative languages, like SQL, have had little-to-no coverage of how these patterns can be applied. Understanding SQL design patterns is a crucial skill every SQL developer must learn and use in their career. SQL patterns can be applied to small projects or large, multi-million dollar systems, to provide common solutions to complex problems. Patterns create a foundation for "best practices" for SQL, Database Architecture, managers.

# Implementing Fine-grained Data Security
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Mark Stewart
## Title: Implementing Fine-grained Data Security
## Abstract:
### Data security presents a challenge for many groups in a company. Application requirements often specify different data content for various users, while those responsible for security recognize the need to limit access as much as possible.  Available options typically involve trade-offs in security, flexibility, and added work. SQL Server provides a number of security features, but row-level security is missing.  This session will consider some current architectural approaches to implementing flexible data security, and then examine a packaged solution for SQL Server to effectively customize row and column access for users without login accounts.

# Reading the SQL Server Execution Plan
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Reading the SQL Server Execution Plan
## Abstract:
### In this session we'll explain what the SQL Execution plan is, how the SQL Server generates it, and how to read the output.  This includes looking at the graphical as well as the XML version of the execution plan.  We'll explore the variety of operators that the execution plan can present you with, and show you how to tell the SQL Server that you want to change the execution plan to get rid of the operators that you don't want to be using any more.

# Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.

# Reducing the impact of database changes on an app
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Rajmund Rzepecki
## Title: Reducing the impact of database changes on an app
## Abstract:
### The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far.
 
My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.

# Performance Tuning with Traces
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#55-San-Diego-2010)
Event Date: 18-09-2010 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Tara Kizer
## Title: Performance Tuning with Traces
## Abstract:
### We'll touch on SQL Profiler and review its best practices so that you don't impact the production system while gathering data.  We'll take a deep dive into server-side traces (SQL Trace) and show how you can run a constant server-side trace with little impact on the production system.  We'll also examine the things that I look for when troubleshooting performance issues.

## Speaker: Troy Gatchell
## Title: Caching your data with Microsoft AppFabric
## Abstract:
### Take your system to the next level and scale highly read infrequently changed data with AppFabric today!  AppFabric (code named “Velocity”) has been released and is the latest high availability caching product from Microsoft.  Every database professional should understand this new technology as another tool in scaling their database systems.
