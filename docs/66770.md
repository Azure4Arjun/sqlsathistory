## Title: SQL Election: Which Tech is Faster?
## Abstract:
### Ever wondered what's faster between a bulk insert and BCP?  What about index seek vs index scan?  This session will review multiple topics of SQL Server that include development, ETL, and administration.  In the spirit of our recent election, this session will feature having the ability to debate and vote on which of each technology you think we will be best, and if your "candidate" wins, your votes will be entered into a drawing; so the more votes you win the more chances you get!
