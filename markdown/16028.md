## Title: Are users working against you? Manage human factors to achieve BI success
## Abstract:
### As new technology cycles emerge, we find ourselves immersed in a growing diversity of tools and infrastructures. Success in Business Intelligence, however, depends often on our capacity to increase adoption and is not always tied to the degree of engineering sophistication. 

Too often we experience adoption issues that account for partial or complete failures for BI delivery.  Are users satisfied with BI assets?  Do they continue to build information 'silos'?  Are they reluctant to change and utilize governed data sets?

In this presentation, attendees will learn about a perspective that can help increase ROI on BI delivery by actively targeting human factors critical to achieving success.
