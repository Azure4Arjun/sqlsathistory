## Speaker: Alex Yates
## Title: Database version control  deployment: model or migration scripts
## Abstract:
### There are fundamentally two ways to source control and deploy your databases. Either you source control the desired state/model and let software work out the upgrade scripts or you source control your upgrade scripts and run them in sequence.

Which is better? Well, that question has a tendency to divide the room.
 
I'm irritated whenever I go to a "how to do database DevOps" session and the speaker presents just one as "the right way", perhaps referring to the other as "the wrong way". Like most things, it depends.
 
I'll illustrate the limitations of each approach with a simple scenario. I'll describe which projects are better suited to a model or a migrations approach. I'll also discuss whether it's possible to get the best of both worlds.
