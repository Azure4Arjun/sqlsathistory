## Title: Well, actually...  An entertaining WIT session for the men
## Abstract:
### IT can be an inhospitable, isolated place for women  minorities. Women are leaving IT at 2.5x rate as men and are interrupted 3x as often. Our credentials are called into question.  We're called emotional or aggressive. We have our own job explained to us. People of color often can't get a call back on an application, regardless of how experienced they are.  Bias exists everywhere.  It's in our nature. 
 Sometimes it's subtle.  Other times it's overt. 
Most of the guys we work with are stand-up, respectable WIT allies.  There's always that one guy who ruins it for the rest of you. The problem is, you don't always notice when it happens.  Learn what those subtle forms of sexism  racism look like at work.  Learn how you can stop that guy in his tracks.  Learn how to not BE that guy, even when you're just trying to help.
