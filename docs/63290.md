## Title: SQL Server Internals - Binary (Stored) format of the data
## Abstract:
### There is a common confusion regarding "displayed format" and "stored format" of data using SQL Server. We can find lot of questions in the forums regarding "stored format" of dates, which are actually referring to the "displayed format", in external application. For example questions like: I am getting the error “DateTime data type resulted in an out-of-range value”, or questions like: “how can I change the DateTime column format in the database”.

In this session, we will explore how SQL Server actually stored the data behind the scene. 

We will read SQL Server data file directly using simple binary editor (notepad++), and we will explore the structure of several data types. We will focus on explore how DateTime2 data type is stored, which is probably one of the most common complex data type structure, and we will discuss other types in general (according to our time). During the demo, we are going to show and use several undocumented tools from different versions of SQL Server.
