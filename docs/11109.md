## Title: Data Quality Services--Finally!
## Abstract:
### Every organization that stores data stores dirty data, and suffers with how best to handle this unpleasant fact.Organizations must rely on people to deal with data problemseither by paying them to clean it or paying them to work around it. Either way it is costly and only becomes more so over time. Finally with the release of SQL Server 2012, there is a tool to help. Learn how to use the key parts of Data Quality Services: how to create a Knowledge Base, how to create Data Cleansing Projects to cleanse data both in the DQS client and inside SSIS 2012, and how DQS Matching Projects can integrate with Master Data Services for de-duplication of data. Session focuses on DQS, but also explains how DQS, MDS, and SSIS work together.
