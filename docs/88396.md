## Title: Practical SQL Server Internals for T-SQL Developers
## Abstract:
### Ever wonder how the SQL Server storage engine processes your T-SQL queries? Curious about what else you could be doing to improve query performance?

Having basic exposure to SQL Server Internals enables one to write more effective T-SQL. Join me as we peek into the black box of the storage engine. Topics will include an overview of the storage engine, indexing, and the query optimizer, accompanied by practical consequences and solutions.

When you leave, you will have a greater understanding of the storage engine and how to avoid T-SQL design patterns that negatively impact performance.
