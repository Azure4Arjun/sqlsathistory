## Title: T-SQL Best Practices
## Abstract:
### This presentation covers a number of different SQL Server T-SQL coding best practices. There will be a discussion around each best practice so attendees will better understand the rationale behind each. Some of the best practices will have a demo to showing how different coding styles arrive at the same answer while using different amounts of SQL Server resources (CPU, and I/O). These demos will help attendees better understand how poor coding practices produce sub-optimal execution plans.
