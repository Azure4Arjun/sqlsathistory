## Title: Real Time Autonomous Driving Data in Azure Databricks
## Abstract:
### Streaming and real-time data analysis are of great importance in many areas of industry. The simpler and more regular data can be analyzed by machines, the easier it is to identify problems or develop predictive models. This session uses Microsoft AirSim data, which is based on the Unreal Engine Simulator for autonomous vehicles. The AirSim data is sent in real time to a message broker (Azure Event Hub) and then processed using a fully managed Spark engine (Azure Databricks). Once Spark Streaming has processed the data, it can be accumulated and further analyzed.
