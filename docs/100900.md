## Speaker: Kelly Tabler
## Title: Data and DevOps: Joining the CI/CD Fun
## Abstract:
### For too long, data developers have been left in the dark on the power of DevOps. From creating entire new environments with infrastructure and configuration as code to maintaining consistency on existing systems with source control and automated builds and deployments, DevOps tools are as accessible to data platforms as to application developers. In this session, we will focus on the benefits and concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery with PowerBI. Using AzureDevOps, we will deal with maintaining reports in source control, triggering automated builds, and publishing to multiple environments.
