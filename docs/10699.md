### Learning a new technology can be a daunting task. This session is meant to help attendees, new to SQL Server, to get started.  We’ll start with an overview of the database engine and tools used to work with it.  These are tools that you’ll hear about throughout the rest of your day. We’ll introduce you to some key concepts as well. And go over some very basic database design fundamentals. We’ll also touch briefly on the BI side as well thanks to Stacia Misner. Finally we’ll provide some QA to help get your learning started down the right path.
