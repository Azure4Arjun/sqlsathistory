## Speaker: Ryan Yates
## Title: Using SharePoint as a Service Delivery Platform
## Abstract:
### Large organisations usually have their own dedicated Service Delivery IT platform for tracking and managing "Service Requests", but what happens in smaller organisations?
Without the right management tools and software, tracking and delivering service request resolutions can be a resource intensive task in itself and does not bode well for the quality of service to the end-user.

If your organisation has a SharePoint deployment, it doesn't have to be this way.

In this session we will utilise SharePoint's Out-Of-The-Box functionality and through a selection of customisations and technical know how, we will lay the foundations so that you may implement your own Service Delivery platform and enable your organisation to provide the type of efficient service delivery your end users expect.
