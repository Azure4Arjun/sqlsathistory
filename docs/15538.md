## Speaker: James Sampson
## Title: Visual Studio Productivity Tips and Tricks
## Abstract:
### Development in Visual Studio can either be slow as a rock, or fast as a cheetah. In this speech, I hope to be able to give some efficiency tips that have come to help me. I will touch base on some Visual Studio Extensions that are useful, Keyword usage, web.config transforms, deployment techniques â€“ with a side step into a Windows Azure deployment concern. This speech will be geared more towards introductory to intermediate developers, but I hope to be able to give everyone a couple of helpful tips they might not have known before.
