## Title: Integrating On-Premises Data with Azure-based Applications
## Abstract:
### Azure applications (PowerBI, Power Apps, AI  Machine Learning, etc) can greatly enhance business processes.

The problem therefore is: How can you use on-prem data sources with cloud-based (Azure) applications?

In this session, we will look at using an Azure On-Premises Data Gateway to integrate local (on-prem) data sources with Azure-based applications.
