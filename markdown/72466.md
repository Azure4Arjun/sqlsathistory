## Title: Making your Emergency DBA Toolkit
## Abstract:
### You’ve just been given a server that is having problems and you need to diagnose it quickly. This session will take you through designing your own toolkit to help you quickly diagnose a wide array of problems. We will walk through scripts that will help you pin point various issues quickly and efficiently. This session will take you through;

What’s on fire? – These scripts will help you diagnose what’s happening right now
Specs – What hardware are you dealing with here (you’ll need to know this to make the appropriate decisions)?
Settings – are the most important settings correct for your workload?
Bottlenecks – We’ll see if there are any areas of the system that are throttling us.
By the end of this session you should have the knowledge of what you need to do in order to start on your own kit. This kit is designed to be your lifeline to fix servers quickly and get them working.

All code we’ll go through is either provided as part of this presentation or are open source/community.
