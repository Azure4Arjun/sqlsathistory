## Title: Split, Merge and Eliminate - An Introduction to Partitioning
## Abstract:
### In my life as a Consultant, partitioning is one of the least used or even inefficiently used components of SQL Server that I have seen.  Partitioning provides many potential benefits such as easier index maintenance,  data loads and archiving using partition switching and improved query performance through partition elimination..
In this session we'll cover the basics of partitioning - from getting started with partition switching to partition elimination to make your queries go faster - with plenty of demos for you to take away.
