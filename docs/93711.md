## Title: Managing Packages in Integration Services (SSIS)
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) introduced the Catalog to help with managing project deployments, execution  monitoring. It was created to get rid of configuration files for packages in earlier versions. But what this has added is the ability to rollback a version, configure different environments as well as dashboard reports for monitoring.
This session will start with the installation and configuration of the catalog. The flow will change to the project management of packages. Here, project parameters will be used to configure different steps of a package and how this configuration can be shared with multiple packages. The project will be deployed as well as a single package deployment. The configuration will be changed at the SQL Server Agent Job and deployed project levels.  Environments will be setup to show development versus QA versus production. The report monitoring dashboard will conclude the session showing error messages as well as a package performance chart.
