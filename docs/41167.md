## Title: Analysing application performance with pattern searching using RML Utilitie
## Abstract:
### RML Utilities is a tool that will allow you to normalise the queries that your application sends to the database and do some deep analysis on them. We will find out how you can find patterns like finding all queries that touch a specific table. We will use read trace and automate getting the estimated query plan against a test database for the whole trace. We can even go through the list of parameters for one query and find the selectivity based no the statistics. (this all takes place on a test db, not on production). Do you use an ORM and can't tune individual queries because you have a lot of them and they're all fast? Use my technique to find patterns and tune your application in a way you've probably not thought of before.
