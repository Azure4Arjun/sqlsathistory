## Title: Applied Machine Learning with Python
## Abstract:
### The Applied Machine Learning with Python session covers some basic concepts, tools and a workflow used to explore, visualize, develop a model to attain answers from data. 

This is an introduction designed for those with minimal or no Machine Learning experience. It is also an applied session focused on getting answers from data, and it does not emphasize the Math behind the ML model. The examples leverage the Python programming language integration with SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services (In-Database).

Most importantly, those examples are designed in a manner that are easy to understand and to spur your future exploration, by making it possible for you to replicate and use it to expand your knowledge.
