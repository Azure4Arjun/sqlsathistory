## Title: How All-Flash Arrays Transform Database Operations and Engineering
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn how the performance and capabilities of next-generation all-flash arrays help you shave hours (and even days!) from your regular processes. Reduce your query execution times significantly. Take backups in minutes as opposed to hours. Initialize multi-terabyte replication subscribers in seconds. Rebuild indexes with confidence. Refresh Test/QA/Staging in seconds as opposed to weeks! AFAs really change the game. Come see for yourself, and challenge your notions around storage.
