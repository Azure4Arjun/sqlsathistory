## Title: Data Files and Transaction Logs -- beyond the GUIs
## Abstract:
### Performance of SQL Server poor? One cause may have been that starting file size that you didn't think was important because it will auto-grow. Why is auto-grow bad? Why shouldn't logs be auto-shrunk? Explore the physical structure of a database, how table structure effects use of memory and key mistakes to avoid. Additionally, dive into the transaction log process - VLFs, auto-recovery and lock escalation. Solid foundation for Programmers and Administrators!
