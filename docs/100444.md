## Title: Troubleshooting Power BI Report Performance
## Abstract:
### So you've built a Power BI report with all the shinies? Good! 
After some usage, users have reacted that it's a bit sluggish in usage, and they're not keen on using it anymore.

Starting off with the new Performance Analyzer Pane, we'll demonstrate how you can pinpoint bottlenecks in your report, and take actions on these insights.

With the myriad of root causes that are out there, an elimination approach might suit us very well. 
Some of the main causes will be explained, and we'll get you going on how you can fix it for yourselves.

Be it DAX-measures, modelling issues, or an overload of visuals. 
Every report can be tuned to handle like a dream, and you can do it too!
