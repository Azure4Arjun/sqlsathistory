## Title: Minimally Invasive - Tools to Doctor Up Your Code
## Abstract:
### This code filled session examines several additions to recent versions of SQL Server. These tools allow you to perform minimally invasive surgery on your code and gain performance! Learn how the APPLY operator works; iterate through incoming data just once with the MERGE statement; “slice and dice” your data with the Windowing (ranking) functions; re-write your multi-statement table-valued functions to inline functions to help the optimizer and speed up your queries; learn how to create a grouped delimited list – without loops!
