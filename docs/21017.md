## Title: Storage for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Storage can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to database performance.  It's also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we'll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We'll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as the storage configuration.
