## Title: Building Solutions for Power BI QA
## Abstract:
### QA is an amazing new feature of Power BI that allows you to ask you data question.  No longer do you have to write complex SQL queries to get results.  Simply type traditional English sentences to return interesting results about your data.  This session will walk through how to get a Power Pivot data model ready to use and also the end user experience of QA from the Power BI site.
