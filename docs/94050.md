## Title: Azure Automation with PowerShell: Scripting Away the Problems of Yesterday
## Abstract:
### In your day to day job, how many times do you find yourself interrupted to complete a task you've done a thousand times? The repetitive work not only takes resources from more important work but also costs time to ramp up/down. What if you could automate the operation? Better yet, what if you could give approved access to that automation to those that request it, execute it on a regular schedule, or have it react to some event? In this session, we will explore Microsoft's Azure Automation Runbooks, its capabilities, and even demo a few use-cases. This should give you a feel for how this service can help free you from tedious duties and empower the rest of your team!
