## Title: Hardening SQL Server in a legacy environment
## Abstract:
### Do you have a lot of legacy applications using your SQL servers? Do you still have to run older versions of SQL server, because the app vendors are slow to upgrade? Are you rightfully worried that one day, you too will suffer a malicious attack on your precious data?

This session covers the essentials on starting to harden your SQL servers so they can have a much better chance of withstanding attacks - such as the currently popular Ransom Ware wave.

We will be looking at the basic strategies of keeping your backups truly safe, how to successfully monitor for anomalies, and also how to incrementally implement basic in transit encryption (IPSEC).
