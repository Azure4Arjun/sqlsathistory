## Speaker: Brandon Tucker
## Title: Lessons Learned: Hurricane Sandy
## Abstract:
### In the life of a DBA, we rarely get to experience an actual disaster. And by “actual disaster”, we aren’t just talking about an UPDATE without a WHERE clause on a live table. At the end of October 2012, Hurricane Sandy ravaged much of the New Jersey/New York area, causing business impacts up and down the Eastern seaboard. In this talk, I’ll share experiences from my first disaster, covering what went well, what didn’t, and what we’ve put into place since to help in the future.
