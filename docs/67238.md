## Title: Introduction to Azure Data Lake and U-SQL for SQL users
## Abstract:
### Data Lakes have become a new tool in building modern data warehouse architectures. In this presentation we will introduce Microsoft's Azure Data Lake offering and its new big data processing language called U-SQL that makes Big Data Processing easy by combining the declarativity of SQL with the extensibility of C#.   We will give you an initial introduction to U-SQL by explaining why we introduced U-SQL and showing with an example of how to analyze some tweet data with U-SQL and its extensibility capabilities and take you on an introductory tour of U-SQL that is geared towards existing SQL users.
