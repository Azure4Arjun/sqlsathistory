## Title: Performance Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) servers need continued maintenance and monitoring post deployment to production; however, many projects forgo this part and the overall system performance can suffer. 

Join this session to learn how to monitor and evaluate the performance of your SSAS server. You will learn what to measure and how to determine acceptable ranges of those measurements for your environment. You will see demos of Task Manager, Perfmon and SQL Server Extended Events to get insights into your SSAS serverâ€™s health, identify the most common issues in production, and make recommendations for changes to SSAS developers on your team.

If you have experience with SSAS development and are interested in learning about SSAS from the server side, this session is for you.  This session focuses on SQL Server Analysis Services in multidimensional mode but many of the concepts apply to tabular mode as well.
