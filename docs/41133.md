## Title: Wheaton's Law for Technology Pros: Level up your customer service
## Abstract:
### DBAs (and IT folk in general) have a terrible reputation for being stubborn, jerky curmudgeons. These guys exist, and working with them is a miserable experience--but they're a minority. Unfortunately, they are a memorable minority and they give the rest of us a bad name.

It can be hard to enforce the rules, do what's best for your environment, and offer outstanding customer support. It can be tough--rules mean telling people no. Rules mean making decisions that might make some people unhappy. In this session, we'll talk about some of these challenges and how to deal with them, all while obeying Wheaton's Law.
