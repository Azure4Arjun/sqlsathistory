## Title: Bottling Up Your Data Lake with Delta Lake Tables
## Abstract:
### Data engineering architectures in recent years have been centralized around large cloud Data Lakes like Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob, S3, and HDFS. These Data Lakes have provided organizations with cheap and easy to use storage of critical and sometimes... very inconsistent data. 

Using Delta Lake, in tandem with Azure Databricks, we'll walkthrough bottling your Azure Data Lake data into clean, validated, and consumable tables for personas from Business Analysts to Data Scientists. All without changing where you keep your data!
