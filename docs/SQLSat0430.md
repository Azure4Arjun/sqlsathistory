## Speaker: Leonard Lobel
## Title: Introduction to Azure DocumentDB
## Abstract:
### Azure DocumentDB is a new highly-scalable NoSQL database platform on Microsoft Azure, designed as a fully managed cloud service for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports schema-free designs, and scales across replicas with fast write performance and eventual consistency. But DocumentDB also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios, which you will learn about in this session. The platform is based on HTTP/REST, embraces JSON as a standard document format, and is supported by a wide range of SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and Node.js. Without defining any index paths, new documents are queryable within milliseconds, using SQL grammar or LINQ. Learn these and other capabilities, including server-side JavaScript-based stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, tunable consistency, and more.

## Title: Azure Data Factory vs SSIS, the Ins and Outs.
## Abstract:
### ADF provides a managed way to orchestrate the collection, movement and transformation of structured and semi-structured data together. It works both with on-premises and cloud data and it has - of course - a powershell interface, enabling you to manage it without the bling of the Azure portal. But is it useful, is it fast, is it easy and powerful to use ? And most of all is Azure Data Factory  the new SSIS ?
These are some of the questions that might arise, when reading about this new PaaS and that we will answer together in this demo packed session where will we go through orchestration, consumption and administration of data through the ADF pipeline.

## Title: The top 8 reasons for your transaction performance problems
## Abstract:
### Transaction is running slow! How many times you have seen this on your production system, how many times you heard have this from your users? It’s time to isolate issues and get them resolved!
There are common reasons for transaction delays like slow transaction log, page splits, blocking, over-indexing, and even some configuration settings of your database and/or instance. Query tuning tips are slightly different than those for transactions, this session is about OLTP performance troubleshooting. I will show you some typical scenarios of transaction delays and the reasons behind them. This will definitely help you in your performance troubleshooting efforts and will give you a good level of confidence.
