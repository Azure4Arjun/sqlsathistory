## Speaker: Allan Hirt
## Title: Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR
## Abstract:
### These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.
