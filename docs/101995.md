## Speaker: Ken Puls
## Title: M Is For Data Monkeys
## Abstract:
### One of the things we love about Power Query is that you can do amazing things with just a few button clicks. But did you know that behind the scenes, Power Query performs Magic via a coding language called M? In the perfect world, you’d never need to look at this code at all but – as with all coding languages – you can do much more if you’re willing to get your hands dirty.

In this session Ken will provide some simple M tricks to do amazing things. Building a calendar table in seconds, numbering grouped rows, and speeding up a table with a little buffer action.
