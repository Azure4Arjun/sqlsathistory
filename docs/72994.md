## Title: Developing AI applications using CNTK Deep Learning
## Abstract:
### While human-like deductive reasoning, inference, and decision-making by a computer is still a long time away. But, there have been remarkable gains in the application of AI techniques and associated algorithms when used to solve real-world problems. One such AI technique that can be leveraged effectively to solve problems is Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by, and partially modeled on biological neural networks called artificial neural networks. 
The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is a free, easy-to-use, open-source, commercial-grade toolkit that trains deep learning algorithms to learn like the human brain. This session is meant to explain high level concepts of AI, deep learning, and neural networks using CNTK at a level that can be understood by most non-practitioners.
