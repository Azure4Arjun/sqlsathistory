## Title: Managing Database Changes in Source Control
## Abstract:
### There are a number of challenges while collaborating on database development. When someone in a team changes database objects in a shared database, another team member may overwrite those changes. This will lead to the valid changes and data loss. The best way to resolve such challenges is to start using database version control. In this session, we will talk about the source control basics, and also have a look at how to start source controlling your SQL Server databases.
