Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Jacob Appleton
## Title: Get Control of your Database Development with SQL Server Database Projects
## Abstract:
### Is your database development process as mature, automated and repeatable as your other code development processes? Do you have source control, builds, unit tests and automated deployments as part of your database software development lifecycle? Or instead, do you have some change scripts saved somewhere and rely on your DBAs to hit F5 on the correct scripts in the correct database?

The client services IT team at Orbis is coming to the end of an ambitious project to refactor a large legacy codebase. Like many organisations, we had a lot of business logic in our database layer and didn't have much of a software development lifecycle process to keep it under control. 

This talk will demonstrate the process we took to implement SQL Server Data Tools Database Projects, how that enabled us to get control of our database development, and how easy it is for you to start getting control of your database development too.

## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: Big Data for the SQL Ninja
## Abstract:
### As more enterprises start implementing big data solutions, how does the DBA support these efforts and do they have the skills and knowledge to integrate big data solutions into your current architecture and processes? This demo-filled session has two purposes; first, to help DBAs understand how to apply their existing SQL Server skills in understanding and utilizing HDInsight and related technologies. Big data technologies don’t need to be intimidating, and this session will help DBAs see how they can easily apply their current skill when working with big data. Second, this session will show how SQL Server and HDInsight be used together to create solutions to solve big data problems without the complexities of massive learning curves and using technologies DBAs are already familiar with. We’ll look at technologies that make working with big data much less daunting, including HiveQL and Sqoop, both of which don’t require a rocket science degree to use.

Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker: Ken Puls
## Title: Optimizing desktop Power Pivot models using Power Query
## Abstract:
### You know the scene; you’ve built a beautiful Power Pivot model that has solved all of your organization’s problems.  You open it up, click Refresh and wait patiently for all the data to stream in.  That’s okay, there’s a lot of data and you expect that.  Then you click a slicer and… wait…
Time during the initial data load is one thing, but consumer’s patience during use is another.  Their tolerance for latency is much less.
In this session we’ll explore the things you can do to increase your Power Pivot model performance.  We’ll look at the key factors that affect performance, as well as the things you can do to deal with them.  In addition, we’ll look at how sourcing your data with Power Query can give you ultimate control over your data’s size and shape, and tricks to optimize it for Power Pivot consumption.

Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Julie Koesmarno
## Title: 10 Handy Tips On SQL Server Dates
## Abstract:
### Are you working with an application supporting different time zones and international date formats? How does your choice of storing date / time values differ if you are using Windows Azure SQL Database instead of on-prem SQL Server database? Did you know that SQL Server Database Engine, Integration Services (SSIS) and Analysis Services (SSAS) all have slightly different date / time data types? How can you bullet proof your system for the ever growing data in your organization with much more date and time data to come?  
 
With time being the one thing that constantly changes, date and time calculations are widely used and essential to all business transactions. Yet, most systems only use one or two date data types; Is this a wise decision? Quite often data retrieval relating to a period of time does performs poorly, or worst of all, is not accurate. These 10 tips will help you bridge the gap, and provide the techniques to build bulletproof systems the users demand and DESERVE!

# SQL Server Mythconceptions and Mythteries
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-407)
Event Date: 27-06-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Robert Davis
## Title: SQL Server Mythconceptions and Mythteries
## Abstract:
### There are a lot of misconceptions and mysteries in SQL Server due in large part to there be no single right answer for just about any question you have. How many times have you heard, ‘It Depends’ as the answer to a complex SQL Server question?  So often that it has almost become a joke.  When it’s your SQL Server, it’s no joke.

Why won't that query go parallel? Why won't the optimizer use that index? Why did rebuilding that index improve performance 10 times over?

Sometimes misconceptions become accepted as fact, and they spread. Occasionally, these mistold tales come from very reliable sources. It can be extremely difficult to tell what is fact and what is fable.

In this session, we will explore some of these misconceptions and mysteries turned myths and bust out the truth. We will prove the right answer and free you from these myths that have taken on a life of their own.

## Speaker: Scott Klein
## Title: Windows Azure SQL Database for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed, scalable service based on SQL Server technology. Yet “fully-managed” does not necessarily mean that many or all of the tasks and responsibilities of the DBA are managed and executed by Microsoft or the service itself. The DBA is very crucial in Windows Azure SQL Database, and this session will take a look at the all-important role of the DBA when working with Windows Azure SQL Database. This session will look at how many of the on-premises functions, tasks, and responsibilities of the DBA are accomplished in a cloud environment, specifically Windows Azure SQL Database.  This session will also look at the tips, tricks, and best practices a DBA should know for accomplishing similar on-premises tasks in the cloud.

## Title: Hardware for Nothing, Get Your Flash for Free—Optimized Data Center Econ
## Abstract:
### SQL Server licensing is complex— expensive.  Consolidating on Flash provides savings of hundreds of thousands *per server*. A contemporary commodity two-socket server costs around $10K; SQL licenses for that server cost $200K to $300K or more. An idle CPU isn't doing nothing—it's burning money. You paid for your licenses, learn how to leverage them fully by leveraging Flash.  Whether upgrading to leverage the latest--greatest SQL Server features or to maintain support owing to the Windows Server 2003  SQL Server 2005 EOL events, or consolidating strictly for economics, learn about real-life examples in which SanDisk has collaborated with our customers to save up to millions— learn how you can educate your engineers  CxO's so you can do the very same thing. Doing so not merely covers your server  Flash hardware budget, you'll have piles of money left over—and an even bigger pile when you stop paying for SAN maintenance. Standardize to optimize!

## Speaker: Todd McDermid
## Title: Paying Down Technical Debt - Consolidating Data Marts
## Abstract:
### Technical debt creeps in to every project - One form of technical debt I've had to attack recently was a runaway group of data marts.  As the first marts were created, they were truly independent.  Keeping projects independent allowed implementation teams to work in parallel.  In some cases, new projects leveraged existing marts and built upon them.  Unfortunately, this went on too long without coordination.  There are now tens of marts with unknown dependencies between them, and significant duplication of data.  Further development is paralyzed by fear of unknown consequences, but increasing data volumes require change to meet SLA windows.
So how do you get from spaghetti code to a more manageable Kimball style Data Warehouse Bus?  Simple tools within SQL Server (views and schemas) partnered with conforming ETL to consistent practices are getting us there.  Come see what we're doing that works - and share some of your own successes too!

## Title: Introduction to Policy Based Management
## Abstract:
### Many of the things a DBA needs to monitor on a regular basis can be performed with Policy Based Management. Mistakes made by junior DBAs or developers who don’t understand the database policies can be caught and prevented with Policy Based Management. As a built-in feature in SQL Server, Policy Based Management is often overlooked. Learn about policies, facets, and conditions. With more demo than slides, this session will show you what you need to know to get started with Policy Based Management in your organization. By the end of this session you will have a solid understanding of what Policy Based Management is, when you should use it, and how to use it appropriately. This session is also a good prep for some material in the 70-462 Administering Microsoft SQL Server exam.

## Title: Why I can't adopt Power BI
## Abstract:
### File under "life after Microsoft" and "lessons learned". After spending time on the product development team, Power Pivot and the other tools in the Power BI stack hold a special place in my heart. I've tried using them in the real world and run into some serious adoption blockers. I will give an example end-to-end Power BI application that wound up getting mothballed and give a project post-mortem. I will also talk through user education, licensing, support, upgrade, and other considerations that make it hard for me to love Power BI.

# RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.

## Title: RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.
## Abstract:
### I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.
