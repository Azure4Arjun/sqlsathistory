## Title: Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis
## Abstract:
### Using Wait Types and Response Time Analysis is a proven methodology for tuning SQL Server instances and applications. However, there is often confusion on exactly what the data represents. The issue typically centers around the fact the response time data is analyzed at the wrong level and is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server wait types coupled with response time analytics to solve the most difficult performance issues. If you are a DBA or Developer you will definitely benefit from having this methodology in your toolbox.
