Event Date: 27-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Database Health and Performance
## Abstract:
### Sure, your SQL Server is up and running. Is it healthy? Is it performing the best that it can? Where are your performance bottlenecks? In an emergency, can you objectively demonstrate where a performance problem lies? This dynamic dialog session will present a solid process for checking your environment's overall health and performance levels as well as solutions for common problems. Some of the items focused on include dynamic management views (DMVs), Windows Perfmon, and disk performance tools such as IOMeter and SQLIO.

# Data Mining Deep Dive: Clustering
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-175)
Event Date: 27-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Eric Ness
## Title: Data Mining Deep Dive: Clustering
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server makes it simple to apply data mining algorithms to a wide variety of data.  Applying the results to business decisions without a thorough understanding of how the algorithms work is dangerous to the bottom line of the business, though.  This session will take one of the algorithms, the Microsoft Clustering Algorithm, and do a deep dive into the mechanics of how it works.  The algorithm is valuable for analyzing data in the fields of marketing, social networks and many others.  The session will also examine the types of data that are valid for clustering.  A demonstration of building a clustering model using SQL Server Analysis Services and viewing the model using the Excel Data Mining Add-In will be given.

# Discovering the Plan Cache
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-175)
Event Date: 27-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Speaker: Jeff Prom
## Title: Data Quality Services
## Abstract:
### As the old adage goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' Stop spending hours manually cleansing your data, and start using DQS! DQS is the new data 
quality tool provided with SQL Server 2012. By leveraging knowledge bases, you can correct invalid data and improve the quality of your data.

In this session we will cover creating a knowledge base, data cleansing, data matching, and using 3rd party knowledge bases (Reference Data). We will talk about installation, show how to use the DQS tool, and how to integrate DQS into your SSIS packages. After this session you should have a good understanding of what DQS is, how to use it, and how to get started with your own Data Quality initiative.

# An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL 
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-175)
Event Date: 27-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 2
## Speaker: Paul Timmerman
## Title: An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL 
## Abstract:
### Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!
