## Title: Demystifying NUMA and RightSizing
## Abstract:
### One of the most misunderstood aspects of virtual machine performance is vNUMA. In addition to an overview on the CPU architecture, NUMA and CPU scheduling; we'll discuss some nuances of the CPU that are not commonly known. We will deep dive into how a single VM's misconfiguration can cause performance problems for itself and also how many misconfigured VMs degrade the norm of performance of your virtual infrastructure.  
DBAs will be taught to identify misconfigured virtual machines and be explained what the infrastructure engineer can do to resolve it. 
The presentation will be completed with a discussion on virtual machine RightSizing and how it benefits the larger virtual infrastructure.
