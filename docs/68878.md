## Title: Data Science with SQL Server 2016 and R
## Abstract:
### One of the most notable additions to the Microsoft BI stack is the addition of Microsoft R Server inside SQL Server 2016. The inbuilt ScaleR packages deliver scalability and multithreading capabilities that open-source R canâ€™t easily provide, opening up a world of possibilities for data scientists interested in machine learning and predictive analytics. But what does this look like on a Microsoft platform?

Oliver Frost, a Data Science Engineer at Direct Line Group, demonstrates what tools are available to you as a data scientist inside SQL Server 2016. Discover how R adds value where traditional relational databases struggle, how to use ScaleR functions to build predictive models and efficient machine learning pipelines.
