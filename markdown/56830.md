## Title: Building a Data Warehouse for the DBA
## Abstract:
### Users want Data Warehouses built, but no one ever builds one for the DBA. Let#39;s fix that!

Get information from Active Directory, your Windows Servers, SQL Servers and other sources that mean something and will help you to keep the databases running smoothly. Be able to see which disks/machines are low on disk, what databases are on which SQL Servers, when backups happened and if any jobs failed.

This is targeted at the DBA who is responsible for multiple SQL Servers, in multiple places, and doesn#39;t have time to quot;point and clickquot; their way to a comfortable understanding of the moving pieces on all of the systems that they need to monitor!

NOTE: This session covers how to BUILD the warehouse, how to collect information and store it in relational tables in a way that makes sense as a warehouse. I#39;m developing a follow on session that presents the collected data using BI tools.
