## Title: Understanding U-SQL
## Abstract:
### With so many languages around to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize data, Microsoft introduced yet another language : U-SQL.  In this session, we#39;ll take a look at what U-SQL is, what it brings to the table, and how it differs from (or overlaps with) the existing constructs (T-SQL, SQL CLR, DAX/MDX, PowerQuery/M, R etc.,).  We#39;ll go over step-by-step in getting started with U-SQL, and review some use case scenarios.
