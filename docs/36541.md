## Title: Continuous Integration for Databases
## Abstract:
### Building software is hard, and we often find that fixing bugs is expensive if they are not caught early. Continuous Integration has proven to be a valuable technique in improving software quality by finding problems quickly and letting developers know immediately they have introduced a bug.This session demonstrates how you can implement CI for SQL Server databases, execute automated tests against your code and inform developers that they have caused a problem immediately.
