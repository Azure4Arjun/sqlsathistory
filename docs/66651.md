## Title: Working with JSON in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### One of the many exciting new features in SQL Server 2016 is the suite of JSON functions, which allow for querying JSON text and generating JSON text from tabular data. This session will explore these new capabilities from a BI perspective. You'll learn how to load JSON text into SQL Server with SSIS, and how the new JSON functions facilitate the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) or schema on read pattern.
