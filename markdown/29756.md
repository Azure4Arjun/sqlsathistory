## Title: SSIS Done Right With Package Configurations
## Abstract:
### Everyone starts creating SSIS Packages the same way. We hard code connection strings, file locations, etc. Package Configurations are a powerful way to control your packages at run time. This allows you to seamlessly move packages between servers, dynamically assign data sources and destinations, cycle through data sources, and create reusable code. 

In this presentation, Iâ€™ll demonstrate an easy to understand three step process which you can use with all of your packages to increase your productivity in SSIS.
