## Title: Looking through the Windshield: Forward-looking Dashboards  KPIs
## Abstract:
### It is dangerous to drive forward while looking through the rear window. The same is true about guiding our organizations forward while looking only at the past. Yet, much of our BI shows only the past. This session explores simple techniques to make our dashboards and KPIs visualize what is likely in the future. No fancy predictive algorithms are necessary – just an appreciation of what we know about our organization’s future and a recognition of past trends that are likely to continue. Examples are provided in Power BI, SSRS Paginated Report and SSRS Mobile reports.
