## Title: An Introduction To Big Data For The SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### The boss comes to you and says that he wants to implement big data technologies into your environment. Is this the end of your career with SQL Server? Where do you start learning about this rapidly changing world of big data? 

This presentation will answer all those questions, and will introduce you to the concepts that are the driving force behind a move to utilize "big data" technologies. It will introduce you to some of the key vendors and tools that are the most recognized today, which can help get a SQL Server DBA working on these systems very quickly. During the presentation we will cover those scenarios where big data technologies can be helpful, where they really just don't fit, and why.  

Finally, there will be an introduction on how Azure is playing a significant role in this move, and how this could potentially benefit you in your environment.  

So, come with an open mind, and be prepared to get excited about what a future with big data might hold for you!
