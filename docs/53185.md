## Title: Basics of Azure Machine Learning
## Abstract:
### The Azure Machine Learning workspace is an easy to use, visual way of doing machine learning, however, it is also very powerful and a great tool to use to start with Machine Learning. Initially it can be a bit overwhelming to figure out how exactly to go about using it to get some results. We will give a basic introduction to machine learning, the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a demo on how to get your first model running in a few minutes as well as some of the functionality offered in this great and quickly evolving tool.
