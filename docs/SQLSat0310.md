## Speaker: Leonard Lobel
## Title: Learning Entity Framework 6
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has clearly positioned the Entity Framework 6 (EF) as the primary data access platform for .NET applications. But many developers have yet to embrace the powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities that EF offers. Whether you’re new to ORM, or you’ve dabbled in other ORM technologies, Lenni will show how quickly you can start working with EF6 and boost your productivity when building data-centric .NET applications.

We’ll begin with a quick introduction to ORM and EF, and then explain many of the special ORM features in EF6, such as the Entity Data Model, and table splitting, inheritance, entity splitting, and many-to-many relationships. With the basics covered, Lenni will then dive right into live demos that show what EF can do for you as a data access layer, using database-first, model-first, and code-first approaches with both direct SQL and stored procedures. We’ll also discuss new features introduced in EF6, and show how to use EF in N-Tier scenarios.

## Speaker: Daire Cunningham
## Title: Using Power BI and SharePoint as a rapid development BI Strategy
## Abstract:
### See how you can use Excel and SharePoint to quickly implement a BI solution with Power BI. The Power BI tools allow you to extract, transform and load your data (Power Query), model that data (Power Pivot) and visualise the resulting analyses (Power View and Power Map) all within Excel. The results can be shared simply in the cloud with Office365 SharePoint Online. If you’re ready for the next level you can migrate your model to SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise or stick with the cloud using Azure Virtual Machines.
