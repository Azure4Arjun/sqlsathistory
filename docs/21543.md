## Title: Data Explorer - The future of selfservice ETL
## Abstract:
### Data Explorer is an Information Worker focused ETL Tool integrated in Excel 2013. We will show this cool new tool to mash up data from different data sources (from Facebook to ODATA, from SQL Server to Files in a table). We will show in many live demos transformations and will go into the formular engine and possibilities for using it with PowerPivot and PowerView as an output.
