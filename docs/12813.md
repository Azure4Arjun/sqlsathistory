## Title: Demystifying PowerPivot from the SharePoint Admin 
## Abstract:
### Demystifying PowerPivot from the SharePoint Admin Perspective. PowerPivot can be a maddening undertaking to the SharePoint Admin. We'll walk through the basic architecture of PowerPivot within SharePoint. Then we'll setup an actual working PowerPivot and store it in SharePoint. We'll also walk through setting up the PowerPivot Refresh. Along the way David will share anecdotes, tips  hints, SharePoint war stories, and the occasional movie quote.
