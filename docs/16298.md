## Speaker: Jeffrey Garbus
## Title: Rewriting Bad Code 
## Abstract:
### This session consists of real-life examples of poorly performing t-sql code and what was done to improve performance by several orders of magnitude. Jeff will cover a variety of performance topics from misuse of tempdb, to excessive io, to taking advantage of new t-sql features. These examples are also featured in his most recent (and well-reviewed) book, "Microsoft Transact - SQL, The Definitive Guide".
