## Title: CUBE-functions for fun  profit
## Abstract:
### CUBE-functions are a little understood and seldomly used feature of Excel, but they have tremendous power for creating high-impact, custom reports that donâ€™t look like pivottables at all. In this demo-rich presentation we start out by giving an introduction to what they actually do, then dive right into how to make them work for us. In the end we will investigate their use with Excel Services, Powerpivot Services and PowerBI.
