# Don’t Miss Out on Excel Cube Functions
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#236---St.-Louis-2013)
Event Date: 07-09-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: BI
## Speaker: Meagan Longoria
## Title: Don’t Miss Out on Excel Cube Functions
## Abstract:
### Cube functions have existed since Excel 2007, but they’re not as well known nor as well publicized as other methods to obtain data from Analysis Services/PowerPivot sources. Business Analysts may feel confined to tabular (symmetrical) reports with pivot tables. BI Developers may avoid Excel because they want the ability to write calculations in MDX and the extensive formatting capabilities of Reporting Services. And Power View limits you to the sets, calculations, and captions available in the data source and doesn’t provide drillthrough detail. We’ll start with the basics of how to write and use cube functions, then employ them to build a nicely formatted, asymmetrical, parameter-driven report that overcomes the previously noted limitations. In addition to facilitating new methods for data retrieval and report design, learning cube functions can help business analysts understand the MDX language and BI developers appreciate the power of Excel’s formulas and formatting options.

## Title: Management Studio Features for Working Less and Getting More Done
## Abstract:
### As SQL Server Professionals we spend countless hours inside a single tool - Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - yet odds are you don't know of some of the enhancements that exist inside Management Studio that provide you with the ability to re-use code, parameterize frequently-run scripts, and store all these scripts right at your fingertips.  In this session Tim will dive into some of the less familiar areas of SSMS and give you ideas on how you can work less... and get more accomplished.

## Title: Moving Enterprise database to cloud
## Abstract:
### Windows Azure provides several different ways of storing and managing data. Windows Azure SQL Database and SQL Server in Windows Azure Virtual Machines are solutions in Windows Azure for working with relational data. If you are familiar with SQL Server, Windows Azure SQL Database will be a natural extension of your knowledge and skills. 
In this session, you will learn: 
1)	Windows Azure SQL Database - Learn how to get started. We will explore how to migrate an existing on-premise SQL Server database to Windows Azure SQL Database. We will then walk through how to manage and administer your Windows Azure SQL servers and databases. 
2)	 Provision the SQL Server VM on Windows Azure - We will learn provisioning the Virtual Machine through the Windows Azure Management Portal. Once created, we will open the VM through the Remote Desktop . Finally, we will connect to SQL server  using SSMS.
