## Title: Deploying SQL 2016 with PowerShell DSC
## Abstract:
### If you need a dependable way to deploy SQL time after time, Powershell DSC provides methods for customizing deployments based on the type of role the Database server will take in your environment. Even though the SQL installer already has a script builder for automating installs, by using PowerShell DSC and community resources  you may either push or pull a deployment to a full gui or core server.
