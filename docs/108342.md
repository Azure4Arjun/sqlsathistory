## Title: External Tools for Power BI, how to create them!
## Abstract:
### Power BI offers an add-in to work with 3rd party external tools like Tabular Editor, DAX Studio and ALM toolkit. The fact that you can use a tool of your own preference is already really cool! But did you know that you can build these tools yourself pretty easy? 

In this session I will show you how I build my model documentation external tool and how you can start doing this yourself!
