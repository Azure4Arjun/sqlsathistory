## Title: Tally 'Em Up
## Abstract:
### Database administrators as a rule hate Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) solutions due to how poorly they perform in T-SQL. Sometimes, though, it seems as though we need to make do and take that performance hit. This presentation will show you that the humble tally table can eliminate RBAR-dependency across a number of different problem spaces, including splitting text, validating dates, and even reporting on errors. With plenty of examples, you'll get to see exactly how powerful a tally table can be.
