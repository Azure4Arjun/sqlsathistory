## Title: SQL Server 2016 CTP 3 review
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is coming bringing a lot of new innovations. During this session we will have a look at some of them, including: always encrypted (great think if you want to keep sensitive data encrypted at all times with ability to query), row-level security (finally, DBAs can apply fine-grained access control to table rows), temporal database support (yes, you can query data as points in time), and operational analytics (architecture to run analytics queries concurrently with operational workloads using the same schema). Stay ahead of the game!
