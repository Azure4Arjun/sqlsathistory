## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Common TSQL Mistakes
## Abstract:
### We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too, some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I have given this talk nearly a dozen times now and it is always very highly rated!
