## Title: Automating Database Restores
## Abstract:
### Beginning DBA's think of a RESTORE as something that gets done when something goes wrong. In practice we restore all the time, perhaps most often to refresh our QA and Development environments. Doing one restore isn't hard, but what about when you get five or ten requests a day? It's not just the restore either, you have to alter permissions, change the recovery model, set the database owner, perhaps update synonyms or mask out sensitive data. Restores are a pattern and if we see the pattern, we can do things to make it faster and repeatable.

This presentation will show you the latest version of the system I use, one consisting of a couple of tables and a couple of Powershell scripts. I'll start with my design goals, show you some of the compromises I made to get to a solution that handles 90% or so of the requests, and some of the options I thought about but decided against. I used Powershell, but  it's a pattern you could solve using another language, even perhaps TSQL!
