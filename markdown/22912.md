## Title: Battle of the Finch Bots
## Abstract:
### Robots, SQL, Twitter and games!  In an ongoing battle across SQL Saturdays, our two Finch bots RGPDEV (represents developers) and RGPDBA (represents DBAs) will compete against each other. You the audience will help determine the winner of the finch bot race by voting real time on twitter for your favorite robot.  After all games are over we will use the data collected by the finch bots to select 4 participants to advance to a cyber boxing tournament to win a finch bot.
