## Title: GDPR: How it impacts companies outside of Europe
## Abstract:
### GDPR takes (took) effect on May 25th, 2018. Many companies  have overlooked the implication of GDPR because they think it only affects customers in Europe.  However, GDPR impacts any company that captures any personally identifiable information for any EU Member. So, if there's a chance that you are collecting information from someone who is a citizen of any other EU Country, you are impacted. In this session, we will discuss all of the ways that you may be impacted and the steps you should be taking to become compliant before the fines start being collected.
