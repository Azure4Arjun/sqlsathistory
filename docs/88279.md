## Title: AzureVM + Log Shipping + Automation = Bargain Basement DR Solution (How To)
## Abstract:
### Operating on a budget can result in some creative solutions. Recently I've come up with a creative solution for traditional on-premise client-server solutions that allows for full redundancy in the cloud, but at a budget price. This is accomplished through VMs, copying of logs to Blob Storage, automation of hydration, updates  de-allocation.  It may be a bit of a Rube Goldberg machine, but it works! The result is an extremely pro-rated and affordable DR solution that is within 1 hour or less of production in restorability. Come to this session to learn more about the hurdles faced when putting this solution together and to brainstorm together how it can even be improved.
