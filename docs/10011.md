## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Sets and Relations and Queries, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### Let's get back to the basics - we'll talk about basic SQL and how set theory and the relational model are fundamental to building solid queries that do what you want and perform well, too.  We'll look at simple queries as well as some more complex ones, how SQL Server satisfies those queries and why set-based logic will give your applications superior performance. This session will provide an introduction to Transact-SQL as well as some looks behind the curtain to see how things really work.
