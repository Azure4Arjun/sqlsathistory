## Speaker: Bent Pedersen
## Title: Hybrid BI
## Abstract:
### With the introduction of SQL 2016 and all its new features, Hybrid BI is more in focus then ever. Doing BI is no longer bound to be on-premise or in the cloud. With all the new features and the Azure platform Microsoft has made it easier then ever to implement a hybrid platform.

When working with a hybrid platform your organisation will be able to select strategy and features based on the highest ROI. During this session I will go through three different aspects of Hybrid BI which is infrastructure, data-storage and reporting. 

As part of this i will go through the advantages and disadvantages of each area to supply you with the information you need to choose the right direction for your platform.
