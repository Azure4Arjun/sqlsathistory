# AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#104---Colorado-Springs-2012)
Event Date: 07-01-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jim Murphy
## Title: AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!
## Abstract:
### In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.

# Discovering the Plan Cache
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#104---Colorado-Springs-2012)
Event Date: 07-01-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA
## Speaker: Jason Strate
## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Speaker: Michael Sexton
## Title: ETL as MDM
## Abstract:
### Companies store data in multiple diverse formats on multiple databases using multiple versions of software and none of it is designed to integrate of work together… until that it gets to the BI systems. In the BI system data suddenly must – as if by magic - become a fully integrated and logically coherent system to generate reports for executives.  This session will explore the Master Data Management (MDM) default system for many companies, their BI stack and how we can use the ETL process to get a single version of truth for corporate data.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
