## Title: SQL Server Clustering 101
## Abstract:
### In this session we will cover the basics and delve into the advanced techniques which can be used to cluster Windows servers using the Windows Cluster Service, what sort of protection this provides you, and how to properly set up your clusters for a rock solid environment which will last you for many years to come.  We will start with planning our cluster configuration, selecting our software, and walk through the process of clustering two servers together into an active passive cluster.  We will cover the differences between a standalone machine and clusters with regard to licensing and multiple instance configurations.
