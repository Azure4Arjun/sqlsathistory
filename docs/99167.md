## Title: Make sense of real-time data using Elasticsearch
## Abstract:
### Elasticsearch is a data store built for addressing various data challenges using the foundations of speed, scale and relevance. It provides advanced querying, search and real-time analytics capabilities. Throughout this talk, we will introduce Elasticsearch and the Elastic Stack, demonstrate different use cases of using it as a main data store, or alongside with your current databases, using the polyglot persistence architectural approach. We'll have a look at a few real-time use cases, build some architectural castles in the sky and show a short introductory demo of how to get started with Apache Kafka and the Elastic Stack for your own real-time data applications.
