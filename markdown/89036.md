## Speaker: Buck Woody
## Title: Introduction to SQL Server Big Data Clusters
## Abstract:
### In this session Buck Woody explains how Microsoft has implemented the SQL Server 2019 relational database engine in a big data cluster leverages an elastically scalable storage layer that integrates SQL Server and HDFS to scale to petabytes of data storage. You’ll see the three ways you can interact with massive amounts of data: Data Virtualization, Data Marts, and working with a complete Kubernetes Cluster in SQL Server. 
You’ll also learn common use case scenarios that leverage big data and the SQL server 2019 Big Data Cluster on-premises, in the cloud, and in a hybrid architecture.

Learning Objectives:
- Articulate the Big Data Landscape and the problems it addresses
- Present the technology approaches to analyzing large, heterogenous data sets to an audience
- Design a solution using SQL Server 2019’s Big Data Clusters architecture and programming model
