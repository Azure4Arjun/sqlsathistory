## Title: Continuous Delivery for BI projects [EN]
## Abstract:
### If you are releasing new reports, SSAS cubes or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
Continuous Delivery is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the both the toolchain to support the practices as well as the mindset on the team. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

        The Path Ahead (direction)
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/User Story/Work Item (concept)
Team Services
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)
        Releases (tool)
