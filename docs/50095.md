## Speaker: Salvi Pascual
## Title: How SQL is helping to connect Cuba to the Web for free
## Abstract:
### Salvi works on a non-profit that connects thousands of Cubans to the web, via email. In Cuba, 25% of the population can access to email only, while 5% access to the Web without restrictions. After three years of work, his non-profit organization has collected several gigs of data that can re-shape our understanding about Cuba. 

Salvi will show data collected by this great technology, and how fascinating can be interpreting row information from a country that has been censored internally and externally for generations . The audience will have a unique opportunity to learn this technology, access this data and to use their skills to make a worldwide impact.
