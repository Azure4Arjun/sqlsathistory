## Speaker: Michael Wall
## Title: Azure Lift and Shift Best Practices
## Abstract:
### Going to the Cloud can be a very scary proposition for most companies, but a lot of your fears can be mitigated as long as you prepare for the experience.  Come learn with me and learn from my experiences as we cover the preparatory steps that can be taken to improve the initial experience.  After that, we will be listing out the general tasks that need to be setup in order to maintain an expected level of performance.  Next, we will be working on how to improve performance on an existing hybrid VM running SQL Server.  Finally, we will discuss some of settings and roles that you will want to have in the Azure Portal to allow you to monitor your well-performing Azure instance.  Bring your questions!  

Note, this session will exclusively deal with issues on a hybrid VM running SQL Server in Azure.  We may cover general issues that affect SQL Azure instances such as storage issues.
