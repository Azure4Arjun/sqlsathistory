## Title: How to Troubleshoot a Slow Running Query in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### You always wanted to troubleshoot a slow running query. But you just don’t know where to begin. In this demo-heavy session, I will show you how to troubleshoot a slow running query. You will see an end-to-end query tuning example with a slow running workload. We will capture important metrics while the workload is running and then use the captured data to troubleshoot query performance issues. The technique you will learn can be applied to production straight away. This will be a 100% demo session.
