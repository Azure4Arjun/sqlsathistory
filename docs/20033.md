## Speaker: Gareth Swanepoel
## Title: Building a SQL Server for Optimal Performance
## Abstract:
### Do SQL Server Administrators or Developers really know how to configure the hard- and software components of a SQL Server in order to have it running at peak performance ? This is not their fault and is purely due to the fact that they have not been exposed to these options before. If you are a DBA or developer and find yourself wondering how hardware changes affect a system or have questions relating to the performance implications of partitioning or compression, then this session is for you. In this session, I will be exploring topics such as Memory configuration, CPU and cache options, IO considerations, partitioning, compression and database file placement and many other performance optimisation tricks.
