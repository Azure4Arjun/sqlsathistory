## Title: Interrogating your data sources with Biml
## Abstract:
### You've decided to start using Biml to make your integration services packages. Congratulations! 

Now, you're looking at data sources other than SQL Server. How do you automate package development for these flat files, Excel Files, and other databases?  In this session, I'll share some of the techniques I've used to deal with these second-class sources. I'll be walking you through C# code.  Don't worry, I'm not a real programmer, so the code isn't the most complex, but it does solve the need.
