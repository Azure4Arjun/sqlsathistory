## Title: Extended Events â€“ The Top Features for efficient Traces [DE]
## Abstract:
### Extended Events, which entered the product in SQL Server 2008, are replacing the old SQL Trace  Profiler - and there are many good reasons for that. In this session you will see a selection of the most fascinating possibilities using this Tracing Framework. If you want to find out how to trace in a flexible and lightweight way, how to do advanced analysis directly inside the GUI, how to audit Database and Table-access without Auditing, how to analyze deadlocks without old-fashioned TraceFlags based on the built-in system_health session, this session is just for you. You will also learn how to use the GUI in an effective way for top-down-analysis and what is possible with some XQuery scripting.
