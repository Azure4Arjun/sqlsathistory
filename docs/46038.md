## Title: Performance Monitoring for Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### So you are responsible for monitoring the availability and performance of an SSAS instance  as well as making recommendations for performance improvements.   So you’re like no problem it’s just SQL Server right?  All of the “tricks of the trade” for SQL Server you have learned over the years will work right?  Then you do some research and find out that Analysis Services is not your mother’s SQL Server.  In this presentation we will open the “black box” that is Analysis services and highlight key areas of performance that you should be looking at when monitoring.  We will also discuss architecture of Analysis Services for both multidimensional and tabular model.
