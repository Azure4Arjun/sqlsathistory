## Title: Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics
## Abstract:
### Is your SQL Server instance running at its peak performance level?  Probably not but the real question is do you know why? Is your disk subsystem too slow or are you lacking enough CPU’s or is it something else entirely? It is very easy to capture and analyze the file  wait stat information that is automatically collected by the SQL Server instance so why not utilize them. We will see how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which area of SQL Server performance bottlenecks are doing you the most harm. This should be part of every DBA’s arsenal so come make it part of yours as well.
