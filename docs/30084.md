## Speaker: Erin Stellato
## Title: Who's responsible? The vendor or the DBA?
## Abstract:
### Database administrators - you don't really trust your third party software vendors, do you?  Software vendors - you think most of the DBAs out there are hiding things, don't you? Well guess what, you're both right!  Join Erin Stellato (representing vendors) and Mike Walsh (representing customers) for an interactive session where they will tackle some of the toughest challenges that DBAs and vendors face.  Attendees will walk out with a better understanding of what both parties can do to contribute to a successful relationship, as well as a set of fair questions to ask to set the right expectations from the start.
