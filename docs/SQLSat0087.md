## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: Everything You Need to Know About SQL Azure 
## Abstract:
### Cloud computing is one of the hot topic issues of the day and Microsoft is pushing hard to show that they are in the game to win. As such, SQL Azure is your data storage in the cloud solution. However, the platform is much different from simply a SQL Server that sits in the cloud and needs to be approached in an intelligent manner.  In this fast paced session, we will be going well beyond the simple “hello world” scenario to show you how to leverage the cloud architecture for data storage as well as educate you in how the cloud works differently than your local database instance. This session is going to be an eye opener for sure and will have many of you dreaming of your data sitting in the cloud.

## Speaker: Arie Jones
## Title: Master Data  Services in Denali 
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs at one time or another have been taught the importance of master data management(MDM), which is just comprised of a set of processes and tools in order to keep your non-transactional data in a consistent state. However, with today’s fast paced environment and tightening budgets most DBAs lack the resources to properly implement it. With the upcoming release of Denali, Microsoft has taken their second swipe at providing a tool known as Master Data Services(MDS) to aid the DBA in this endeavor. In this session, you will learn the basics of MDS in Denali  This session will definitely be an eye opener for some that ar

## Speaker: Allen White
## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
## Abstract:
### How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.
