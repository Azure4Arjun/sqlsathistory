## Title: Insight Into Your Indexes With DMVs
## Abstract:
### Use the right tool from your SQL toolbox to maintain those indexes, determine which indexes are being used (and more importantly which ones are NOT being used), and get recommendations on indexes to create all from Dynamic Management Views. Walk away with scripts you can use in your environment IMMEDIATELY.
