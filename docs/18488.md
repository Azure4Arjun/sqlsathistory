## Title: The Turbo-Booster in SQL 2012: Columnstore Indexes
## Abstract:
### Do you want to improve your DWH query performance by 100 times by just adding one additional index? Not possible? Wrong! SQL Server 2012 provides you the new Columnstore Index which changes the paradigm for DWH queries completely. In this session we will look at the details of the new Columnstore Index, when it makes sense, when not, and what are the current restrictions of it. We will look into Row Store vs. Column Store, how to change data in tables that have a Columnstore Index defined, we talk about Segment Elimination, Batch Mode Execution, about Query Memory Grants, and finally about how you can make sure that SQL Server will use your Columnstore Index as effective as possible.
