## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. Query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!
