## Title: SQL Server 2014  2016 Features for non-Enterprise Customers
## Abstract:
### Since before the release of SQL Server 2014, it seems that everyone has been talking about the enhancements to Availability Groups, writable Clustered Columnstore indexes, and In-Memory OLTP (“Hekaton”). But if you are not running Enterprise Edition, what's in it for you? In this session, you will learn about a variety of features that are available in the other editions of SQL Server 2014 as well as what's coming in SQL Server 2016. These features are designed to make your job easier and your database applications faster.
