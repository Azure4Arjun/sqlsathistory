## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Discuss Your Career (Panel)
## Abstract:
### As a database professional, you have plenty of choice in your career path. Should you stay at the same company for 20 years, or change every few years? Much depends on what matters most to you. Do you want higher income, regular work hours, training, vacation time, group insurance, job security, lots of travel, telecommuting, or the possibility to advance to management?  The panel will give their observations and experience over decades of experience. Discussion will include at least one person who has spent over 19 years with the same employer, one person who has changed careers very recently, and everyone in attendance who is willing to give an opinion.
