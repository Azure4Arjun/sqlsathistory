## Title: Change Detection in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Change detection is a critical component of any system that moves data from one structure to another. Most data movement mechanisms are designed to move a subset of the data – only that which is new or changed since the last load. For that to work properly, there must be a reliable system for detecting delta data touched since the most recent load. 

In this session, we will review the tools and design patterns available in SQL Server for performing change detection. From source detection methods including change tracking and change data capture, to in-flight comparisons using hashed values, and even brute-force methods as a last resort, we’ll cover the spectrum of change detection tools in SQL Server.
