## Title: Women in Technology
## Abstract:
### Most women working in technology keep a low profile, rarely standing out, rarely pushing the extra effort that typically denotes excellence.  Women are constantly juggling to find the balance between career and family â€“with added complexity when children are involved.   Come and learn about the three essential career considerations for Women in Technology.   Understanding and applying these considerations can help you get to the next level of excellence in your career and family life. Men who understand these considerations can better support the women members in their life.   I will share some of my own experiences, challenges, and lessons learned as I have learned how to balance career, family, and life in general.
