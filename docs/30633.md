## Title: Designing and Optimizing SSAS Hierarchies
## Abstract:
### In this session Jose will do an overview of the different types of hierarchies and how to design user hierarchies in SSAS by defining attribute relationships and key columns the right way. Attendees will learn how to implement natural  unnatural hierarchies, balanced and ragged hierarchies, and Parent-Child hierarchies. Jose will show how to optimize SSAS hierarchies by specifying attribute and dimension types, member uniqueness, and aggregations. Jose will also do quick intro on querying hierarchies with MDX.
