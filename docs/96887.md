## Speaker: Rich Benner
## Title: Choose Your Own Adventure - Performance Edition
## Abstract:
### Remember those "choose your own adventure" books from when we were younger? Yep, that's what we're doing in this session.

We're going to start with a poorly performing query and choose which route we're going to take to see if we can make it better.

You don't need any previous experience in performance tuning for this session, we'll briefly cover each topic as it's chosen.

Potential topics include;
- Indexes
- Query Design
- Settings that might affect performance
- Scalar Functions
- SARGability
- Temp Tables

We'll be voting on where we go at each step to see where our journey takes us.

In the session we'll cover each topic a little but I will also provide a more in-depth explanation of everything we go through after the session if you want to learn more.
