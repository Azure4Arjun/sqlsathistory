## Title: Using DAX in SSMS and C#
## Abstract:
### While the Tabular Model provides great self-service features with Excel and Power View many BI needs exceed these solutions.  Using the DAX language within SSMS provides more flexibility and power.  Incorporating these statements into a solution, such as in C#, can provide for better delivery of complicated BI requests that users cannot complete on their own.  This presentation will give you a start on creating DAX statements and using those statements within a programming language.
