## Title: Business Intelligence Solutions in Azure
## Abstract:
### When the number of services is more than 600 in Azure, many questions arise surrounding the different services that can be included in a Business Intelligence Architecture. This session will cover traditional as well as modern Business Intelligence solutions taking advantage of technologies such as Azure HDInsight, Azure Data Lakes or Azure Event Hubs. 

I will go over the characteristics of the main services that can be implemented in a Business Intelligence solution in the cloud. The demo will include 5 of these services.
