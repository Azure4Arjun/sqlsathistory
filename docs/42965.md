## Title: The SSIS Catalog - What is it and Why should I use it.
## Abstract:
### The SSIS Catalog was introduced in SQL Server 2012.  This session is going to explore what the catalog is and how it can improve the scheduling and tracking package executions.  One of the biggest advantages to the SSIS Catalog is that it allows a single package to be ran with multiple environments without having to make any changes to the package.  First, we will review some bonus material with SSIS project parameters.  Then review their use with the catalog's environments.  Next, the fun will begin with examining the catalog and using it to execute packages in different environments.  Finally,  we will take a look that the catalog's logging and database to monitor and review the packages executions.
