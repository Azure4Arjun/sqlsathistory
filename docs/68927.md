## Title: Xamarin Data Syncing
## Abstract:
### How can your users continue to use your mobile application while offline? A look into how and why to make a mobile app work where a data connection is not available and how to keep that data synchronized between the device, cloud and other devices. 

Offline sync allows users to interact with a mobile application, viewing, adding, or modifying data, even where there isn't a network connection. Changes are stored in a local database, and once the device is online, the changes can be synced with the web service.
