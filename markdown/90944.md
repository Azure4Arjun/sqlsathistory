## Title: Monitoring Mission-critical SQL Servers: How to utilize alerting to predict system bottlenecks
## Abstract:
### In this session, we will deep-dive into the ocean of SQL Server monitoring alerts in large-scale and mission critical systems, from basic alerting and baselines into alerts assisted by machine learning. SQL Servers have dozens of important performance counters that DBAâ€™s should follow on server, instance, and database level. It is practically impossible to monitor all of these performance counters over time without a proper alerting strategy, methodology, and implementation. How to maximize your uptime? How to avoid unplanned unavailability situations?

This session goes through 10 different pain points in SQL Server monitoring and covers the ideology and mechanisms on why, how and when to utilize alerts.
