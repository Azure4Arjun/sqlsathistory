## Title: Now you see it, but did you really?  Correcting visual fallacies...
## Abstract:
### Humans see images 60,000x better than text but are we always seeing what is being shown?  In this talk, we will look at ways a visual designer can intentionally or unintentionally confuse readers by using techniques that are common but not correct.  We will discuss topics such as color theory, chart selection and placement among others.  Come join us to learn what makes a visualization clear and learn how to convey your story.
