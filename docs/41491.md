## Title: Understanding the Azure Data Stack
## Abstract:
### Today’s data world is changing. Relational databases are no longer considered the only option for a data project. 
With Azure as its front line, Microsoft pushes many new technologies out to the wild, and it’s important to understand their capabilities, strengths and weaknesses.

Why? Because when designing a solution, it’s important to choose the right tool for the right job, and SQL Server is not always the best choice. It’s also important to understand the new technologies in order to be able to explain why SQL Server IS the right tool when it is.

Among others, we will talk about Azure SQL Database, Stream Analytics, DocumentDB, Search, HDInsight, Machine Learning, Data Lake, U-SQL, and more.

Join this session to know how the DBA's role might be affected, get an understanding of the new technologies, when to use which one, and how to converge them into a robust data solution.
