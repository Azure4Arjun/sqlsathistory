## Title: Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros
## Abstract:
### Finding any IT industry publication that does not frequently reference Hadoop and Big Data is nearly impossible. Even so, to many SQL Server professionals it remains a mystery. 'Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros' is designed to bridge the gap between knowledge of SQL Server and an understanding of Hadoop by comparing similarities in key functionality. Equally important is understanding how Hadoop is different and the use cases in which it compliments SQL Server. Of special note are the ways Microsoft is integrating Hadoop in its data strategy and related products. Perhaps 2016, Hadoop's 10th birthday year, is the time for SQL Server Pros to become familiar with this platform and how to prepare for it's introduction into our work as data professionals.
