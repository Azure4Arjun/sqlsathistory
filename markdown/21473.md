## Title: TOPGUN SQL SERVER: Unlocking the Fighter Pilot in Every DBA
## Abstract:
### UNLOCKING THE FIGHTER PILOT IN EVERY DBA – Let’s discuss how piloting tactical jets and flying SQL Servers requires similar psychology, skills and composure, especially during emergencies! DBA performance in production environments matters greatly, even on the easiest of days. But when things go wrong, that’s when you really earn your money and discover the depth of your knowledge and your poise in emergency response. We’ll focus on improving successful handling of critical situations. Content is based upon the collective knowledge gained by many people over many years in high performance aircraft. We’ll investigate examples of how to, and how not to, handle extremely difficult situations. We will look at bullet proof techniques for improving DBA crisis management. We’ll dig into teamwork/crew coordination during critical scenarios. Get ready for takeoff as you’ll see some captivating flight video and, if you have the courage to, participate in a live exercise.
