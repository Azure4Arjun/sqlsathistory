## Title: Introduction to Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### In this session you will learn how to plan for a Data Warehousing project.  Why you need one, what the key steps are to developing one and designing a plan to have a successful project will all be discussed.  You will learn conceptually how you can leverage the Microsoft BI Stack to design and implement a Data Warehouse.  This session will focus more on the concepts of development rather than demonstrating the development itself.
