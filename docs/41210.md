## Speaker: Tim Ford
## Title: Power BI Intro for DBAs Using  Indexing Strategy Analysis as a Data Source
## Abstract:
### Like Frankenstein's Monster (or our teenagers) things get released into the wild and behave differently than planned - database usage patterns are no different.  Join Tim as he reviews what to look for when tweaking your index strategy: poor clustering key decisions, underutilized indexes, covering indexes gone wrong, overlooked heaps and fill factor failures are just a few of the blunders to be identified.  

Pointing out what is sub-par is only part of the process though.  As a group we will discuss what the better options are based upon what we uncover.  In a combination of instructor-led training and group discussion formats we will use Dynamic Management Objects, System Catalog Views and even Ola Hallengren's SQL Server Maintenance Solution to identify improvement points and next steps.  

Tim then goes one step further and introduces you to how Power BI takes this collected metadata to the next level of performance analysis.
