## Title:  Pro Tips:  Performance Tuning SSIS
## Abstract:
### Synchronous and asynchronous components, memory buffers, data type choices. Tuning the data flow is all about choices. In this session we'll explore some of the choices that can give you the biggest performance boosts in your ssis data flow. Together we'll walk through creating a performance baseline, the differences between synchronous and asynchronous components and a few simple patterns we can implement to improve performance in our SSIS packages.
