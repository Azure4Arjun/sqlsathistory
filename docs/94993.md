## Title: Extend Azure DevOps with a Custom PowerShell-based Pipeline Task
## Abstract:
### There are times where the Azure DevOps pipeline tasks that are available in the marketplace are not meeting your needs and you wished that you knew how to create your own. After attending this session, you’ll be able to do just that. In this session you’ll learn how to create your own deployable pipeline task with logic written using PowerShell. We’ll craft a custom design time form with a our own service connection, develop a PowerShell script that interacts with an external service, deploy to the marketplace as a private link, and install into an Azure DevOps collection.
