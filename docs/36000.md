## Title: Telling Stories with Data
## Abstract:
### Data is all around us; it is in bits and pieces; it is in shapeless chunks. These data can tell us stories. Organizations have loads of these data lying around, but seldom make use of it. Modern data analytics methods however, give us a plethora of methods to access this data, mash them up and tell stories using them. Stories, that can help make effective decisions.

This session looks at how you could collect data from the various sources in your organization, combine them, process them and tell stories using the wealth of tools given to us by Microsoft. Words you would hear are business intelligence, self-service data analytics and big data.
