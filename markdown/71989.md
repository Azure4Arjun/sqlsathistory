## Title: Should You Use M or R for Data Wrangling in Power BI? It Depends.
## Abstract:
### Since the inception of Power BI, Power Query and the M programming language have been the main option that Power BI developers had to get data into the Power BI data model. In 2016 Microsoft gave us another option. They added the the ability to use the R programming language as a data source. 

R is a very popular statistical programming language that has some powerful “data wrangling” capabilities. In this session Patrick Leblanc and Ryan Wade will explore several data wrangling task in Power BI using both M and R. We will compare the two and show when it is best to use one over the other.
