## Title: SSRS In the Enterprise - Surviving With a Smile!
## Abstract:
### If you plan to use SSRS in a large enterprise there are many things you should do be successful - things that do not seem to have much prescriptive guidance for. The purpose of this session is to provide you with guidance around those administrative things you should do to have a successful, maintainable SSRS Site in a large Enterprise. We wll discuss
 
How should folder structure and security be set up?
Are there best practices around data sources? 
Are SSRS 2008 Report Models Models ready for the enterprise? 
How should projects be organized?  
Is Report Builder 2.0 good enough yet? 
What works well and what will cause you pain? 
 
We will spend our time in a very practical discussion to help you get SSRS deployed and working.
