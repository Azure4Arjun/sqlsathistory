## Speaker: Stacia Varga
## Title: (Way Too Much) Fun with Reporting Services 
## Abstract:
### Head starting to explode from all the technical information you’re absorbing?  Come spend a session with us while we play games with Reporting Services…literally!  Come watch and cheer as SQL Server MVP Stacia Misner is challenged by her progeny and protégé Erika Bakse to an hour of word play, all wrapped up in SQL Server Reporting Services.  They’ll push the limits with what can be built in SSRS and have a stupid amount of fun while doing it.  Swag, trash talk, board games and SQL…who could ask for more?
