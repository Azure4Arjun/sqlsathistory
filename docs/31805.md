## Title: Publishing Access Applications to SharePoint
## Abstract:
### This sessions is designed for user with experience developing Access applications.  It will focus on Access 2010 with SharePoint 2010 to explore the different degrees of publishing Access and how it solve issues many IT departments have with Access including: Access databases are never backed up.  Every copy of the XYZ Access database has different data in it.  Publishing form and report updates to dozens or hundreds of users is a nightmare.  We will then dive deep into how IT departments can publish an Access application to Access Services on SharePoint with Web forms, reports, queries, and macros that eliminate the need for Access on the client machine entirely.
