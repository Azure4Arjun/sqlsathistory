## Title: A journey through the Modern Data Warehouse
## Abstract:

Which is the best architecture in order to get over these new challenges? 
Join this session and learn how to enable the Modern Data Warehouse in your organization using Cubes, HDInsight, AzureML, Stream Analytics and DocumentDB. All through a continuous example using a retail shop scenario.
