## Title: Hacking SQL / SQL Injection
## Abstract:
### Recently there has been an increase in reported SQL Injection attacks using web applications. We will discuss and demonstrate how hackers will attack a database using a web application. The methods demonstrated are freely available on the internet, and require very little skill. We will also discuss 'hardening' the database in order to protect against most attacks. The discussion will include: How to 'Think like a hacker'; The What/How of SQL Injection; Protecting against SQL injection; How to use SQL Server security to limit risk; Protecting your data; Monitoring database activities with minimal performance impact.
