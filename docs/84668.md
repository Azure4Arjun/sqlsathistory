## Title: Shard Attack - Horizontal Scaling in Azure SQL Database
## Abstract:
### Traditionally, when a server starts to reach its limit we have simply thrown more resources at it, either more CPU, memory or disk. 
However there comes a point, especially in the cloud, where it is no longer possible to add more resources to a single database.  Here we need a different solution.
Instead of scaling up we must scale out, sometimes called horizontal scaling or sharding.
 
In this talk we will look at how to scale out in Microsoft Azure SQL database using the Azure Elastic Database tools
We will look at the requirements and options for horizontal scaling in Azure and then we will have a go at sharding an Azure SQL database and then querying and updating the different shards
We will be using t-sql, PowerShell and c# so come prepared for some serious coding
