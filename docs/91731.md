## Title: 4 Threats to your SQL Servers - Become Default: Secure
## Abstract:
### In our connected world, the threat landscape is rapidly increasing. Phishing is leading to severe and crippling ransomware attacks. Malicious outsiders (and insiders) have cost much downtime. Not to mention the "traditional" threats such as "oops deletes" or site crashes. How do we protect against all of this? Is this even the DBA's role?

In this session, we'll explore 4 types of active threats to your data and organization. We'll talk about the various solutions available and help you see which threats you are vulnerable to if you've not gone far enough as we match threats and answers. Sadly, we'll share real stories of folks who've lost it all from these threats.

It's more than "take your backups, verify them, and periodically test them!" Ransomware and malicious outsiders (or insiders) eat your online backups for breakfast. 

Leave prepared, not scared, as you adopt a "Default: Secure" posture and lead the charge, even if we are "only" DBAs.
