## Title: Index 360 - Looking at Indexes from Multiple Perspectives
## Abstract:
### If you have used a database, chances are almost certain you've utilized indexes as well.  In this presentation I will discuss both Rowstore and Columnstore Indexes and why they are important to anyone that interacts with a database.  This session will cover what they are, how they are utilized, how best to take advantage of them, and even when they can be problematic. It is my intention to help anyone become more comfortable with indexes and understand what they can do for you and your role, be it a DBA, Developer, or BI Professional.
