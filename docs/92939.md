## Title: Building Your First SQL Server Container Lab in Docker
## Abstract:
### A few years back virtualization changed the way to work with SQL and infrastructure. Now the next chapter is opening and it’s all about containers. Containers can make the DBA’s job of creating and deploying servers much easier freeing them up for other tasks such as performance tuning and security. 

In this session, we will go over the concepts of containers, their general capabilities, and then build, connect and configure a SQL Server in a container for use as a private lab.
