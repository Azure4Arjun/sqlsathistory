## Title: "Full Text indexing!" or..."What is that service I never turn on?"
## Abstract:
### If you've ever wondered what that other service is in your configuration manager then this is the class for you.  Full text indexing allows you to write queries to scan large text fields without having to do a complete table scan every time.

We'll talk about installing, setting up, maintaining, and using full text indexes to their fullest!
