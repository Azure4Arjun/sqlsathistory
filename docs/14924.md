## Title: Monitoring and collecting storage info for DBAs
## Abstract:
### As an admin, we need to keep an eye on storage: What is the total size and available size on disk devices? What about mount points? How much space does each database take? What about breaking that down into schemas, tables, data size, and index size? Granted, some of that can be seen through Management Studio reports, but what if we want to keep a historical record of all that for planning and trending purposes? What if we are on a tight budget and cannot afford monitoring software.

In this session, I will explain and demo a PowerShell/SQL Server combo solution that is simple, elegant, and works! You will come away with code and instructions on how to implement it.
