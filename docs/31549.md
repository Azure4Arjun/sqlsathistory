## Title: Debug TalkAbout
## Abstract:
### The Debug TalkAbout will review a wide range of tools and techniques used to debug .NET code developed using Visual Studio and other code that may be misbehaving.  Most of the tools discussed are either available on your system or as no cost downloads from the Web. Since there is more material in this talk than will fit into the schedule, this talk will be audiance directed.
