## Title: Master of All I Survey - track code changes and more across your environment
## Abstract:
### Almost everyone's seen it happen - problems due changes made on servers, be it SPs, index rebuilds, or even configuration changes. But what if you could look historically across servers and track down what changes were made when, by who, and from where? It exists, it's already built into SQL Server standard edition from 2005-2014, and it's easy to implement. Come learn what Event Notification is and why you'll want it in your environment. We'll start at the basics and end by checking new production code changes into TFS.
