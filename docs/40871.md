## Title: What's New in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 is on the way!   SQL Server 2016 represents the largest release of SQL Server in almost 20 years.  This will be the largest release in SQL Server since SQL 2000.  Why?  After SQL 2000 Microsoft took an approach to have major releases to the Database engine or the Business Intelligence Platform.  That was the pattern for SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2014.  In this release we will get change to SSRS, SSAS, SSIS, In-Memory OLTP, and AlwaysOn Availability Groups.  We get new features like R integration, JSON Support, Polybase (the ability to query big data sources with T-SQL), Data Zen Integration, HTML 5 support, and much much more.  If you use SQL Server, this release will impact you.  Come find out how!
