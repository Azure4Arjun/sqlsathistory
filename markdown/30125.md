## Title: SSIS - A Beginning Framework
## Abstract:
### Most developers would agree that every SSIS solution will have the same fundamental outline. A basic framework will expedite the process by handling the common tasks between the systems while allowing the developer to concentrate on the task at hand. This framework will consist of many items, including but not limited to setting up package configurations, logging, audit trails, error handling, naming standards, etc. This session will present an example framework which can be used as the basis for future SSIS Package.  

In response to previous comments, the majority of the material will be presented via demos.
