## Speaker: Rick Heiges
## Title: Cloudy with a Chance of Data
## Abstract:
### The 'Cloud" is here.  With it, there are many options for storing and processing data.  What does it mean?  Why should you be interested in this conversation?  How can a cloud solution compare to an "on-prem" solution?  We will discuss these questions and more. The focus of this session will be on the options available in Azure from Azure SQL DB to Azure SQL Data Lake, but we will also touch on AWS and Google Cloud options to put the options in context.
