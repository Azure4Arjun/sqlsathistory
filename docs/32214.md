## Title: Problem Solving with Common Table Expressions
## Abstract:
### Are you looking for an easier way to de-duplicate your data? Do you need to join a SELECT statement to itself six ways to Sunday? Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can make these tasks (and many others) so much more manageable, you'll wonder how you ever got along without them. CTEs are a very useful method for abstracting data access in most of the popular relational database platforms (MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2). This session will walk through syntax and implementation of CTEs in MS SQL Server. We will then focus on their practical uses, including self-joins, taking advantage of windowing functions, removing duplicates from data sets, and recursion.
