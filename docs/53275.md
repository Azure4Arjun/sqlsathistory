## Title: What You're Missing If You Aren't Using SQL Windowing Functions
## Abstract:
### Weâ€™ll explain and demo techniques you are missing out on that you can use to solve difficult sql problems using sql windowing functions including: - Determining how many stops a sport-band user made during a day and how long their average stop was, adjusting for altitude and position using both windowing functions and sql spatial functions. - Merging separate fiscal calendars with differing periods and different granularities (month vs. day, etc.) - Finding equivalent fiscal days or calendar days in previous or future years - Calculating percentiles on data to be used for Analytic tools and more!
