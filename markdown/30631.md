### Need to know what is the corresponding SSIS transformation or task to a specific T-SQL statement? How do you accomplish Unions, Joins, and Merges in SSIS? How do you do CASE statements in SSIS? How do you group and aggregate data in SSIS? In this session I will cover the some of the most important SSIS control flow and data flow tasks to jump start DBAs and Developers into SSIS with SQL Server 2008-R2. At the end of this demo, you will be able to identify what control flow tasks and data flow transformations can be used in place of T-SQL statements and scripts. I will also cover how to accomplish in SISS: Basic SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE statements, Inner and Outer joins, Union, Aggregates, Merge, CAST, CASE, Sorting, Grouping, etc
