## Title: Recovery that May or May Not have a Wizard
## Abstract:
### The wizards that come with SQL Server help us accomplish many things including recovering the database; however, we can not use the wizards for all our data recovery issues.  In this session we'll review recovery topics of page corruption, temporary storage loss, master database recovery, and other data recovery scenarios.  We'll also determine which of these scenarios can be resolved with a wizard.
