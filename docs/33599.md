## Title: Building an ETL Framework with SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Integration Services is an excellent tool for quickly building ETL packages - so much so that many database professionals find themselves managing dozens, or even hundreds, of individual SSIS packages. In this session we will explore a practical approach to building an ETL framework to make the task of managing a large number of packages easier. We'll demonstrate how to use expressions and configurations for object reuse, along with ways to share values and objects among multiple packages.
