## Title: What's an execution plan and why does it matter?
## Abstract:
### Even if you've never looked at an execution plan before, you'll come away from this talk with a good understand of why they're a critical tool in performance tuning. We'll cover how to get the plan and how to read it. We'll look at some badly performing queries and see what the execution plan tells us about how we can improve their performance.
