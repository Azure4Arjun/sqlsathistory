## Title: Implementing Data Warehouse Patterns with the Microsoft BI Tools
## Abstract:
### You’ve read some of the content of well-known Data Warehousing books – now what? How do you take the structures and disciplines inside such books as the Ralph Kimball series and implement them? This session will take several of the key concepts in Data Warehousing and demonstrate some implementations using SQL Server Integration Services and Analysis Services. We’ll look at items such as Type 2 Changing Dimensions, Confirmed Dimensions, Dimension Outriggers, Role-Playing Relationships, Many-to-Many Bridge table relationships, Factless Fact tables, Handling of NULL foreign key values, and more.
