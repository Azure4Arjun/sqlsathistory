## Title: SSRS for .Net Developers 
## Abstract:
### At fist glance, SSRS can seem like an odd fit for .Net reporting. There is a little known side of SSRS that allows it to integrate seamlessly into an application's architecture. This session will introduce the concept of local mode reporting and how this feature allows direct binding to your Data Layer, Entity Model or any other type of object collection in your application.
