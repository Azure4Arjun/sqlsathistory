## Title: Get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition
## Abstract:
### How can you get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition? The SQL Server Enterprise Edition (EE) is far more expensive than the Standard Edition (SE). Many small office applications use SE. What features do you really need for your database system? Many features that are only available in EE, such as partitioning and data compression, are specific to managing larger databases. If you do not have very large databases, perhaps SE will be sufficient. Find out what actually improves performance for SE.
