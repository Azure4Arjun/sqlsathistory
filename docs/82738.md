## Speaker: Allan Pead
## Title: Getting Started with Azure IoT Edge
## Abstract:
### The Intelligent Edge: Make hybrid cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions a reality with Azure IoT Edge, a fully managed service that delivers cloud intelligence locally. Seamlessly deploy and run artificial intelligence, Azure services, and custom logic directly on cross-platform IoT devicesâ€”from a small Raspberry Pi to large industrial machines. And manage it all centrally in the cloud with the security of Microsoft.

Use the same programming models you use in the cloud to create and test your IoT applications and then push them to your edge devices.  This session is an introduction to Azure Iot Edge and what it can do for you.
