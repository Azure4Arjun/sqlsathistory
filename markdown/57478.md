## Title: Handling Relationships in DAX
## Abstract:
### The Tabular model in Power Pivot for Excel, Power BI and SSAS Tabular seems to offer only plain-vanilla one-to-many relationships, based on a single column. In 2015 there was the introduction of many-to-many relationships, yet the model seems somewhat poor when compared with SSAS Multidimensional. In reality, by leveraging the DAX language, you can handle virtually any kind of relationship, no matter how complex they are. In this session we will analyze and solve several scenarios with calculated relationships, virtual relationships, complex many-to-many. The goal of the session is to show how to solve complex scenarios with the aid of the DAX language to build unconventional data models.
