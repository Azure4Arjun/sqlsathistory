## Title: Improve data load speed and query performance with Columnstore indexes
## Abstract:
### Is data load performance into columnstore slowing you down? Should you drop nonclustered indexes before loading data? What batchsize should you choose? How should you handle large number of Updates/Deletes? Columnstore index can speed up the performance of analytics queries significantly but are you getting the best performance possible? Come to this session to learn the best practices and the techniques customers have used to load data in parallel with minimal or reduced logging into columnstore index. Specifically, we will cover data load using BCP, Bulk Insert, SSIS or MERGE command, concurrent trickle insert in IOT scenario as well as moving data from staging table. We will also talk about how to diagnose performance issues in queries accessing columnstore index and the steps you can take to troubleshoot.
