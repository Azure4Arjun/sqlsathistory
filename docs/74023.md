## Title: The extraordinary effect of Python support in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Python is one of the most popular languages this days and we are very excited to have an ability to use Python inside SQL Server stored procedures starting SQL Server 2017.
If you are Database Administrator - you need to get to know this wonderful feature! Learn how it can solve DBA's everyday challenges when dealing with text and json files, bulk loads and even simplify ETL flows when you need to get data from database systems other than SQL Server. Moreover, you can offload the big data querying to nosql database and use Python to get the results into SQL server. Have you ever dreamed about receiving emails from SQL Server stored procedure? Yes, Python can do that!
This session will answer questions like:

-	Why do I need to learn Python if I am not working with Machine learning?

-	How are the external scripts isolated?
-	What is the new Launchpad service?
