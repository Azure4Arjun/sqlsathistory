## Title: A time travel with temporal tables
## Abstract:
### Temporal Tables also known as System Versioned Tables is a new feature in SQL Server 2016 which allows to see the data (in one or more tables) exactly as they were in a point of time ago. 

In this session will be shown how to implement them in new and existing tables, the most common scenarios where they are useful for major productivity benefits, like data audit, disaster recovery, trending analytics and others, all of these will be covered in demo time.
