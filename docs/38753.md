## Title: Continuous Integration with Sql Server Data Tool and Team Foundation Server
## Abstract:
### Keep your DBAs happy. Sounds like an impossible task ? In this session we are going to walkthrough different scenarios based on the interaction between SSDT and Team Foundation Server. Developing locally and publishing the changes to an on-premises instance of SQL Server. We will walkthrough several scenarios to get an idea of what works when and what doesnâ€™t. At the end of this session you will be able to know how to get the best out of TFS and where the limitations are. You will also be able to pinpoint several other solutions for doing Continuous Integration with SSDT without compromising the flexibility.
