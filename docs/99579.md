## Title: Querying NoSQL with SQL: HAVING Your JSON Cake and SELECTing it too
## Abstract:
### Until recently, agile business had to choose between the benefits of JSON-based NoSQL databases and the benefits of SQL-based querying. NoSQL provides schema flexibility, high performance, and elastic scaling, while SQL provides expressive, independent data access. Recent convergence allows developers and organizations to have the best of both worlds.

Developers need to deliver apps that readily evolve, perform, and scale, all to match changing business needs. Organizations need rapid access to their operational data, using standard analytical tools, for insight into their business. In this session, you will learn the ways that SQL can be applied to NoSQL databases, and what additional features are needed to deal with JSON documents. SQL for JSON, JSON data modeling, indexing, and tool integration will be covered. This session will focus mainly on CosmosDb and Couchbase, but it will also touch on emerging relational approaches to JSON data.
