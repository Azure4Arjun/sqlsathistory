## Speaker: Terry McCann
## Title: Using AI to write session submission to SQLSaturday
## Abstract:
### Deep learning has been used to write new Shakespearean sonnets, to imagine new delicious recipes, write hilarious Harry Potter novels and even come up with new names for beer! In this session we will understand, what is deep learning, what are neural nets, what are the steps required to build a deep learning model and look at some of the great examples mentioned. 

We will then turn our new skills to the problem most speakers have! Writing session abstracts. Together we will develop a recursive neural net designed to generate new SQLSaturday session abstracts, entirely based on previously submitted sessions to SQLSaturday. Will we be able to produce a session you would have attended? Come along and fine out.
