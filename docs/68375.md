## Abstract:
### With the emergence of SQL Server 2017 vNext on Linux, new challenges arise for High Availability and Disaster Recovery solutions. What kind of features and add-on's exists in Linux that provide this type of solutions and the interoperability between instances in hybrid scenarios (with Linux and Windows) ? How can we configure all the scenarios we know of Windows on Linux and additionally how we can implement such hybrid scenarios ? Join me in this session where we will discuss all these points, as well as possible architectures and best practices in implementing HA \ DR scenarios in SQL Server 2017 vNext on Linux.
