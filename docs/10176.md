## Title: Continuous Integration and Delivery
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration and deployment are two practices that can drastically reduce any software company's testing and deployment time. In this talk, we will be discussing several tools that you can use to streamline these tasks, as well as how you can go from zero to a baseline project on a development environment in less that 5 minutes. The days of copying and pasting files to deploy your code are over.
