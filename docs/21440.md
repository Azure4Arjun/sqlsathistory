## Title: Decisions, Decisions...
## Abstract:
### Decision-trees are the bread-and-butter of predictive modeling. Conceptually simple, fast to build and easy to interpret - yet quite powerful and versatile. They come in many flavors, from the smallest tree to vast (random) forests
This session will explain the basics of decision trees and demonstrate the process of building, interpreting, tuning, pruning and validating a simple model using the Data Mining components of SQL Server Analysis Services.
