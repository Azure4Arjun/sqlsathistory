## Title: Recover from a Disaster–What to do When All Fails
## Abstract:
### Backups, check.  Off-site storage, check.  Ability to actually restore a database…  Believe it or not, the vast majority of organizations still don’t have the ability to recover from a real disaster.  Based on over 20 years of dealing with real disasters – natural and man-made, you’ll walk through how to deal with a variety of situations while ensuring you are covered.  We’ll go from backups, through disaster evaluation, and end up with how to perform a last resort recovery; the kind required when your backups aren’t valid and your off-site storage was also compromised.
