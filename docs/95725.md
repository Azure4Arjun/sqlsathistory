# SQLSaturday #903 - Johannesburg 2019
Event Date: 07-09-2019 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker: Andrew Collier
## Title: Web Scraping
## Abstract:
### There's a wealth of data available on the internet which can be used for data augmentation or to create entirely new datasets. The data might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across multiple (possibly hundreds or thousands) pages. Web scraping allows you to gather those data and consolidate them in a convenient format. This will be a hands-on tutorial in R, so bring your machine and follow along.
