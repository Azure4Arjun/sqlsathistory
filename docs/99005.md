## Title: Azure Data Factory Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### This immersive full day hands on session will arm you with all the skills you need to build and orchestrate pipelines using Azure Data Factory v2 that solve both traditional data integration problems and also adapt to newer challenges such as real-time and complex event processing.
We will start with a conceptual overview, and then explore using metadata to build scalable serverless pipelines to move data from disparate data sources including On-Premises and Platform As A Service. We will look at how to leverage SSIS Lift and shift to maximize reuse for your existing code base and review the pros and cons of this approach. We will dive deep and cover the design patterns and architectures for modern data warehouses and big data pipelines. We will also review best practices for operationalizing solutions including configuring monitoring, logging and alerting and implementing DevOps and CI/CD. This day is everything you need to do amazing things with Azure Data Factory.
