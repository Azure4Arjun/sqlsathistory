## Speaker: William Wolf
## Title: Service Broker - Put Me In Coach
## Abstract:
### This session is an introduction to Service Broker basics and how you can use it to for an alternative to ETL, batch processing and other asynchronous operations. Service Broker allows you to process your data asynchronously in a single instance. It makes for  a near real time ETL process. 

We will start off with the basic components of Service Broker. Then use what we have learned to  configure it to process some real life data using American Football Plays on a single database deployment. In addition, we will then use Service Broker as a replication alternative to show the ETL capabilities using databases on two separate instances.

At the end of this session, you will have the knowledge to use Service Broker for batch processing, ETL or even an alternative to replication.

# Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#550-San-Antonio-2016)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Ted Stathakis
## Title: Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting  Services is finally getting some love!  In this session you will get a brief peek at some of the new features and functionality including a look at the new Report Manager interface and the new control we have over the parameter placement on screen.

We will then dive into how to use a custom report, based on the ReportServer database transaction log table, to see which reports are actually being used and use that report to determine a smart strategy for which reports to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  You will see how to combine this understanding of active reports with the power of linked reports to simplify your Reporting Services implementation as you convert to SQL Server 2016.

The session will conclude with a look at my “Ultimate Footer”, which you can use on any version of Reporting Services, that shows report utilization, performance details, stored procedures and data sets used and discover any inline TSQL being abused.

# Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#550-San-Antonio-2016)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kalen Delaney
## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
## Abstract:
### SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Title: Log SQL Server Activity on a Budget
## Abstract:
### SQL Server has some of the best monitoring tools out there. But what about that server you just discovered? And you're all out of monitoring licences? Or, what if you need additional information that your monitoring tool isn't providing? Or, would you like execution plans and lock information for further analysis? All this and more is possible using the industry standard sp_whoisactive, created by Adam Machanic, to monitor and log activity on your SQL Servers. This session will teach you how to log and query the wealth of information sp_whoisactive provides.

# Why Should I Care About … The Plan Cache
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#550-San-Antonio-2016)
Event Date: 13-08-2016 - Session time: 15:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why Should I Care About … The Plan Cache
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first installment of Rick’s “Why should I care” series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV’s for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMVs are worth slogging through.

## Title: Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB
## Abstract:
### The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS.  


This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL Database without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. 


Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS using Power BI as a test application.

## Speaker: Konstantin Melamud
## Title: Scaling for best performance: Partitioned views.
## Abstract:
### Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition.  Even though that is correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. 

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to imitate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining both partitioned views and table partitioning as well as inMemory tables to give us an ability to use double partition elimination based on two different keys as well as the ability to move hot spots data into inMemory OLTP.

## Title: Introduction to Biml
## Abstract:
### Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.

## Speaker: Jennifer McCown
## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
## Abstract:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

## Speaker: Lori Edwards
## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
## Abstract:
### For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Speaker: Ryan Casey
## Title: Create a Data Loading Strategy
## Abstract:
### Loading large amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. Many factors may challenge your goal for tuned performance. To make the decision making process more difficult, many of the choices listed below have both Pros and Cons to their implementation. For this reason, bulk loading large amounts of data requires a strategy.

Create a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes.
•	High Performance Data Loading
•	Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading
•	Indexing Considerations
•	Delayed Durability
•	Eager Write

This session uses a Virtual Sandbox to demonstrate “real” data loads using these techniques listed above. We will look at the T-SQL used in these data loads. We will briefly discuss how the different settings and configurations effect the data loads. Power Point slides and sample SQL will be provided.

## Speaker: Keith Tate
## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
## Abstract:
### Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works, but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool.
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool!
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events. 
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!
