## Title: Recovering Data from Fatally Corrupt Databases
## Abstract:
### Imagine the worst case scenario: Your database won't come online. Lots of checksum errors logged. DBCC CheckDB won't even run on the database. And worst of all - you have no backups! Now what do you do with this 20GB binary blob of an MDF file?

In this demo-rich session I will briefly introduce the internals of MDF files while primarly concentrating on how to manually extract data from corrupt databases. I will be using the OrcaMDF RawDatabase framework to do most of the parsing, which will also be explained during the session.
