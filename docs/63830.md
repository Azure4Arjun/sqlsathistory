## Speaker: Matt Martin
## Title: Optimization, Optimization – Make Your Queries Faster
## Abstract:
### In this class, we will take some real world examples of very complex queries that have over a dozen joins (inner, left, and cross) and break them down to their foundational parts, restructure and rebuild, and improve performance dramatically. We will touch on techniques such as leveraging temp tables, creating indexes, and looking at execution plans to know when you’ve gone far enough on the optimization. Time is money right?...time to save a ton!
