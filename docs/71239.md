## Title: Insight into the SQL Server Buffer Cache
## Abstract:
### When we talk about memory usage in SQL Server, we are often referring to the buffer cache.  This is an important part of SQL Serverâ€™s architecture, and is responsible for the ability to query frequently accessed data quickly.  Knowing how the buffer cache works will allow us to properly allocate memory in SQL Server, gauge accurately how databases are accessing data, and ensure that there are not inefficiencies in our code that cause excessive data to be cached.
