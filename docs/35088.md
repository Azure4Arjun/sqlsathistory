## Title: Using Wait-Time Analysis for Database Performance
## Abstract:
### "Using Wait-Time Analysis for Database Performance Monitoring and
Tuning"

There are many ways to use wait events for performance tuning, but often
there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The wait event data
may be analyzed at the wrong level or not detailed enough. Confio will
focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies using
wait event data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to
solve the most difficult performance related issues.
