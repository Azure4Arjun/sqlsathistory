## Title: Working With XML in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the XML data type, do basic operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!
Session Goals:
•	Learn how to use FOR XML PATH and WITH NAMESPACE clauses
•	Understand the basic use of the XML data type and XML schema collections
•	Learn how to use XML DML to manipulate XML data
