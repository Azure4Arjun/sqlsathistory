## Title: One Developers Journey into MDX
## Abstract:
### "You are a database guy, how do I write a query in MDX?" This is a question that many of you are probably hearing right now as your companies' database experts. As the amount of data access being delivered cubes in increasing every day your company is looking to you to help unlock that stored potential. You have used the query designers and profiler to build some really simple stuff, but now you need to really understand the language and figure how to do some more complex stuff. This session will help you take that journey from not understanding MDX to being an MDX Developer. This session will give you the core concepts of MDX and how to utilize them with clear concrete examples, along with the tools to get you there.
