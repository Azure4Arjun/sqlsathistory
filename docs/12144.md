## Title: Business Analytics with Microsoft Power BI 101
## Abstract:
### The world of data is changing. Mobile, social, and cloud trends are vastly increasing the quantity and types of data available for businesses to leverage in their decision making and strategic planning. Many leading companies are already taking advantage of these newer data trends to improve operational awareness, increase customer reach, and attain better market visibility. Some of the newer features (Power BI) of familiar products such as SQL Server, SharePoint, and Microsoft Office allow businesses to more easily achieve these goals by using technologies they already own.  

This session will provide a high-level overview of Business Intelligence and Big Data, discuss industry trends and use cases, and provide a live demonstration of a Business Analytics scenario using Microsoft Power BI and other tools.
