## Title: Handling JSONs in SQL Server 2016
## Abstract:
### Consuming data from JSON is now much easier with the new built-in support introduced in SQL Server 2016!
During this session will talk about JSON representation and will explore the new functions used for handling the content from a JSON file. Based on some examples we'll transform a JSON text to relational table and then will export some data from SQL Server as JSON.
