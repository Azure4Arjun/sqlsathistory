## Title: Testing with SSIS
## Abstract:
### Often times, a database developer needs to test the data under different scenarios.  There are many ways to do that, and some of them involve using TFS and other expensive tools. However, the often-overlooked way to create unit tests and even to automate the data lifecycle is always under the DB developer's finger tips and involves using SSIS and jobs agent for the test automation. The session will provide live hands on examples.
