## Title: Configuring SQL Server for Mission Critical and Scalable Deployments
## Abstract:
### SQL Server offers various configuration settings and tuning parameters. As hardware capabilities increase rapidly, choosing the proper configuration settings is extremely important to scale SQL Server for the required application throughput rates. In the last two  years, SQL Server Escalation Team has helped many systems administrators and database administrators scale their SQL Server with several configuration parameters and application patterns. In this session you will hear directly from an experienced member of the Microsoft SQL Server escalation team [Suresh Kandoth], about these specific learnings, configurations and approaches for scaling SQL Server on the largest hardware systems available on the planet.
The goal of this session to help you and guide you to perform successful deployment of SQL Server for your largest SQL Server installations.
