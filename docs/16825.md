## Speaker: Jim Horn
## Title: T-SQL: How to create a million sample people
## Abstract:
### This session is a demo how you can create T-SQL code to create a table with a million rows of sample people with addresses, phone number, date of birth, and other demographic columns.  Useful for creating realistic-looking data for a project that doesn't have any, or de-identifying existing data for development and testing purposes.
