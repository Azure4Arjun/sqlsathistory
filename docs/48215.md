## Title: T-SQL Window Functions for Analytics
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2016 includes advanced T-SQL window functions.  These functions allow for high performance native T-SQL, combining three categories of functions with the OVER clause:

* Analytic Functions
* Ranking Functions
* Aggregate Functions

Advanced Excel analysts might be creating similar output with Excel:  though intermediate to heavy equation usage is better with SQL Server (Developer Edition recommended).  These functions are recommended for feature creation in data science.  This presentation will cover the basics of the three T-SQL categories and provide use cases and demos, especially for advanced analytics and machine learning.
