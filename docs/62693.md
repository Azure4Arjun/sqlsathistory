## Title: Execution Planning for Success
## Abstract:
### Execution plans are one of the best ways to learn how SQL Server is interpreting your query. We'll discuss execution plan internals, how SQL Server estimates the cost of your query, and what a graphical execution plan is displaying. 

Learning to read an execution plan is a great way to begin troubleshooting performance. At the end, we will take a look at how SQL Server 2016 provides more tools for exploring execution plans.
