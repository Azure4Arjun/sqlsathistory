## Title: BI is a Journey, Not a Destination
## Abstract:
### With analytics becoming a buzzword in the recent past, everyone seems to want it in their businesses. Known as business intelligence for a long time, it helps an organization’s various decision makers take better business decisions using the insights that is provided. However, the path to a successful business intelligence implementation was always hounded by failure – The main reason being that BI is conceived as a one-time-implemented packaged solution, whereas business intelligence is in reality a journey.
This session will focus on how you could develop a business intelligence solution by taking the organization on an evolving journey, using the various Microsoft tools and technologies at different stages.
