## Title: Laying down the Law with SQL Server Resource Governor
## Abstract:
### Busy SQL Servers may host multiple concurrent workloads, including interactive end users, batch workloads and administrator activity.
This session will detail use of the Resource Governor to distinguish resource utilization among the different workloads.  We'll explore the resource limits and controls available in Resource Pool and Workload Group configuration, and how they relate to resource limits at other levels.
We'll also cover potential performance and scaling effects of Resource Governor, and how to monitor and evaluate behavior under a given set of configurations. Real-world examples will detail how greater query concurrency and better performance was achieved for the most important work on systems.
