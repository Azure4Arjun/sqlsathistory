## Speaker: Glen Gordon
## Title: Agile isn't the A in DBA, but you still should know it
## Abstract:
### Backlogs! Standups! Burndowns! If you ever find yourself - as a data professional - immersed in an organization that follows an agile methodology, you're going to want to have a basic understanding of typical roles, artifacts, events, and nomenclature associated with that methodology. In this session, you'll get a quick overview of agile methodologies (focusing on Scrum) and how they apply to the way data professionals work as part of a software development team. You'll leave with an understanding of the goals that agile methodologies try to achieve, resources to learn more, and confidence in knowing a PBI from a PBR.
