## Title: SSRS: Tweak  Squeak
## Abstract:
### When you just can't seem to make your report look the way you want it to, consider using Custom Code snippets.  Learn about doing custom formatting, report documentation, and even using SSRS to generate file extracts.  We will also look at a tweak to the rsReportServer.config file to configure custom export formats.  We'll wrap up with a report on the ExecutionLog table that will give us an idea of which reports are our problem children.
