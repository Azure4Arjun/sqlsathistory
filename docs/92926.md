## Speaker: Chris Bell
## Title: MSAs, GMSAs,  Groups - Use SQL without traditional user accounts
## Abstract:
### Security is becoming more critical in today’s database environment. At times it can seem like the DBA is also a Domain Admin and Security team on top of everything else. 
Managing user domain accounts access in your DB can get tedious fast, especially as your environment grows. In this session, we will discuss and see some Active Directory features that can help re-enforce the concept of the separation of duties when it comes to security and ways to reduce the risks and complexities in managing a SQL environment’s security. We will review the process and requirements for implementing AD Groups, Active Directory’s Managed Service Accounts (MSA) and Group MSAs to be used to manage access and operate your SQL environment.
