## Title: In-Memory OLTP for Developers: What You Need to Know
## Abstract:
### With the significant improvements made to in-memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016, itâ€™s natural to expect significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  

In this session, we are going to take a look at in-memory tables, their best use cases as well as development best practices. We will also look at the changes to the indexing design for inMemory-based objects and how it differs from existing disk-based table indexing. Finally, we are going to cover how to build fast, scalable applications which utilize inMemory objects, as well as choosing the appropriate indexes for your inMemory objects to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.
