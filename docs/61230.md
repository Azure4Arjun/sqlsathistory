## Abstract:
### Come round to talk about Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and deployment/delivery of Business Intelligence (BI) Applications! You will learn how to manage and deploy a full stack BI solution with Team Foundation Server (TFS). I will share my view of end-to-end architecture of MS BI ALM and practical tips on how to make it happen with TFS toolkit, with specific examples for every MS BI project type. The presentation will also compare features of Release Manager and Octopus Deploy for your deployment needs will show a demo of continuous deployment for a typical BI project using TFS. The material does not assume prior knowledge of TFS administration, but some experience using Visual Studio database projects and general TFS terminology will be helpful.
