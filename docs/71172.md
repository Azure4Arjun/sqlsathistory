## Title: Six Degrees of Sql Family? - An introduction to Graph Databases in SQL Server and CosmosDB
## Abstract:
### In this Session we will look at the theory and use of a Graph Database and its implementation in SQL Server 2017 and CosmosDB

The session will cover 
     What is a Graph Database?
     Why are they useful? What problems do they solve?
     How are they implemented in SQL Server and Cosmos DB.
  
In particular we will take the Speaker Data from 700+ SQLSaturday events to investigate the Social Network that underlies SQLFamily. Just how connected is everyone in the Microsoft Data Community?
