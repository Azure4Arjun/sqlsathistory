## Title: Tracking Data Transformations Using Temporal Tables
## Abstract:
### Along with change tracking and change data capture Microsoft has introduced a new method for tracking data changes within its databases called Temporal tables.  Microsoft introduced temporal, or system-versioned, tables in SQL Server 2016 as a new database feature. A temporal table truly introduces two tables into the mix: one for current data and another for historical data. This talk will show how the feature is implemented and used along with a discussion on the common usage for temporal tables. Comparison to change tracking and change data capture will also be discussed. Scripts will be explored for the automation of the creation of temporal tables along with its use in data warehousing.
