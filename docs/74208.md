## Abstract:
### String data is far more complex than most people are aware of. The US English alphabet and punctuation (i.e. standard ASCII) are relatively simple, but they make up a very small portion of the alphabets and non-language symbols that can be represented. Given the increasing need to handle multiple languages, it is important to understand collations and encodings before getting collation mismatch errors or losing data.

In this presentation we will cover: the actual differences between VARCHAR and NVARCHAR, what Collations are and can do, binary collations (and why they aren't truly case sensitive), SQL Server vs Windows collations, supplementary characters and surrogate pairs, Collation Precedence, Code Pages, ASCII / Unicode / UTF-8 / UTF-16 / UCS-2 encodings, combining characters, what server-level and database-level default collations do, ramifications of changing a database's collation, multi-byte character sets, NVARCHAR to VARCHAR "best fit" mappings, and other fascinating topics.
