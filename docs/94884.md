## Speaker: Jordan Anderson
## Title: Real-Time IoT Analytics at the Edge
## Abstract:
### As the velocity of device data increases, the promise of the Cloud is often limited by the latency of the office Internet connection.  Leveraging the power of Azure, we will deploy real-time analytics at the edge and illustrate how performing high-frequency analysis is possible.

In this session, we will cover the basics of Azure Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Stream Analytics, then we will deploy Stream Analytics at the edge using a Raspberry Pi device connected to the Azure IoT ecosystem.

No prior Azure IoT or Azure Stream Analytics knowledge is required to benefit from this session.
