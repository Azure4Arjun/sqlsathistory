## Title: Advanced SQL Server troubleshooting with SQLCallStackResolver
## Abstract:
### Troubleshooting spinlock contention, strange wait types, AVs and asserts is no longer a black box. With the availability of SQLCallStackResolver (http://aka.ms/sqlstack) you can start uncovering the true reasons for a particular behavior within SQL Server, without having to open WinDbg! This tool can potentially save you a call to Microsoft Support (or at least go much better prepared to them!) In this session you will be presented live demos of how SQLCallStackResolver has helped in real-life cases, both for SQL Server on Windows and SQL Server on Linux. Latch contention, spinlock contention, AVs are no longer a mystery with this tool. Come and see how you can tackle the most difficult and advanced SQL Server troubleshooting scenarios yourself!
