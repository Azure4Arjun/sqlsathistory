## Title: Data Migration Between SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Data must often be relocated to a different SQL server, when consolidating or upgrading servers or databases. This session details experiences from numerous such moves, using a number of different techniques. We talk about why you might do such a thing, which approaches are available (with what trade-offs), and some of the things that sometimes get forgotten. And especially, how to handle SQL-based apps for a move.
