## Title: Data cleaning with SSIS - SQL 2012
## Abstract:
### Having clean data is a critical component in data warehousing and business intelligence systems.  With the release of SQL Server 2012 Microsoft has provided a powerful tool to help organizations in tackling their data quality issues.  We will look at this new Data Quality Services tool, its strengths and weaknesses.  We will also looks at some customizations that can be built to handle some tasks better, such as pattern matching.  The focus will be on how SSIS can help clean the data that will eventually end up in your warehouse.
