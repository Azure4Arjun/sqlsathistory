## Title: Gentle Introduction to T-SQL Window Functions
## Abstract:
### Since their infancy in SQL Server 2005 and their growth spurt in SQL Server 2012, T-SQL window functions have provided new ways to solve fairly common end-user query requests. However, their successful use requires thinking a little differently about sets than you're used to. In this session, you will explore the basic concepts of ordering, partitioning and framing. Everything will be demonstrated with easy to follow examples that you will be able to adapt quickly to your query needs.
