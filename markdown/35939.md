## Title: Optimal Infrastructure Strategies for Cisco UCS, Nexus and SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Efficiently managing today’s SQL Server database infrastructure is more challenging than at any time in the past.Today’s server platforms have more computing power and capacity than ever before, but there are also moredatabase applications, many of which need to have very high performance in addition to very high availability.These requirements must also be balanced with an ongoing need for more efficiency and lower infrastructurecosts.In this presentation, you’ll learn why the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is the optimum platform fordeploying and leveraging the new features in SQL Server 2014. Cisco UCS has a unique and advanced serverdesign that solves many of the business problems faced by legacy servers. You’ll learn how Cisco UCS’s featuresenable you to more rapidly provision and deploy servers, optimize online transaction processing (OLTP) andbusiness intelligence (BI) workloads, and improve the availability of business-critical workloads.
