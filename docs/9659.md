## Title: 5 Ways SSIS 2012 can Save You Time and Money
## Abstract:
### Integration Services in SQL Server 2012 gives DBAs and BI developers new features that save time and money in terms of development and management. Whether you're automating DBA tasks, ETL processes, or System Integrations, SSIS has something for everyone. 

Come learn about:

-Improvements in the design interface 
-SSIS Parameters 
-Easier Deployment with the SSIS Catalog 
-New Standard Reports for monitoring SSIS 
-New ways to control SSIS on the server. 

If you're on SQL Server 2008, not to worry. I will show you an additional 3rd party tool that gives you a lot of this functionality. But nothing beats the ROI with SSIS 2012.
