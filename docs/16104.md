## Speaker: Jose Chinchilla
## Title: Change Data Capture a developer's unknown best friend
## Abstract:
### Wish there was a way to identify data that has been inserted, deleted and updated with minimal overhead and without he use of triggers? Looking for a way to validate the impact on the data by the new code you are about to deploy in Production? Wish there was a way to quickly recover and revert changes made to the data already committed when not using explicit transactions?  Want to speed up your incremental ETLs? Join Jose to learn more about Change Data Capture (CDC) in SQL Server and understand how developers can utilize this tool to debug code, document code impact on the data, identify data that has been inserted, updated or deleted data and how it can be used to restore changed data in seconds to its original state without the use of backups or snapshots.
