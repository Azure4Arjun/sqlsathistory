## Title: Moving and Transforming Your Data with Azure Data Factory V2
## Abstract:
### Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that automates data movement and data transformation using both cloud and on-premises data sources and destinations. This introductory session will cover basic components of an ADF solution including integration runtimes, linked services, datasets, pipelines, activities, and triggers. We'll also discuss the development environment and integration with source control as well as monitoring. This session will include demos to show you how to build, execute, and monitor a pipeline. And since Data Factory is frequently updated with new features, we'll look at some of the latest releases. If you have been waiting to dip your toe in the ADF waters, this is your chance to learn the basics and ask questions.
