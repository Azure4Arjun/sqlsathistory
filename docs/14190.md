## Title: Monitoring MDX Queries in Analysis Services (IT)
## Abstract:
### If you are able to answer to questions like “How many people use your OLAP solution?”, “How many MDX queries are performed daily on your Analysis Services instances?”, “What is the average response time of an MDX query on your servers?” THIS SESSION IS NOT FOR YOU!!!Otherwise, in this session we will see how is it possible to implement a monitoring tool using resources already available on our servers such as PowerShell, SQL Server Profiler, Reporting Services, and simple XMLA commands.Finally, we will see how further enrich the presented solution providing also the ability to identify the most problematic MDX queries, run performance measures on them and obtain a summary report that identifies any bottlenecks specifying whether they reside in the Storage or Formula Engine of Analysis Services All this in a fully automatic way!The solution presented is currently being used successfully by SolidQ at some customers in Italy.
