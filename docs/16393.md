## Speaker: Jen Stirrup
## Title: The Accidental Business Intelligence Project Manager
## Abstract:
### You’ve heard that Business Intelligence projects are prone to failure. 
You’ve watched the Apprentice with Donald Trump and Lord Alan Sugar. 
You know that the Project Manager is usually the one gets fired. 
You know that a quick Bing search for ‘why do Business Intelligence projects fail?’ produces a search result of 25 million hits! 

Despite all this… you’re now Business Intelligence Project Manager – now what do you do? In this session, Jen will provide a ‘sparks from the anvil’ series of steps and working practices in Business Intelligence Project Management. What about waterfall vs agile? What is a Gantt chart anyway? 

Jen will give you some ideas and insights that will help you set your BI project right: assess priorities, avoid conflict, empower the BI team and deliver the Business Intelligence project successfully!
