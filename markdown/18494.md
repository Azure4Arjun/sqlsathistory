## Title: Plan Caching in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Plan Caching is the most powerful concept in SQL Server. But on the other hand it's also the most dangerous thing that can lead to queries that are executed with a completely wrong Execution Plan. In this session we will have a more detailed look into the Plan Cache of SQL Server, in which different ways SQL Server can cache Execution Plans in the Plan Cache, and how you can troubleshooting wrong performing queries directly from the Plan Cache.
