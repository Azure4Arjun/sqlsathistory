## Title: Introduction to SQL executions plans
## Abstract:
### Have you ever seen an execution plan and been totally lost as to what it means or what you can learn from it? We'll cover the basics of execution plans - how the SQL Server assembles the query, different types of joins, and why the query engine makes those decisions. We'll also look at common reasons why the query optimizer can make less-than-optimal decisions, and how you can improve the query layout or the the object metadata to help improve the execution plan and speed up the results.
