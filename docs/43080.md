## Title: Using SQL Server 2016 and R Integration
## Abstract:
### With SQL Server 2016 (CTP 3 release) R Language for statistical programming is now supported with native T-SQL. With this extension we can now integrate powerful R Language with transactional data directly using SSMS.

In this session we will go through:
1) Installation needed (R and RRO by Revolution Analytics (now Microsoft)
2) Exploring the usage of RRO Engine (multi-threated usage and parallel multi-core usage of CPU,...)
3) Using T-SQL for Data analysis with importing and exporting data to SQL Tables
4) Demos with using Predictions on datasets and exploring usability of Reporting services (SSRS) and Power BI (integration with R now possible).

Session is useful for BI analysts as well as for DEV and DBA as we can easily make server monitoring and use of predictions for server monitoring (predicting when disk will be full and any other extended events).
