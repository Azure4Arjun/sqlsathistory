## Title: Bridging The Gap
## Abstract:
### For many who come to T-SQL from other languages, dealing with result sets and thinking in set based solutions can be frustrating.  Our minds are conditioned to think in processing rows of data, not entire sets. As a consequence many give up and misuse cursors or come up with other ways to create RBAR (Row By Agonizing Row) solutions. Some others try to deal with sets but get caught in the tangle of nested queries. In this session I will deal with Table Expressions with particular emphasis on CTEs or Common Table Expressions.  Let me show you how using these simple tools can help simplify your code, bridging the gap between RBAR and set based solutions.
