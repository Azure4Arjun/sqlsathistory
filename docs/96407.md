## Title: Functions - the good, the bad and the really, really ugly.
## Abstract:
### Scalar functions have a bad reputation in SQL Server, and for good reason. In this presentation I’m going to show the problems that scalar functions cause, in terms of performance and why they’re so hard to see in many cases.

I’ll show you how to replace simple scalar functions with an in-line table-valued function that performs far better. We’ll also look at the improvements to functions in sql server 2019.
