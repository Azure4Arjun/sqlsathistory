## Title: Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution
## Abstract:
### This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty quickly with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for those of you that have created jobs using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.
