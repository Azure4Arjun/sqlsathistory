## Title: Reporting for Developers
## Abstract:
### Power BI and Reporting Services can both be addressed with different programming languages, but have fundamentally different developer stories.
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is fully integrated with Visual Studio to provide a comprehensive development environment and full support for Application LIfecycle Management. SSRS also provides a good API for automatic generation of mass reports. Power BI has more strengths in the management area, but offers fewer possibilities in the programmatic development of reports. Power BI in the embedded flavor offers previously unavailable functions in the integration of a comprehensive reporting platform into own applications.

In this session, we will take a detailed look at the possibilities offered by the different platforms. We show when and where each platform can best be used, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Using many examples and demos, we show which functions the individual platforms offer and which challenges await the developer.
