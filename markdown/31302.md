## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: End to End Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server can be very difficult. It often takes years of on-the-job experience to learn how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem. This hands-on session will take you from the very start of a problem situation on SQL Server, showing you how to use the native tools that help you keep SQL Server at top performance.
