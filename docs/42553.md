## Title: SQL Server 2016: A Monster of a Release
## Abstract:
### Without a doubt SQL Server 2016 will be a monster of a release. It will easily eclipse all other versions of SQL Server that have been released in scope of features, technology and breadth of vision. No wonder Gartner has positioned Microsoft as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems. More importantly, Microsoft is placed furthest in vision and highest for ability to execute within the Leaders Quadrant.
In this session we will examine SQL Server 2016 and have a look at what's new in the Database Engine, Analysis Services, Reporting Services and Integration Services. We will highlight the "big ticket" items and discuss the business cases for using the technology and features.
We will also discuss Microsoft's vision for the Data Platform and how SQL Server will evolve in the future.
