## Title: Understanding SQL Server 2016 Always Encrypted
## Abstract:
### Always Encrypted is a highly-touted new feature of SQL Server 2016 that promises to make encryption simple to use and transparent to applications while still protecting the data both at rest and in motion, even from high-privilege users such as developers and DBAs.  Does that sound too good to be true?  It isn’t - Always Encrypted is an incredible feature - but like any new technology, it does have some limitations.  In this session, you’ll see how to configure Always Encrypted, and we’ll talk about when you should and shouldn’t use it in your environment.
