## Title: Extent and Page Management in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In this session (level 300-400) you will learn how SQL Server physically stores data in pages and how they are grouped together based on IAM -, PFS, GAM, SGAM pages and extents.
Additionally, we will have a look into partitions and allocation units and the different types of pages like in-row, row-overflow (row overflow pointer) and LOB. 
Also, we will dump a data page to analyze the page header and translate the payload with the FixedVarFormat.
