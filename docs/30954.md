## Title: Implementing a Data Cleansing Component for SSIS
## Abstract:
### To ensure consistency across data integrated from multiple systems, the application of standard data cleansing routines is a best practice. Examples of data cleansing include translation of NULL values to defaults, trimming string values, and consistent formatting for textual data such as telephone and social security numbers. While these routines can be implemented using standard SSIS components, the resulting logic must be duplicated for each source and column which creates a development and maintenance burden.  This session will walk through the process of creating common data cleansing routines in a custom component to enable code reuse with minimal effort across many packages.
