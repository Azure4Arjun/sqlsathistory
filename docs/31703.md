## Speaker: Alejandro Mesa
## Title: Parameter Sniffing
## Abstract:
### Is your stored procedure, prepared statement, or ad-hoc query taking to long after a good start? 

Learn what is parameter sniffing, how it could affect your query response time, and what can we do when it doesn't help. In this session we will learn about recompiling, OPTION clause, and plan guides.
