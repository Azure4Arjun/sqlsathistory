## Title: Reporting Services: A Smart Migration Strategy
## Abstract:
### With Power BI Report Server, you can host traditional paginated reports alongside Power BI analytical reports, KPIs and mobile reports.  This session will show how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine a smart migration strategy for upgrading to a new SSRS or Power BI Report Server. Starting with the new features of Report Manager, Mobile reports, KPIs and the Mobile Report Publisher app. The session will then focus on how to utilize the report meta data in the ReportServer database, combined with the transaction log table, to show how to determine which reports, data sets and data sources are being used and determine what objects to migrate. Learn how to use PowerShell to extract the reports and data sets from the database, instead of downloading them, to facilitate an easy migration to a new implementation. Also discover a way of determining all TSQL used by the reports. This session is particularly useful for migrating from 2008 but applicable to any migration.
