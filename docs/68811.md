## Title: Getting graphy with CosmosDB Graph API with Gremlin
## Abstract:
### CosmosDB was announced at Build 2017 as an extension to Microsoft's DocumentDB offering and is positioned to be a key component of the Microsoft Data Platform. In this session, we will explore CosmosDB's graph API that is built using Apache's TinkerPop and Gremlin projects. Graph databases allow you to build a powerful data model that explores connections and paths between data. At the end of this session, attendees will have a solid understanding of what a graph database is and how you can use Gremlin and the .NET API to interact with a graph database.
