## Speaker: Sven Aelterman
## Title: SQL Server Optimization for SharePoint
## Abstract:
### DBAs know that SharePoint just doesn't play nice with SQL Server. SharePoint administrators know that DBAs just don't understand SharePoint. This session will show hands-on how to get a SQL Server instance set up effectively for SharePoint 2013. It's not black magic and it doesn't involve undocumented trace flags. Maybe DBAs and SharePoint admins can't get along in social circles, but at least you'll be able to cooperate after this session.
