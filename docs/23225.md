## Title: The Incredible Shrinking Execution Plan
## Abstract:
### The Query Optimizer can do amazing things with your queries to work out the best plan. If you're aware of some of techniques it uses, you can leverage this to make your plans be tighter than ever, resulting in better performance and even provide an easier platform for developers who feel less confident with T-SQL. These ideas can even help you query systems such as Microsoft Dynamics in better ways.
