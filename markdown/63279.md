## Title: Designing High Availability Database Systems using AlwaysOn Availability Groups
## Abstract:
### Are you looking for a high availability solution for your business critical application? You're heard about AlwaysOn Availability Groups and they seem like a good solution, but you don't know where to start. It all starts with a solid design. In this session we introduce the core concepts needed to design a Availability Group based system. Covering topics such as recovery objectives, replica placement, failover requirements, synchronization models, quorum, backup and recovery and monitoring. This session is modeled after real world client engagements conducted by Centino Systems that have lead to many successful Availability Groups based systems supporting tier 1 business critical applications.
