Event Date: 09-05-2015 - Session time: 10:15:00 - Track: Enterprise BI
## Speaker: Steve Schneider
## Title: Government Transparency Powered by SharePoint 2013 and Sql 2012
## Abstract:
### I will bring to life how SQL 2012 empowers the BI of SharePoint BI.  Meaning...what parts of SQL yield what parts of SharePoint BI.  Where are the SQL parts, where can you see and manage them?  How does the consumer see them.  How can you tell what the consumer is seeing?  What tools are used to build what parts of SharePoint BI?  Real-life examples of how SharePoint BI is implemented in the City of Jacksonville will be used as examples.  See how your city is using Microsoft Technology to open up the city's data to its citizens.  Think PowerView and Excel (services).
