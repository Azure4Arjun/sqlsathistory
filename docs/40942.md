## Title: Use  Visual Studio to create a solid database from conception to production
## Abstract:
### Developers have been using Visual Studio for years to create apps that connect to your database. Why not use Visual Studio to create your database and help you keep it running fast and lean? Come learn how to use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) in Visual Studio to create tables, views, stored procedures, users and more. These database objects can be tied together during development which means no more procedure calls to misspelled tables, no more inconsistent column names and no more orphaned objects. We will also cover how easy it is to publish changes to different environments. Come join us and find out how you can add Visual Studio to your tool belt and help bring joy to your database development lifecycle process.
