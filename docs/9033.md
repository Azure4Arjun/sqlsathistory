## Title: Storage Tuning Deep Dive
## Abstract:
### In this talk we will look at squeezing the maximum out of your storage systems. We will work on  a live system testing concepts like short-stroking for performance. We will also show how some of these techniques are still valid on systems with SSD’s in the mix. We will cover some basics you need to know then dive into configuring local disk systems and how to test them to measure the gains or loses. This session is geared to the DBA who has a working knowledge of storage and how SQL Server works with the file system.

Takeaways:
1.	How to configure spinning disk for maximum IO or maximum throughput
2.	How to keep your SSD’s from suffering the write cliff and keep performance strong
3.	Using the DVD Store 2 benchmark to test with SQL Server installed
4.	Using ioMeter to test disks directly
