## Title: "Job Searches, Resumes, LinkedIn and Interviews are Fun" -said No One Ever
## Abstract:
### Find out what hiring managers really want to see throughout the hiring process.  This session will walk through the basics that every successful candidate should know from soup to nuts:  LinkedIn Profile Best Practices, Resume tips, Job search and Interview tips.  Yes, of course recruiters, hiring managers and even technical screeners view your LinkedIn page; but, did you realize they also view your twitter account, your blog, your Facebook and that webpage you designed freshman year in college?  If you are in a job search, considering one or there is a chance you could ever end up in one (that's all of you, unless you are retiring today or independently wealthy and just have nothing better to do on Saturdays) then this session will be a great opportunity to find out what "they" are really looking for and acquire a complete guide on how to land that dream job quickly.

## Speaker: Jason Virtue
## Title: Power BI Data Visualizations
## Abstract:
### Many of us over the years have wanted to customize legend colors, axis or title labels in Power BI.  Each one of us have thought I really want to use a different type of visualization that is not available in Power BI.  This session will help answer these questions and showcase the new out-of-the-box visualizations, changing chart properties and new custom visualizations.  Microsoft enables developers thru D3.js, SVG and other graphical technologies to create their own custom visualizations.  The new chart types will be able to be published into Power BI so you can leverage any visualization that you want to use from Box chart to sunburst diagrams.  This session will showcase the new features and discuss at a high-level what you need to get started creating your own visualizations.

## Speaker: Jean-Paul Antona
## Title: The Health Data Initiative: A Quick Start Guide for Entrepreneurs
## Abstract:
### After the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began publishing weather data for free download three decades ago, entrepreneurs across the country began to leverage this easily accessible data to power applications and services that benefit the American people: weather newscasts, mobile applications, insurance, and research. The same pattern of private-sector innovations occurred when Global Positioning System data became openly available in the 1980s. 

Now the Health and Human Services Department has made health data free and easily accessible through the Health Data Initiative -- making data from HHS' vaults (from CMS, CDC, FDA and NIH, to name a few sources) available to innovators across the country. In this session, we will explore what data is available, demonstrate how easily the data can be visualized with tools like Tableau or SSRS, and consider the field of opportunities available to improve an industry that is clearly under pressure for data-driven innovation.

## Speaker: Michael Antonovich
## Title: Calculated Columns, Measures, and KPIs, Oh My!
## Abstract:
### To do serious work in a Power Pivot table or even a SQL Analytics Cube, you must know the difference between calculated columns, measures, and KPIs, how to define them, use them, and display them.  This session will take you step by step through the creation of each of these components of a typical pivot table or cube showing you how to define the necessary expressions and then how they are displayed in tables and charts that transform mere data into meaningful managerial information.  To keep examples simple enough for all attendees to go back and try on their own, Excel Power Pivot Tables will be used, but the same techniques apply almost without change to SSAS cubes.

## Speaker: Allen Ellison
## Title: Datazen, Where does it fit?
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has done an amazing job with providing many different tools and options for visually displaying data. From Reporting Services to PowerBI, and everything in between, there are targeted reasons for each of these tools. In the past few years, it has become increasingly important for reporting and dashboarding in the mobile BI realm. Although PowerBI is very mobile friendly, it’s purpose is mainly for end-user analytics.

Enter Datazen. Datazen offers executive level visualization for displaying charts, graphs, KPI’s and interactive timelines across all mobile devices. This presentation is an opportunity to see how simple it can be for IT to get started with the server-side configuration, and allow power users the opportunity to create dashboards for their own audience.

# Know Thyself. The Path to Self-Service BI Success
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#476---Tampa---BI-Edition-2015)
Event Date: 14-11-2015 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Data Quality / Misc
## Speaker: Edward Kench
## Title: Know Thyself. The Path to Self-Service BI Success
## Abstract:
### How ready is the business for your self-service BI tools? How ready are your tools for the business? Are you waiting for users to "adopt" your BI capabilities? 

In this session, we will discuss finding the self-service sweet spot between data, BI, and business priorities that maximizes analytical value and minimizes development costs and efforts. Different types of users will be discussed and the self-service strategies that can be employed for each. For example, the CEO is likely to want a different view of the data than a product analyst. Let's talk about when to pivot and when to scatter.

Examples will be shown using Microsoft Power BI. 

Instead of waiting for users to adopt, get them to EMBRACE self-service BI tools as a key component of business success.

We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!
