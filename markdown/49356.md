## Title: How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance
## Abstract:
### This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.
