## Speaker: Alexander Klein
## Title: BI in Azure two years live
## Abstract:
### After more than two years live with BI in Azure Alexander Klein would like to give an honest feedback. 

Which architecture is the right one? Which tools/services should I use ( Azure Data Factory V1 or V2, Azure Stream Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Analysis Service, Azure Data Lake, Power BI, Azure Databricks ...) ?
What was good and what wasn't so good? What do you have to pay attention to? What can you possibly do better in the next project?

Alexander Klein will answer all these questions and more in this presentation.
