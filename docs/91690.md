## Title: Introduction to PowerApps
## Abstract:
### PowerApps is an O365 service that lets you build business apps that can run in the browser, tablet, or phone. To build PowerApps, no coding experience is required since PowerApps combines visual drag-and-drop concepts with Excel-like expressions for building the logic and working with data. You can build PowerApps against a modern SharePoint list or other types of data such as SQL and Excel. PowerApps also provides templates and sample data you can use to quickly build an app that you can customize to better suit your needs. In this session, you will learn the basics to building a PowerApp using PowerApps Studio.
