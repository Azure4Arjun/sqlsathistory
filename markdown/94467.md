## Title: XML?  What’s this doing in my database?
## Abstract:
### As a DBA, we’re responsible for making sure our systems run optimally at all times.  We know about Extended Events and how to use XQuery to access them.  So what happens when we have XML data in user tables?  
In this session, we’ll learn how XML data can be stored in the database, how to index it appropriately for performance, and tips and tricks to make your SQL queries against XML data faster.
