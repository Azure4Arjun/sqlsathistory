## Title: Create a Time Travelling Database
## Abstract:
### You've created a table or two to store historical data but how about an entire database?  This talk will give you the tools the tools to create a temporal database using current and past relational databases. 
 Learn how to store and query temporal data but, more importantly, how to think about data as it changes over time.  Spoiler: it does not involve SQL Server's new Temporal Tables, data warehousing, etc.  It can all be done in your current database.
