## Title: How to Deploy SQL Server Containers on Kubernetes in Azure
## Abstract:
### When Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 it allowed us to run SQL Server in docker containers. This radical change provides a wider and open platform that data professionals can choose how to deploy and run SQL Server. 

This session will demonstrate how containers are a game changer for deploying and managing SQL Server.  It  will also showcase how the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a scalable and highly available platform for SQL Server running in containers. 

Demonstrations will show how easy it is to create containers, deploy SQL Server in them and how to automate and manage your SQL Server containers using Kubernetes on the Azure platform.

This session will show you the exciting future of SQL Server and you will walk away with knowledge of practical scenarios where SQL Server running in containers on Kubernetes may be the right deployment model for you.
