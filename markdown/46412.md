## Title: Beginning SQL Server Investigation and Troubleshooting
## Abstract:
### You have just been handed the keys to the kingdom - unfortunately, you've also been handed all of the responsibility to ensure that everything is running as expected.  In this session we will take a high level look at topics which will be necessary for properly ensuring that your servers are running as flawlessly as possible. We will discuss what SQL Server is telling us through its' dynamic management objects, some great tools from the community on how to interpret these signals as well as how to set up maintenance, and finally how we will diagnose what is going on when your server is having issues.
