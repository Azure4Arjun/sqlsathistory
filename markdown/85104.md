## Title: Detecting and Capturing Change for Data Warehousing
## Abstract:
### There are many ways of detecting and capturing changes to the data in your business system in order to populate your data warehouse.  In this session we will compare and contrast several methods for loading slowly-changing dimensions in your ETL solutions, including SSIS design patterns, T-SQL code, change data capture (CDC) and temporal tables.

Attendees will gain a full understanding of the pros and cons of each of these solutions and become confident in choosing and implementing them in their own ETL solutions.
